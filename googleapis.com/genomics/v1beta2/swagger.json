A read is equivalent to a line in a SAM file. A read belongs to exactly one read group and exactly one read group set. Generating a reference-aligned sequence string When interacting with mapped reads, it's often useful to produce a string representing the local alignment of the read to reference. The following pseudocode demonstrates one way of doing this:\nout = \"\" offset = 0 for c in read.alignment.cigar { switch c.operation { case \"ALIGNMENT_MATCH\", \"SEQUENCE_MATCH\", \"SEQUENCE_MISMATCH\": out += read.alignedSequence[offset:offset+c.operationLength] offset += c.operationLength break case \"CLIP_SOFT\", \"INSERT\": offset += c.operationLength break case \"PAD\": out += repeat(\"*\", c.operationLength) break case \"DELETE\": out += repeat(\"-\", c.operationLength) break case \"SKIP\": out += repeat(\" \", c.operationLength) break case \"CLIP_HARD\": break } } return out\nConverting to SAM's CIGAR string The following pseudocode generates a SAM CIGAR string from the cigar field. Note that this is a lossy conversion (cigar.referenceSequence is lost).\ncigarMap = { \"ALIGNMENT_MATCH\": \"M\", \"INSERT\": \"I\", \"DELETE\": \"D\", \"SKIP\": \"N\", \"CLIP_SOFT\": \"S\", \"CLIP_HARD\": \"H\", \"PAD\": \"P\", \"SEQUENCE_MATCH\": \"=\", \"SEQUENCE_MISMATCH\": \"X\", } cigarStr = \"\" for c in read.alignment.cigar { cigarStr += c.operationLength + cigarMap[c.operation] } return cigarStr",
