If this is impossible - e.g. the enterprise has not purchased sufficient licenses - then installation fails.\n\nNote that entitlements are always user specific, not device specific; a user may have an entitlement even though they have not installed the app anywhere. Once they have an entitlement they can install the app on multiple devices.\n\nThe API can be used to create an entitlement. If the app is a free app, a group license for that app is created.
