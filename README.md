[![APIs in collection](https://apis-guru.github.io/api-models/apis_in_collection_banner.svg)](./APIs)[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/APIs-guru/api-models](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/APIs-guru/api-models?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)<BR>
Repository for API models in [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) [2.0](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) format

Our goal is to create a machine-readable Wikipedia for REST APIs, with the following principals:
- Open source, community driven project
- Only publicly available APIs (free or paid).
- Anyone can add or change an API, not only API owners.
- All data can be accessed through a [REST API](API.md).

If you want to reference this project and you need an icon or even a banner, check our [branding guide](branding/README.md).

[You can also support the project using BountySource](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/apis_guru)<br>
Also, we provide services and consultancy around the Swagger spec and REST APIs in general.
You can contact us at founders@apis.guru.

Licenses
--------------------------

All code is released under the [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) licence.<br>
All API specs contributed to project by authors is covered by the [CC01.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license.<br>
All API specs acquired from public sources under the [Fair use](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) principal.

API spec acceptance criteria
--------------------------
* Public - anyone can access it as long as they follow some clearly defined steps (email owner, pay money, etc.).
* Persistant - API is made with long-lived goal, and not for a particular event (conference, hackathon, etc.).
* Useful - API could provide useful functionality not only for its owner.

Future additions
--------------------------
We are currently working on adding many new API specs, you can see the full list inside [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14zxKcW_Pzu5aYI3Tnwe5ph2Ru2pkSP8yHWEQhx3t8pI/edit?usp=sharing) document.<BR>
If you have an API spec in any format (Swagger, RAML, WADL, ...) for any public API, please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/APIs-guru/api-models/issues/new).

Integration with 3rd-party services
--------------------------
We discourage you from using Github RAW links or Git directly, repository structure isn't stable and could be changed in future.
Instead, we strongly recomend you to use our [REST API](API.md).<BR>
In case if you really need it, we also support [APIs.json](http://apisjson.org/) format:<BR>
