# openapi-directory

The Speakeasy OpenAPI Directory is a fork of APIs.guru's [openapi-directory](https://github.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory). 

The repository contains a collection of OpenAPI definitions for public APIs and SDKs generated by Speakeasy's own [SDK Generator](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/speakeasy).

The SDKs are generated from the `valid` OpenAPI v3 definitions in the `APIs` directory. There are a number of SDKs for various languages that can be found in the `SDKs` directory. These SDKs are free to use and should run with little modification.
