core.ac.uk,CORE API v2 (beta),"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This is a documentation for CORE API v2.0. The CORE API is the programming 
    interface to <a href=""http://core-project.kmi.open.ac.uk/"">CORE</a>. You can use the API to access the 
    resources harvested and enriched by CORE. The API described here is currently in beta. If you 
    encounter any problems with the API, please report them to us.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The API is organised by resource type. The resources are <b>articles</b>, 
    <b>journals</b> and <b>repositories</b> and are represented using JSON data format. Furthermore, 
    each resource has a list of methods. The API also provides two global methods for accessing all resources at once.</p>

<h2>Response format</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Response for each query contains two fields: <b>status</b> and <b>data</b>.
    In case of an error status, the data field is empty. The data field contains a single object
    in case the request is for a specific identifier (e.g. CORE ID, CORE repository ID, etc.), or  
    contains a list of objects, for example for search queries. In case of batch requests, the response
    is an array of objects, each of which contains its own <b>status</b> and <b>data</b> fields.
    For search queries the response contains an additional field <b>totalHits</b>, which is the 
    total number of items which match the search criteria.</p>

<h2>Search query syntax</h2>

<p style=""text-align: justify"">All of the API search methods allow using complex search queries.
    The query can be a simple string or it can be built using terms and operators described in Elasticsearch
    <a href=""http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.4/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax"">documentation</a>.
    The usable field names are <strong>title</strong>, <strong>description</strong>, <strong>fullText</strong>, 
    <strong>authorsString</strong>, <strong>publisher</strong>, <strong>repositoryIds</strong>, <strong>doi</strong>,
    <strong>identifiers</strong> (which is a list of article identifiers including OAI, URL, etc.), <strong>language.name</strong> 
    and <strong>year</strong>. Some example queries:
</p>

<ul style=""margin-left: 30px;"">
    <li><p>title:psychology and language.name:English</p></li>
    <li><p>repositoryIds:86 AND year:2014</p></li>
    <li><p>identifiers:""oai:aura.abdn.ac.uk:2164/3837"" OR identifiers:""oai:aura.abdn.ac.uk:2164/3843""</p></li>
    <li><p>doi:""10.1186/1471-2458-6-309""</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Sort order</h2>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For search queries, the results are ordered by relevance score. For batch 
    requests, the results are retrieved in the order of the requests.</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The API methods allow different parameters to be passed. Additionally, there is an API key parameter which is common to all API methods. For all API methods 
    the API key can be provided either as a query parameter or in the request header. If the API key 
    is not provided, the API will return HTTP 401 error. You can register for an API key <a href=""/intro/api"">here</a>.</p>

geneea.com,Geneea Natural Language Processing,"<div class=""api-description"">
    <h2>Authentication</h2>
    <p>For all calls, supply your API key. <a href=""https://geneea.3scale.net/"">Sign up to <em>obtain the key</em></a>.</p>
    <p>
        Our API supports both <em>unencrypted (HTTP)</em> and <em>encrypted (HTTPS)</em> protocols.
        However, for security reasons, we strongly encourage using only the encrypted version.
    </p>
    <p>The API key should be supplied as either a request parameter <code>user_key</code> or in <code>Authorization</code> header.</p>
    <pre><code>Authorization: user_key &lt;YOUR_API_KEY&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>API operations</h2>
    <p>
        All API operations can perform analysis on supplied raw text or on text extracted from a given URL.
        Optionally, one can supply additional information which can make the result more precise. An example
        of such information would be the language of text or a particular text extractor for URL resources.
    </p>
    <p>The supported types of analyses are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>lemmatization</strong> &longrightarrow;
            Finds out lemmata (basic forms) of all the words in the document.
        </li>
        <li><strong>correction</strong> &longrightarrow;
            Performs correction (diacritization) on all the words in the document.
        </li>
        <li><strong>topic detection</strong> &longrightarrow;
            Determines a topic of the document, e.g. finance or sports.
        </li>
        <li><strong>sentiment analysis</strong> &longrightarrow;
            Determines a sentiment of the document, i.e. how positive or negative the document is.
        </li>
        <li><strong>named entity recognition</strong> &longrightarrow;
            Finds named entities (like person, location, date etc.) mentioned the the document.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Encoding</h2>
    <p>The supplied text is expected to be in UTF-8 encoding, this is especially important for non-english texts.</p>

    <h2>Returned values</h2>
    <p>The API calls always return objects in serialized JSON format in UTF-8 encoding.</p>
    <p>
        If any error occurs, the HTTP response code will be in the range <code>4xx</code> (client-side error) or
        <code>5xx</code> (server-side error). In this situation, the body of the response will contain information
        about the error in JSON format, with <code>exception</code> and <code>message</code> values.
    </p>

    <h2>URL limitations</h2>
    <p>
        All the requests are semantically <code>GET</code>. However, for longer texts, you may run into issues
        with URL length limit. Therefore, it's possible to always issue a <code>POST</code> request with all
        the parameters encoded as a JSON in the request body.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre><code>
        POST /s1/sentiment
        Content-Type: application/json

        {""text"":""There is no harm in being sometimes wrong - especially if one is promptly found out.""}
    </code></pre>
    <p>This is equivalent to <code>GET /s1/sentiment?text=There%20is%20no%20harm...</code></p>

    <h2>Request limitations</h2>
    <p>
        The API has other limitations concerning the size of the HTTP requests. The maximal allowed size of any
        POST request body is <em>512 KiB</em>. For request with a URL resource, the maximal allowed number of
        extracted characters from each such resource is <em>100,000</em>.
    </p>

import.io,API Documentation,"## Introduction

The import.io API is a [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)ful API. It is designed as much as possible to have resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP status codes to indicate API status.

We use standard HTTP which can be understood by any HTTP client, and we support [CORS](http://enable-cors.org/) to allow you to interact with our API from a client-side web application. Remember, you should never expose your secret API key in any public client-side code.

JSON is always returned from the API, including errors.

import.io uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that resulted from the provided information (e.g. a required parameter was missing), and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with our servers.

All API requests *should* be made over HTTPS to `https://api.import.io/`



## API Authentication

You authenticate to the import.io API by providing your API key as URL query string parameter `_apikey`. You can manage your API key from [your account](https://import.io/data/account/). In the My Settings page, the API in not URL encoded. To prevent a Base64 error, make sure to use a URI encode function for your query. You can also get an encoded API Key from the GET API or POST API tab in the application. Your API key allows unrestricted privileges your account, so keep it secret!

When you are logged in, *submit your password in this page header* to see the API key in the API explorer below.

## Quick Start

### Basic concepts

* import.io lets you publish dynamic APIs and Data Sets to its platform (object class `Connector`).
  * To disambiguate between dynamic API created on the platform, and static APIs such as this, we use the term `Connector` within the import.io APIs to refer to a API or Data Set published to import.io.
  * Extractors, Crawlers and Data Sets are just specializations of Connector.
* You can create these via UI tooling, or by using the APIs detailed here.
* The dynamic API definition for a Connector is versioned (object class `ConnectorVersion`); querying a connector by default queries the most recent version, whose id can be found on the `Connector` object (`latestVersionGuid`).
* Each `ConnectorVersion` has a schema (object class `Schema`) defining its input and output properties.
* All objects are accessible via the REST API.
* The output properties are returned with the query data.
  * Extra meta-data may be passed back depending on a output property [type](#data-types). 
  * All fields _may_ be multi-valued (i.e. arrays).

### Convert a URL into data

You can use import.io magic to convert a URL into data tables over our API instantly.

[Try it yourself!](?magic#!/Magic_Methods/magic)

### Query a custom API

Create an API in the UI, do a query.

[Try it yourself!](?query#!/Query_Methods/queryGet)

## Data Types

For most output property types we also return `myvar/_source` with the original textual data. 

| Type  |  Returns |  Notes | 
| ---   |  ---     |  ---   |
|   `STRING` | myvar  |  We normalize whitespace from text, and don't return empty strings | 
|  `CURRENCY` |  myvar, myvar/_currency, myvar/_source |  The ISO currency code is returned as `myvar/_currency`, the numeric value in `myvar` |  
|  `INT` |  myvar, myvar/_source | 64 bit integer (`long`) | 
|  `DOUBLE` |  myvar, myvar/_source |  64 bit float | 
|  `LANG` |  myvar, myvar/_source |  3 letter ISO code | 
|  `COUNTRY` |  myvar, myvar/_source |  3 letter ISO code | 
|  `BOOLEAN` |  myvar, myvar/_source |  true if 1, yes, on, active, true, y | 
|  `URL` |  myvar, myvar/_text, myvar/_title, myvar/_source |  `myvar/_text` is the normalized text content of the anchor | 
|  `IMAGE` |  myvar,  myvar/_alt, myvar/_title, myvar/_source |   | 
|  `HTML` |  myvar | Raw HTML as well-formed XML  | 
|  `MAP` |  myvar |  JSON compatible map | ",,,,,,,,https://d3sgt82prjfpwv.cloudfront.net/website2/271/img/import-logo-new-carmine.svg,,,,,,http://api.docs.import.io/

simplyrets.com,SimplyRETS API,"The SimplyRETS API is an exciting step towards making it easier for
developers and real estate agents to build something awesome with
real estate data!

The documentation below makes live requests to our API using the
trial data. To get set up with the API using live MLS data, you
must have RETS credentials from your MLS, which you can then use to
create an app with SimplyRETS. For more information on that
process, please see our [FAQ](https://simplyrets.com/faq), [Getting
Started](https://simplyrets.com/blog/getting-set-up.html) page, or
[contact us](https://simplyrets.com/\#home-contact).

Below you'll find the API endpoints, query parameters, response bodies,
and other information about using the SimplyRETS API. You can run
queries by clicking the 'Try it Out' button at the bottom of each
section.

### Authentication
The SimplyRETS API uses Basic Authentication. When you create an
app, you'll get a set of API credentials to access your
listings. If you're trying out the test data, you can use
`simplyrets:simplyrets` for connecting to the API.

### Media Types
The SimplyRETS API uses the 'Accept' header to allow clients to
control media types (content versions). We maintain backwards
compatibility with API clients by allowing them to specify a
content version. We highly recommend setting and explicity media
type when your application reaches production. Both the structure
and content of our API response bodies is subject to change so we
can add new features while respecting the stability of applications
which have already been developed.

To always use the latest SimplyRETS content version, simply use
`application/json` in your application `Accept` header.

If you want to pin your clients media type to a specific version,
you can use the vendor-specific SimplyRETS media type, e.g.
`application/vnd.simplyrets-v0.1+json""`

To view all valid content-types for making an `OPTIONS`, make a
request to the SimplyRETS api root

`curl -XOPTIONS -u simplyrets:simplyrets https://api.simplyrets.com/`

The default media types used in our API responses may change in the
future. If you're building an application and care about the
stability of the API, be sure to request a specific media type in the
Accept header as shown in the examples below.

The wordpress plugin automatically sets the `Accept` header for the
compatible SimplyRETS media types.

### Pagination
There a few pieces of useful information about each request stored
in the HTTP Headers:

- `X-Total-Count` shows you the total amount of listings that match
  your current query.
- `Link` contains pre-built pagination links for accessing the next
'page' of listings that match your query. Read more about that
[here](https://simplyrets.com/blog/api-pagination.html).

JSON will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors (though if you're using API bindings, we will convert the response to the appropriate language-specific object).<br><br>Contact help@statsocial.com to obtain a test API key",,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://docs.statsocial.com/home/

thetvdb.com,TheTVDB.com,"This is an early draft and targets v1 functionality with a few minor additions. The API is accessible via https://api.thetvdb.com and provides the following REST endpoints in JSON format.

How to use this API documentation
----------------

You may browse the API routes without authentication, but if you wish to send requests to the API and see response data, then you must authenticate.
1. Obtain a JWT token by `POST`ing  to the `/login` route in the `Authentication` section with your API key and credentials.
1. Paste the JWT token from the response into the ""JWT Token"" field at the top of the page and click the 'Add Token' button.

You will now be able to use the remaining routes to send requests to the API and get a response.

Language Selection
----------------

Language selection is done via the `Accept-Language` header. At the moment, you may only pass one language abbreviation in the header at a time. Valid language abbreviations can be found at the `/languages` route..

Authentication
----------------

Authentication to use the API is similar to the How-to section above. Users must `POST` to the `/login` route with their API key and credentials in order to obtain a JWT token. That token is then used in all subsequent requests by providing it in the `Authorization` header. The header will look like: `Authorization: Bearer <yourJWTtoken>`. Currently, the token expires after 1 hour. You can `GET` the `/refresh_token` route to extend that expiration date.

Versioning
----------------

You may request a different version of the API by including an `Accept` header in your request with the following format: `Accept:application/vnd.thetvdb.v$VERSION`. This documentation automatically uses the version seen at the top and bottom of the page.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
