    # Introduction
    The Rebilly API is built on HTTP.  Our API is RESTful.  It has predictable
    resource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also
    accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.  You can use your favorite
    HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Rebilly's API, or
    you can use one of our SDKs (currently available in [PHP](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-php)
    and [C#](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-dotnet-client)).

    # Authentication
    When you sign up for an account, you are given your first API key.
    You can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may
    need to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the
    Rebilly API by providing your secret key in the request header.

    Rebilly offers three forms of authentication:  private key, JSON Web Tokens, and
    public key.
    - private key: authenticates each request by searching for the presence
    of an HTTP header: REB-APIKEY.
    - JWT: authenticates each request by the HTTP header: Authorization.
    - public key: authenticates by the HTTP header: REB-AUTH (read more on this below).

    Rebilly also offers JSON Web Tokens (JWT) authentication, where you can control
    the specific granular permissions and expiration for that JWT.  We call our resource
    for generating JWT [Sessions](#tag/Sessions).

    Rebilly also has a client-side authentication scheme that uses an
    apiUser and HMAC-SHA1 signature (only for the Tokens resource), so
    that you may safely create tokens from the client-side without compromising
    your secret keys.

    Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
    The client-side authentication scheme uses one HTTP header named REB-AUTH.

    <!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->

    # PHP SDK
    For all PHP SDK examples provided in this spec you will need to configure `$client`.
    You may do it like this:

    ```php
    $client = new Rebilly\Client([
        'apiKey' => 'YourApiKeyHere',
        'baseUrl' => 'https://api.rebilly.com',
    ]);
    ```

      When you sign up for an account, you are given your first API key.
      To do so please follow this link: https://www.rebilly.com/site/signup/
      Also you can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may
      need to rotate your keys in the future).

      You can create a JSON Web Token (JWT) via our Sessions resource.
    type: basic
  RebAuth:
    description: |
      Only for the Tokens resource.
      The REB-AUTH value is created in this way
      Generate a Nonce (random string), and a Timestamp (unix timestamp)
      Concatenate the values of ApiUser, Nonce, and Timestamp (in that order).
      Use that value as the input data when you calculate the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2104">HMAC-SHA1</a> with your secret key, called the signature.
      Forming the four data points into a JSON object.

      ```json
      {
        "REB-APIUSER": "abcdefg",
        "REB-NONCE": "adfsjtreitou345fgkdafgj",
        "REB-TIMESTAMP": "1382591345",
        "REB-SIGNATURE": "a234fc95460401cfg09c9d09"
      }
      ```

      Then base64 encode that JSON object. This is the final value of the REB-AUTH HTTP header

      Always keep your API Keys private.  In addition to your API Keys, you may use

      "Don't conform to the rules. Create the rules."
      Rather than adapt your workflow and business, Rebilly can align with your business
      objectives by giving you the power to automate certain behaviors when key events happen.
      You can use this to your advantage to mitigate risk, maximize conversions and minimize costs.
      You have the controls at your fingertips here. If you need more control,
      or help dialing in on a strategy, feel free to contact us.

      When an event happens, it triggers the evaluation of conditions (that you set up),
      in order from top to bottom. If the condition is met, the corresponding actions are executed.
      The conditions continue to be checked until either all of the conditions have been executed,
      or a special "stop" action is executed.

      A File is an entity that can store a phyiscal file and some metadata. It also provides an easy access to
      its size, mime-type, user-defined tags and description thus allowing easy sorting and searching among stored
      files.
      There are several methods of file uploading available: multipart/form-data encoded form, RAW POST (by sending
      file contents as POST body), fetching from URL (by providing the file URL via 'url' param)
      Attachment is an entity that is used to link a File to one or multiple objects like Customer, Dispute, Payment,
      Transaction, Subscription, Plan, Product, Invoice, Note. That allows to quickly find and use files related to
      those specific entities.

      Collect money from your customers with payments.  You can schedule a payment
      to occur in the future.  You can assign a dunning schedule to a payment to collect
      in the case of a decline.

      Some payments may be, what we term, suspended payments.  These types of payments
      require user interaction.  For example, an initial PayPal purchase, a 3D Secure
      purchase, China Union Pay, and more require the customer's interaction to
      complete the payment.  We call these a "suspended" payment flow.
    name: Payments
  - description: |
      Payment cards are a type of payment instrument used for credit and debit card
      sales.  Rebilly securely vaults the full payment card number, and can pass it
      onward securely to any gateway account to transact business.

      Payment tokens are used to reduce the scope of PCI DSS compliance.  A payment
      token can be made using a different authentication scheme (refer to the public key
      authentication scheme in the Authentication section), which allows you to
      create a payment tokeng directly from the browser, bypassing the need to send
      sensitive cardholder info to your servers.  We recommend using this with our
      Rebilly.js library, which helps you wire a form into this API resource and create
      payment tokens.
    name: Payment Tokens
  - description: |
      Plans are a template for making a subscription.  For example, you may have a plan
      that has a 30-day free trial followed by a recurring charge of $19.95 per month
      until canceled.  The combination of the plan and a request to make a subscription
      will apply those instructions to create the invoices according to the plan's
      schedule.

      A session contains a token, which is a JSON Web Token.  The token is created
      with a user's signin credentials.

      This token can be used to authenticate to the API.  In addition, the session can be set to
      expire at a particular time, and has very granular control over permissions.
      Use the token to then authenticate for further requests to the Rebilly API.

      The token should be kept private, but could be stored on the user's browser
      client to simulate a "session."

      A Website represents the website/brand that customers interact with... You
      could think of it like a brand.  For example, Nestle owns Perrier and Purina
      and PowerBar.

      We recognize that some enterprises have more than one website (or brand).  The
      website is related to each invoice and each payment gateway account.  This feature
      would allow you to have gateway accounts that are related to multiple websites, or
      exclusive to particular websites.  And gives you more control over your business.

      Webhooks are designed to notify your systems when certain/all registered events happen in near real-time.
