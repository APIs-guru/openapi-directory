    They Said So Quotes API

     They Said So Quotes API offers a complete feature rich REST API access to its quotes platform.  This is the documentation for the world famous [quotes API](https://theysaidso.com/api).  If you are a subscriber and you are trying this from a console you can use Bearer token with your api key as the token. You can test and play with the API right here on this web page.
