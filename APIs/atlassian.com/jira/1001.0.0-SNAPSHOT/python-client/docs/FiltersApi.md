# **delete_favourite_for_filter**
> Filter delete_favourite_for_filter(id, expand=expand)

Remove filter as favorite

Removes a filter as a favorite for the user. Note that this operation only removes filters visible to the user from the user's favorites list.

Search for filters

Returns a [paginated](#pagination) list of filters. Use this operation to get:   *  specific filters, by defining `id` only.  *  filters that match all of the specified attributes. For example, all filters for a user with a particular word in their name. When multiple attributes are specified only filters matching all attributes are returned.  This operation can be accessed anonymously.  **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** None, however, only the following filters that match the query parameters are returned:   *  filters owned by the user.  *  filters shared with a group that the user is a member of.  *  filters shared with a private project that the user has *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for.  *  filters shared with a public project.  *  filters shared with the public.

# **set_favourite_for_filter**
> Filter set_favourite_for_filter(id, expand=expand)

Add a filter as a favorite for the user.  **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission to access Jira, however, the user can only favorite:   *  filters owned by the user.  *  filters shared with a group that the user is a member of.  *  filters shared with a private project that the user has *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for.  *  filters shared with a public project.  *  filters shared with the public.

### Example

* OAuth Authentication (OAuth2):
* Basic Authentication (basicAuth):

```python

from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://your-domain.atlassian.net
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://your-domain.atlassian.net"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

configuration.access_token = os.environ["ACCESS_TOKEN"]

# Configure HTTP basic authorization: basicAuth
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class

    id = 56 # int | The ID of the filter.
    expand = 'expand_example' # str | Use [expand](#expansion) to include additional information about filter in the response. This parameter accepts a comma-separated list. Expand options include:   *  `sharedUsers` Returns the users that the filter is shared with. This includes users that can browse projects that the filter is shared with. If you don't specify `sharedUsers`, then the `sharedUsers` object is returned but it doesn't list any users. The list of users returned is limited to 1000, to access additional users append `[start-index:end-index]` to the expand request.

If you don't specify `subscriptions`, the `subscriptions` object is returned but it doesn't list any subscriptions.

    try:
        # Add filter as favorite
        api_response = api_instance.set_favourite_for_filter(id, expand=expand)
        print("The response of FiltersApi->set_favourite_for_filter:\n")
