# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of CreateLabelResponseBody from a JSON string
create_label_response_body_instance = CreateLabelResponseBody.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(CreateLabelResponseBody.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
create_label_response_body_dict = create_label_response_body_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of CreateLabelResponseBody from a dict
create_label_response_body_from_dict = CreateLabelResponseBody.from_dict(create_label_response_body_dict)
