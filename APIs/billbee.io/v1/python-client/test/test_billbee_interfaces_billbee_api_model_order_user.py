    Billbee API

    Documentation of the Billbee REST API to connect a Billbee account to external aplications.  ## Endpoint  The Billbee API endpoint base url is https://api.billbee.io/api/v1   ## Activation  You have to enable the API in the settings of your Billbee account. In addition you need a Billbee API Key identifying the application you develop. To get an API key, send a mail to support@billbee.io and send us a short note about what you are building.  ## Authorization & security  Because you can access private data with the Billbee API, every request has to be sent over https and must  * Contain a valid API Key identifying the application/developer. It has to be sent as the HTTP header X-Billbee-Api-Key * Contain a valid user login with billbee username and api password in form of a basic auth HTTP header  ## Throttling  Each endpoint has a throttle of max 2 requests per second per combination of API Key and Billbee user.  When you exceed these 2 calls, the API will return a HTTP 429 status code
