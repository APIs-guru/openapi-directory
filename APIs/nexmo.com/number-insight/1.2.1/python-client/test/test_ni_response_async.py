    Number Insight API

    The Number Insight API delivers real-time intelligence about the validity, reachability and roaming status of a phone number and tells you how to format the number correctly in your application. There are three levels of Number Insight API available: [Basic, Standard and Advanced](https://developer.nexmo.com/number-insight/overview#basic-standard-and-advanced-apis). The advanced API is available asynchronously as well as synchronously.
