    Verify API

    The Verify API helps you to implement 2FA (two-factor authentication) in your applications. This is useful for:  * Protecting against spam, by preventing spammers from creating multiple accounts * Monitoring suspicious activity, by forcing an account user to verify ownership of a number * Ensuring that you can reach your users at any time because you have their correct phone number More information is available at <https://developer.nexmo.com/verify>
