        Once you've found a Plan you like, you can make a request for it. When you make a request for it, we notify the Helper who created the Plan that there's someone waiting to chat with them. And you can start chatting with them as soon as they accept the request. 

        The response to this method also contains a link you can use to automatically login to your account.

        You can call this method as a visitor or as an existing user with a valid `auth_token`. If your `auth_token` is included, we'll create the account under your existing account. Otherwise we'll create an account automatically for you and return the auth token.
