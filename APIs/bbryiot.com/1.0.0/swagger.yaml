        Retrieve a list of applications that belong to an organization ('org_id') or that have a specific API KEY ('api_key'). The calling device requires the app.read.by.org capability on the organization and app.read capability on the applications being listed. Don&#39;t provide both 'org_id' and 'api_key' parameters, otherwise you get a 400 response (bad request).

        Get the list of capabilities. This list contains the action name, the display name, and the supported targets. This list contains only system-defined capabilities and doesn&#39;t contain user-created capabilities. Since user-defined capabilities are application-specific, there is no available mechanism to discover user-defined capabilities. However, if your user-defined capabilities are granted on an entity, you can find the user-defined capabilities using the GET operation to retrieve the list of capabilities on any entity. For example, if you have an application that grants a user-defined permission, you can use the GET operation (List the capabilities for an application) and the UUID of the application to retrieve the list capabilities, which includes both system-defined and user-defined capabilities. You can use 'target_type' to determine which capabilities can be applied to a target. For example, set the 'target_type' to "file" to get the capabilities that a file entity can grant to other entities.
        No special capabilities are required to perform this operation.

        Return all the devices that are associated with the specified user. Without any additional capabilities, a user can always retrieve the list of devices that their UUID is associated with. For users to retrieve a list of devices associated with another user, they must be granted the device.read.by.user capability to perform this operation. For example, if you grant another user entity the device.read.by.user capability, the capability permits the other user to retrieve the list of devices that are associated with your UUID.
      parameters:
        - description: |
            The universally unique identifier (UUID) of the user to query devices for. If this parameter is not provided, for user-based authenticated devices, the UUID of associated user from the device is used. For device-based authenticated devices, if no UUID is specified, a 400 error is returned.

        Create a named exposing or non-exposing tag. Non-exposing tags can be granted capabilities to perform actions on other entities. When an entity is tagged with a non-exposing tag, the capabilities are transposed to the tagged entity. This transposition causes the tagged entity to be granted the same capabilities that were granted to the tag. Exposing tags work like non-exposing tags to grant capabilities on targets. In addition, exposing tags can be targets that grant capabilities to other entities. Therefore, any capabilities that were granted by an exposing tag, as well as any capabilities granted to the tag are transposed to the tagged entity. The effect of the transposition is that the tagged entity is granted the same capabilities that were granted to the tag and the tagged entity grants the same capabilities to other entities as the tag. To create a tag, the caller must have the tag.create capability.
