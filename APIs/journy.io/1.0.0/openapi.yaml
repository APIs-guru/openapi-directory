    # Introduction


    The journy.io API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.


    The API is hosted on api.journy.io.


    # Official SDKs


    Our SDKs are designed to help you interact with our APIs with less friction. They are written in several different languages and help bridge the gap between your application and journy.io APIs. They take away the need to know the exact URL and HTTP method to use for each API call among other things leaving you more time to focus on making your application.

    Your favourite programming language not included? [Let us know!](mailto:hi@journy.io)


    In the meanwhile, you can use [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) to generate a client for your programming language.


    # Authentication


    The journy.io API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [connections screen](https://system.journy.io).


    Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.


    All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.


    For every request send to the API we expect a header `X-Api-Key` to be set with the API Key.


    ## Permissions


    When creating an API Key in [the application](https://system.journy.io) you will have the choice to give permissions to an API Key (which you can change later on). These permissions restrict the API Key from different actions. When an API Key tries to perform a certain action it doesn't have the permissions for, you will receive a `401: Unauthorized` response.


    # Rate limiting


    To prevent abuse of the API we make use of a sliding-window rate limiter. Currently, every business can do up to *5000* requests *per hour*.


    In every response the headers `X-RateLimit-Limit` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining` will be set. The `X-RateLimit-Limit`-header will always contain the current limit of requests per hour. The `X-RateLimit-Remaining`-header will always contain the amount of requests you have left in the current sliding window.


    # Errors


    journy.io uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g. a required parameter was omitted). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with journy.io's servers (these are rare).


    When performing a `POST`- or `PUT`-request with a requestBody, or when including parameters, these parameters and fields will automatically be checked and validated against the API Spec. When any error occurs, you will get a response with an `errors`-field, structured as follows:


    ```json

    {
      "errors": {
        "parameters": {
          "header": {
            "headerParameterName": "Describe what's wrong with the header parameter.",
            ...
          },
          "query": {
            "queryParameterName": "Describe what's wrong with the query parameter.",
            ...
          },
          "path": {
            "pathParameterName": "Describe what's wrong with the path parameter.",
            ...
          },
        },
        "fields": {
          "fieldName": "Describe what's wrong with the fieldName.",
          "object.fieldName": "Describe what's wrong with the fieldName of the included object.",
           ...
        }
      }
    }

    ```
