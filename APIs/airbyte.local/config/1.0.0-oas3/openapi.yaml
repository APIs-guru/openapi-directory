    Airbyte Configuration API

    [https://airbyte.io](https://airbyte.io).


    This API is a collection HTTP RPC-style methods. While it is not a REST API, those familiar with REST should find the conventions of this API recognizable.


    Here are some conventions that this API follows:

    * All endpoints are http POST methods.

    * All endpoints accept data via `application/json` request bodies. The API does not accept any data via query params.

    * The naming convention for endpoints is: localhost:8001/{VERSION}/{METHOD_FAMILY}/{METHOD_NAME} e.g. `localhost:8001/v1/connections/create`.

    * For all `update` method, the whole object must be passed in, even the fields that did not change.


    Change Management:

    * The major version of the API endpoint can be determined / specified in the URL `localhost:8080/v1/connections/create`

    * Minor version bumps will be invisible to the end user. The user cannot specify minor versions in requests.

    * All backwards incompatible changes will happen in major version bumps. We will not make backwards incompatible changes in minor version bumps. Examples of non-breaking changes (includes but not limited to...):
      * Adding fields to request or response bodies.
      * Adding new HTTP endpoints.
