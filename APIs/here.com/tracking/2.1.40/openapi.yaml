      Provide a trackingId and retrieve associated aliases. Search within aliases

      for associated trackers.


      A tracker often has to be associated with an external system in a way that is

      neither part of the reported state of the device or the desired state -“ attaching

      a tracker to a particular engine part or palette; assigning a human-readable name;

      synchronizing with an external asset management system. This service allows the

      association of arbitrary type-externalId pairs with a trackingId as well as the ability to

      search across those type-externalId pairs to find the containing trackingIds. External Id

      and type pair must be unique within an account.

      This service is used to manage the associations between devices and geofences.


      HERE Tracking generates a notification when a device crosses in or out of an associated geofence.
    name: Geofence Associations
  - description: >
      Create and manage geofences.


      A geofence is a boundary that you can define and associate with your devices.

      The area that the geofence encloses can be defined using geographic coordinates or radio measurements.

      When active, HERE Tracking can notify you when a device transitions in

      or out of a geofence.


      Circle and polygon geofences are usable both outdoors and indoors. The evaluation is based on the coordinates of the trace.
    name: Geofence
  - description: >
      Provide a trackingId, geofenceId or sensorRuleId and retrieve associated metadata. Update

      meta information for your resource.


      A tracker, geofence or sensor rule often has to be associated with metadata;

      adding descriptive information about it. This service allows the

      association of arbitrary JSON object with a trackingId, geofenceId or sensorRuleId.
    name: Metadata
  - description: >
      Manage notification channels for a user.


      Users can opt to receive notifications whenever one of their devices generates an event based on

      predefined event rule threshold values. The channel supported for notifications is webhook.


      Once a user has registered a URL as a webhook, the URL will receive a POST request whenever an

      event occurs. The API version used to register the webhook URL determines the body of the

      notification.


      <h2>v2</h2>


      Notifications sent to URLs registered at v2 API contain only geofence related events. The POST

      body is a JSON object that describes the event.


      ```

      {
        "inOut": "PING_OUTSIDE_FENCE",
        "geofenceId": "e2f651ee-f196-4fa3-bf88-894dc131dea3",
        "trackingId": "HERE-871eb4c9-76f6-4e9d-bed7-fa114f793e83",
        "timestamp": 1499258184142,
        "notificationStatus": "SENT"
      }


      ```

      Possible values for `inOut` are:

       * PING_OUTSIDE_FENCE
       * PING_IN_FENCE

      <h2>v3</h2>


      Notifications sent to URLs registered at v3 API contain only events the user subscribed to when

      registering the webhook URL. The POST body is an array of JSON objects, each describing an

      event.


      ```

      ```

      Possible values for `eventType` are:

       * ABOVE_RANGE
       * IN_RANGE
       * BELOW_RANGE
       * FALSE_TO_TRUE
       * TRUE_TO_FALSE
       * EVENT

      Supported sensor types are:

       * attach
       * battery
       * humidity
       * pressure
       * tamper
       * temperature

      <h2>Offline</h2>


      If a device has been working offline and caching position updates, notifications are not sent

      until the device is online again. All events are recorded in the events log.
    name: Notifications
  - description: >
      Create and manage a sensor rule.


      A sensor rule defines the sensor alarm threshold values. You can define and associate a sensor rule with


      your devices. HERE Tracking can notify you when a device sensor data falls within or outside the predefined


      threshold values.
    name: Sensors
  - description: >
      Shadows provide an effective way to manage configurations for devices that are online intermittently.


      Shadows are stored in HERE Tracking and contain two states of a device's

      configuration: The `reported` state and the `desired` state.


      The `reported` state contains the most recent settings that the device had sent

      when it was last online. The state is meant to be read by an application.


      The `desired` state contains settings that the device should use.

      The device will read these when it is online.


      > **IMPORTANT**

      > Devices should not communicate directly with this service. Devices must send telemetry

      > to the ingestion endpoint only. This telemetry data is used to update the `reported`

      > configuration for the device.


      Ideally, applications should only write to the `desired` configuration state and

      only read from `reported` configuration state.
    name: Shadows
  - description: >
      Use this API to access current and historical data that a device has collected.

      This data includes a history of the device position, payload, and timestamp.

    name: Traces
  - description: >
      Use this API to access current and historical data about device transitions.


      A transition event is created each time a device enters or exists an associated

      geofence. These events are stored in the transition log.
    name: Transitions

        Gets all aliases on the account.


        If the request is supplied with `type` query parameter, the successful response will contain

        only aliases of the given type.


        If the request is supplied with `after` query parameter, the successful response will

        contain aliases created after the given timestamp.


        The `count` and `pageToken` parameters provide pagination for results

        where the user has large amount of aliases.


        In this case, `count` is the number of records returned per page along with

        a `pageToken` header in the returned HTTP response. The `pageToken` indicates

        the next available page in the matching result set. To get the next page of

        records, submit `pageToken` as a query parameter in your next request. Using

        `after` parameter with `pageToken` is forbidden.


        The paginated results are returned in the order of the alias creation time.

        All aliases of a trackingId may therefore not fit in the same page.

        If the request is supplied with `type` query parameter, the successful response will contain

        only aliases of the given type.


        The `count` and `pageToken` parameters provide pagination for results

        where the user has large amount of aliases.


        In this case, `count` is the number of records returned per page along with

        a `pageToken` header in the returned HTTP response. The `pageToken` indicates

        the next available page in the matching result set. To get the next page of

        records, submit `pageToken` as a query parameter in your next request.

      description: >
        Returns all events for all devices within a specific time range. The results are listed in

        descending order based on the timestamp. Each event can be identified uniquely by

        trackingId-ruleId-timestamp key.


        You define the range with `before` and `after` timestamps. A successful response contains

        an array of events that were recorded after the first timestamp and before the second.


        If the request is supplied with `eventSource` query parameter, the response will contain

        events generated by the defined source.


        If the request is supplied with `eventType` query parameter, the response will contain

        events of the specified type.


        If the request is supplied with `ruleId` query parameter, the response will contain events

        for the specified ruleId.


        The aforementioned query parameters can be combined to get the specific event types for a

        specific event source for a specific time frame.



        The `count` and `pageToken` parameters provide pagination for the results where the device

        has large amount of events. Query parameter `count` is the number of records returned

        per page. If all the matching records could not fit the page, a `pageToken` is returned in

        the response body. To get the next page of matching records, supply the request with

        `pageToken` query parameter.

              Sensors that report numerical measurement data (battery, humidity, pressure and temperature)

              report values inside or outside the rule range. Therefore the event generated by the crossing

              of the rule limits causes BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE event types.


              Sensors that report boolean data (attach, tamper) generate events when they transition from

              a state to another. When a device previously reported false but then reported true value for

              the sensor generates a FALSE_TO_TRUE event (and vice versa for the TRUE_TO_FALSE event).


              Sensors that report data when a monitored event occurs (e.g. the tracked was dropped) generate

              events of type EVENT. They are not dependent on previous values sent by the device.


              Events of type INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE are generated when the device enters or exits

              geofence associated to the device.

        Returns all events for the device within a specific time range. The results are listed in

        descending order based on the timestamp. Each event can be identified uniquely by

        trackingId-ruleId-timestamp key. A single event can be fetched using ruleId, before and

        after query parameters.


        You define the range with `before` and `after` timestamps. A successful response contains

        an array of events that were recorded after the first timestamp and before the second.


        If the request is supplied with `eventSource` query parameter, the response will contain

        events generated by the defined source.


        If the request is supplied with `eventType` query parameter, the response will contain

        events of the specified type.


        If the request is supplied with `ruleId` query parameter, the response will contain events

        for the specified ruleId.


        The aforementioned query parameters can be combined to get the specific event types for a

        specific event source for a specific time frame.


        The `count` and `pageToken` parameters provide pagination for the results where the device

        has large amount of events. Query parameter `count` is the number of records returned

        per page. If all the matching records could not fit the page, a `pageToken` is returned in

        the response body. To get the next page of matching records, supply the request with

        `pageToken` query parameter.

              Type of the event. Event types depend on the data the device sends.


              Sensors that report numerical measurement data (battery, humidity, pressure and temperature)

              report values inside or outside the rule range. Therefore the event generated by the crossing

              of the rule limits causes BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE event types.


              Sensors that report boolean data (attach, tamper) generate events when they transition from

              a state to another. When a device previously reported false but then reported true value for

              the sensor generates a FALSE_TO_TRUE event (and vice versa for the TRUE_TO_FALSE event).


              Sensors that report data when a monitored event occurs (e.g. the tracked was dropped) generate

              events of type EVENT. They are not dependent on previous values sent by the device.


              Events of type INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE are generated when the device enters or exits

              geofence associated to the device.

        You can specify a geofence as a circle, or as a polygon. You can also assign a name and a description to each geofence to help identify them.


        Circle

        ---


        Specify the coordinates of the center point of the circle and a radius in

        meters.


        ```json
            {
              "name": "Home",
              "type": "circle",
              "definition": {
                "center": {
                  "lat": 52.5308398,
                  "lng": 13.38490035
                },
                "radius": 100
              },
              "description": "Small area around my house."
            }
        ```


        Polygon

        ---


        Specify an array of points. A minimum of three points are required.


        *NOTE: If the points do not describe a closed polygon, the polygon is

        automatically closed between the last and first points.*


        ```json
            {
              "name": "Work",
              "type": "polygon",
              "definition": {
                "points": [{
                  "lat": 52.5308398,
                  "lng": 13.38490035
                }, {
                  "lat": 52.530443,
                  "lng": 13.38482003
                }, {
                  "lat": 52.5308298,
                  "lng": 13.38492235
                }]
              },
              "description": "The area around work."
            }
        ```

        Indoor geofence

        ---

        In addition to previous definition, you can also define the floor properties of the geofence

        ```json
            {
              "name": "Office indoor",
              "type": "circle",
              "definition": {
                "center": {
                  "lat": 52.5308398,
                  "lng": 13.38490035
                },
                "radius": 20,
                "floor": {
                  "level": 2,
                  "id": "DM_1234"
                  "name": "Office floor 2"
                }
              },
              "description": "Floor 2 of the office."
            }

        ```


        Successful requests have the HTTP status 201 and the response body provides

        the ID of the created geofence.

                              Type of the event. Event types depend on the data the device sends.


                              Sensors that report numerical measurement data (battery, humidity, pressure and temperature)

                              report values inside or outside the rule range. Therefore the event generated by the crossing

                              of the rule limits causes BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE event types.


                              Sensors that report boolean data (attach, tamper) generate events when they transition from

                              a state to another. When a device previously reported false but then reported true value for

                              the sensor generates a FALSE_TO_TRUE event (and vice versa for the TRUE_TO_FALSE event).


                              Sensors that report data when a monitored event occurs (e.g. the tracked was dropped) generate

                              events of type EVENT. They are not dependent on previous values sent by the device.


                              Events of type INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE are generated when the device enters or exits

                              geofence associated to the device.

                              Type of the event. Event types depend on the data the device sends.

                              Sensors that report boolean data (attach, tamper) generate events when they transition from

                              a state to another. When a device previously reported false but then reported true value for

                              the sensor generates a FALSE_TO_TRUE event (and vice versa for the TRUE_TO_FALSE event).


                              Sensors that report data when a monitored event occurs (e.g. the tracked was dropped) generate

                              events of type EVENT. They are not dependent on previous values sent by the device.


                              Events of type INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE are generated when the device enters or exits

                              geofence associated to the device.

        When a device is claimed, it will be assigned a trackingID. This is the

        identifier in HERE Tracking that the data is associated with. Having a

        separate deviceId and trackingId means that devices can have their ownership

        transferred without having to create and install a new deviceId and

        deviceSecret.


        Only users with a valid Tracking license are authorized to claim

        new devices. Claimed devices must be associated with owner

        application ID, which is used when incrementing device usage

        for billing purposes.

        Starts a batch job to create credentials for either physical devices or virtual devices. Virtual devices are meant for cloud-to-cloud use case.

        Credentials for physical devices are deviceId and deviceSecret. Batch job creates number of physical devices specified by the 'count' parameter in the request body.

        Virtual devices are identified with an external device ID and request sender's appId. The virtual device external ID is application specific and user is free to allocate it as user finds suitable. The external IDs for the virtual devices to be created are specified in the 'devices' array in request body. For virtual devices the response contains only deviceId, no deviceSecret.

        The autoclaim parameter can only be used when creating virtual devices. If autoclaim=true, the created virtual devices are immediately bound to the requesting account. In this case the response contains also external IDs and tracking IDs for the claimed devices.

        Provides shadow objects for multiple devices. You can get shadows for a

        maximum of 100 devices per request.


        By providing `after` timestamp parameter the request will return only

        those shadow objects that were modified at or after the timestamp given

        in `after`. If `after` is not supplied it defaults to 0.


        Each returned shadow object consists of these properties:


        * `body` - The data that Shadows persists for the device (included on success)

        * `statusCode` - HTTP status code of the Shadows data, 200 indicates success, other values an error

        * `trackingId` - Tracking ID of the device the data is associated with (included when `appId` is not provided)

        * `appId` - Application identifier (included when `appId` is provided)

        * `externalId` - Application specific external ID (included when `appId` is provided)

        The device shadow contains 'reported' and 'desired' configuration states

        for a device. Only 'desired' state can be updated with this end-point.

        Reported state is updated using ingestion end-point.


        Request

        ---


        The body is a shadow object with an update to `desired` configuration state.


        Response

        ---

        The response example shows the response to the previous request example

        where the `desired` state was updated.

      description: >
        Gets all traces that were recorded within the specified time range.


        Define the range with 'before' and 'after' timestamps. A successful

        response contains an array of traces that were recorded after the

        first timestamp and before the second.


        Traces are returned as an array in descending order based on timestamp.


        Note:

        ---


        To ensure a fast response, always provide both `before` and `after` timestamps.


        If no values are supplied `after` defaults to 0, and `before` defaults

        to the current system time.


        The `count` and `pageToken` parameters provide pagination for results

        where a large volume of data matches the given time range.



        In this case, `count` is the number of records returned per page along with

        a `pageToken` header in the returned HTTP response. The `pageToken` indicates

        the next available page in the matching result set. To get the next page of

        records, submit `pageToken` as a query parameter in your next request. Using the

        `pageToken` query parameter will override any additional `before` and `after` parameters.

        The default number of records per page is 1000, which is also the maximum number of

        records per page.


        In case of success, the response body contains an array of trace

        samples between the given timestamps (after <= timestamp <= before).

        Gets all transitions that were recorded within a specific time range.

        You define the range with `before` and `after` timestamps. A successful

        response contains an array of transitions that were recorded after the

        first timestamp and before the second.


        Transitions are listed in descending order based on the timestamp.


        Note:

        ---


        To ensure a fast response, always provide both `before` and `after` timestamps.


        If no values are supplied `after` defaults to 0, and `before` defaults

        to the current system time.


        The `count` and `pageToken` parameters provide pagination for results

        where a large volume of data matches the given time range.


        In this case, `count` is the number of records returned per page along with

        a `pageToken` header in the returned HTTP response. The `pageToken` indicates

        the next available page in the matching result set. To get the next page of

        records, submit `pageToken` as a query parameter in your next request. The default

        number of records per page is 100, which is also the maximum number of

        records per page.

        A device uses its access token to send data to HERE Tracking.


        If the request is set to be synchronous, the response will be

        the desired state of the device shadow. If the request is set

        to be asynchronous, the response will be empty.


        To have a position associated with a device, the request body must contain

        either a `position` or a `scan` object (see the object definitions for

        details). If both are provided, the `scan` is resolved to a `position`. The

        more accurate of the two positions (provided and resolved) is used as the

        device's position.


        If a `scan` is provided, HERE Tracking will resolve the position asynchronously

        and return the desired state. The reported shadow will then be updated

        immediately after responding.

        A device uses its access token to send data to HERE Tracking or owner sends data on behalf of a device.


        If owner ingests data on behalf of a device, the device can be either real or virtual device. Real device is identified with a tracking ID obtained from HERE Tracking. Virtual device is identified with application specific external ID and App ID which identifies the application.


        By default the request is synchronous and the response will be the desired state of the device shadow. If the request is set to be asynchronous, the response will be empty.


        To have a position associated with a device, the request body must contain either a `position` or a `scan` object (see the object definitions for details). If both are provided, the `scan` is resolved to a `position`. The more accurate of the two positions (provided and resolved) is used as the device's position.


        If a `scan` is provided, HERE Tracking will resolve the position asynchronously and return the desired state. The reported shadow will then be updated immediately after responding.

        - description: >
            ID used for correlating requests within HERE Tracking. Used for logging and error reporting.

        Single request can contain data for multiple devices. If the devices are virtual devices, they are identified with application specific external ID and App ID which identifies the application. Real devices are identified with tracking ID obtained from HERE Tracking.


        To have a position associated with a device, the request body must contain either a `position` or a `scan` object (see the object definitions for details). If both are provided, the `scan` is resolved to a `position`. The more accurate of the two positions (provided and resolved) is used as the device's position.

            report values inside or outside the rule range. Therefore the event generated by the crossing

            Sensors that report boolean data (attach, tamper) generate events when they transition from

            a state to another. When a device previously reported false but then reported true value for

            the sensor generates a FALSE_TO_TRUE event (and vice versa for the TRUE_TO_FALSE event).


            Sensors that report data when a monitored event occurs (e.g. the tracked was dropped) generate

            events of type EVENT. They are not dependent on previous values sent by the device.

                          Sensors that report numerical measurement data (battery, humidity, pressure and temperature)

                          of the rule limits causes BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE event types.


                          Sensors that report boolean data (attach, tamper) generate events when they transition from

                          a state to another. When a device previously reported false but then reported true value for

                          the sensor generates a FALSE_TO_TRUE event (and vice versa for the TRUE_TO_FALSE event).


                          Sensors that report data when a monitored event occurs (e.g. the tracked was dropped) generate

                          events of type EVENT. They are not dependent on previous values sent by the device.


                          Events of type INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE are generated when the device enters or exits

                          geofence associated to the device.

        HERE Tracking requires that you sign your requests for tokens. The signature method uses the OAuth 1.0 standard. For more information on this standard, see the [OAuth Core 1.0](https://oauth.net/core/1.0/) specification.


        > **Note:** You must create a new signature for each token request to HERE Tracking. Signatures can only be used once.


        Create the Signature Base String

        ---


        The first step in creating a signature is to create the signature base string. This string contains the parameters to use when generating the signature.


        *1. To begin, make sure you have the information listed in the following table.*


        | Parameter                | Description                              |

        | ------------------------ | -----------------------------------------|

        | oauth\_consumer\_key     | The device ID for which you want to generate a token. |

        | oauth\_signature\_method | Always use "HMAC-SHA256".                 |

        | oauth\_timestamp         | The number of seconds since the Unix epoch at the point the request is generated. This must be within 10 seconds of the timestamp returned by the `/v2/timestamp` endpoint. |

        | oauth\_nonce             | A unique string for this signature. The string cannot have been used in a previous signature. Each token generation request to HERE Tracking must have a unique signature, and the value in this parameter is what is used to ensure the signature is unique. |

        | oauth\_version           | Always use "1.0".                         |


        *2. Combine these values into a single string by following these steps:*

           1. URL encode every key and value.
           2. Sort the list of key-value pairs alphabetically by key.
           3. Concatenate each key/value pair, separating each with an ampersand character ("&").

        The result is a parameter string that looks like this (line breaks are added for legibility):

           ```
           oauth_consumer_key=47164fb0-b7b3-49e8-891b-650270b82cf2
           &oauth_nonce=LIIpk4
           &oauth_signature_method=HMAC-SHA256
           &oauth_timestamp=1513634609
           &oauth_version=1.0
           ```

        *3. Combine the HTTP method, base URL, and parameter string into a single string called the "base string". This will be the string from which the signature is generated. The base string is in this format:*

           ```
           POST&https://tracking.api.here.com/v2/token&<URL encoded parameter string>
           ```

           The base string consists of:

           1. The HTTP method in caps (POST) followed by an ampersand ("&")
           2. The URL of the HERE Tracking token endpoint followed by an ampersand ("&")
           3. The URL-encoded parameter string.

           For example (line breaks are added for legibility):

           ```
           POST
            &https%3A%2F%2Ftracking.api.here.com%2Fv2%2Ftoken
            &oauth_consumer_key%3D47164fb0-b7b3-49e8-891b-650270b82cf2%26
            oauth_nonce%3DLIIpk4%26oauth_signature_method%3DHMAC-SHA256%26
            oauth_timestamp%3D1513634609%26oauth_version%3D1.0
           ```

           > **Note:** The URL-encoded base string should contain exactly two ampersands ("&").

        Create the signature

        ---


        The signing key used to sign the base string is the `deviceSecret` followed by an ampersand ("&").


        Create the signature by passing the signature base string and the signing key to the `HMAC-SHA256` hashing algorithm and converting the result to a `base64` string. Then, use the signature to request a token.


        Request the token

        ---


        Make a `POST` request to this endpoint with an `Authorization` header constructed from the above parameters and the generated signature.


        Example:


        ```
            Authorization: OAuth oauth_consumer_key="47164fb0-b7b3-49e8-891b-650270b82cf2",
                oauth_signature_method="HMAC-SHA256",
                oauth_timestamp="1513634609",
                oauth_nonce="LIIpk4",
                oauth_version="1.0",
                oauth_signature="pQ9EJX14L736B%2Br7uZl4yQlO6Xw%3D"
        ```
      in: header
      name: Authorization
      type: apiKey
