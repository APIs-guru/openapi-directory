**max_frame_rate** | **float** | The maximum frame rate available for the track. Only set for the &#x60;video&#x60; type track. This field may return &#x60;-1&#x60; if the frame rate of the input cannot be reliably determined. | [optional]

**name** | **str** | The name of the track containing a human-readable description. The HLS manifest will associate a subtitle &#x60;text&#x60; or &#x60;audio&#x60; track with this value. For example, the value should be \&quot;English\&quot; for a subtitle text track for the &#x60;language_code&#x60; value of &#x60;en-US&#x60;. This parameter is only set for &#x60;text&#x60; and &#x60;audio&#x60; track types. | [optional]

Valid &#x60;text_source&#x60; values are listed below. * &#x60;uploaded&#x60;: Tracks uploaded to Mux as caption or subtitle files using the Create Asset Track API. * &#x60;embedded&#x60;: Tracks extracted from an embedded stream of CEA-608 closed captions. * &#x60;generated_vod&#x60;: Tracks generated by automatic speech recognition on an on-demand asset. * &#x60;generated_live&#x60;: Tracks generated by automatic speech recognition on a live stream configured with &#x60;generated_subtitles&#x60;. If an Asset has both &#x60;generated_live&#x60; and &#x60;generated_live_final&#x60; tracks that are &#x60;ready&#x60;, then only the &#x60;generated_live_final&#x60; track will be included during playback. * &#x60;generated_live_final&#x60;: Tracks generated by automatic speech recognition on a live stream using &#x60;generated_subtitles&#x60;. The accuracy, timing, and formatting of these subtitles is improved compared to the corresponding &#x60;generated_live&#x60; tracks. However, &#x60;generated_live_final&#x60; tracks will not be available in &#x60;ready&#x60; status until the live stream ends. If an Asset has both &#x60;generated_live&#x60; and &#x60;generated_live_final&#x60; tracks that are &#x60;ready&#x60;, then only the &#x60;generated_live_final&#x60; track will be included during playback.  | [optional]

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.track import Track

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Track from a JSON string
track_instance = Track.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(Track.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
track_dict = track_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Track from a dict
track_from_dict = Track.from_dict(track_dict)
