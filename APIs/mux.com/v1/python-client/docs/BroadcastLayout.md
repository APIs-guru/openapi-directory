# BroadcastLayout

The layout used when broadcasting the space.  The `gallery` layout will show participants in a grid that automatically resizes each participantâ€™s stream to best fit up to 10 participants in the window. The `active-speaker` layout will show only the current active speaker, without a border. The `crop` layout uses as much of the available space as possible to show the participant's stream.  Defaults to `gallery` if not set. 

## Enum

* `GALLERY` (value: `'gallery'`)

* `ACTIVE_MINUS_SPEAKER` (value: `'active-speaker'`)

* `CROP` (value: `'crop'`)
