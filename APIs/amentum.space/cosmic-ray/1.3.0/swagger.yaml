  description: >
    High energy galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and bursts of solar energetic particles (SEP)  collide with gases in the atmosphere, leading to a cascade of nuclear and electromagnetic reactions.  The result is a complex mix of ionising radiation, the intensity  and composition of which varies spatially and temporally. Understanding this mix is important for a variety of applications, including estimating  the radiation exposure of aircrew, pilots, and frequent flyers during air travel. <br><br>

    The PARMA model, developed by the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA), can instantaneously estimate cosmic ray fluxes of neutrons, protons, ions, muons, electrons, positrons, and photons for a given date, latitude, longitude, and altitude. A comprehensive description of PARMA can be found in the publications <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0160390">here</a> and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0144679">here</a>.<br><br>

    The Terms and Conditions of PARMA are described  <a href="http://phits.jaea.go.jp/expacs/index.html">here</a>. Use of the API  acknowledges you have read and agreed to those Terms and Conditions.<br><br>

    We provide access to the PARMA model via an easy-to-use web API. Solar energetic particle effects  are not modelled by PARMA.

    The API is rate limited to 10,000 calls per month and for non commercial use.  Contact <a href="mailto:team@amentum.space">team@amentum.space</a> to  discuss commercial use.<br><br>

    get:
      description: >
        The ambient dose equivalent, H*(10), is an operational quantity that simulates the  human body by measuring the dose equivalent at a depth of 10 mm within a tissue  equivalent sphere of 300 mm diameter. It is a measurable quantity that is  used to calibrate area monitors (radiation detectors) for mixed radiation fields.
