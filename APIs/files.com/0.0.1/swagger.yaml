      Automations allow you to automate workflows on your Files.com site.


      Automations are different from Behaviors because Behaviors are associated with a current folder, while Automations apply across your entire site.

      Although Automations may have a Path specified, it can be a glob (which includes wildcards), which affects multiple folders.

      Additionally, paths in Automations can refer to folders which don't yet exist.


      Automations are never removed when folders are removed, while Behaviors are removed when the associated folder is removed.



      ## Automation Types


      There are currently three types of automations:  Create Folder, Request File, and Request Move.



      ### Create Folder Automation


      The Create Folder automation creates folders on a schedule.


      Example Use case:  Our business files sales tax for each division in 11 states every quarter.

      I want to create the folders where those sales tax forms and data will be collected.


      I could create a Create Folder automation as follows:


      * Interval: `quarter_end`

      * Path: `/AccountingAndTax/SalesTax/State/*/`

      * Destination: `%Y/Quarter-ending-%m-%d`



      ### Request File Automation


      The Request File automation requests a file (optionally from a specific user) if it does not exist.


      Example Use case: Continuing our Sales Tax example from above, once the folders are

      created for the 11 states, our Bookkeeper needs to upload a `.xlsx` file

      containing the sales records for each state.


      We can create a Request File automation as follows:


      * Path: `/AccountingAndTax/SalesTax/State/*/*/*/`

      * Destination: `SalesByState-%p3-%p2-%p1`

      * Group IDs: `123` (representing the Bookkeepers group)


      Note that the %p1, %p2 amd %p3 are references back into the folder hierarchy

      (parent 1, parent 2, etc), so that the file will be named with the state

      name and the quarter name in the file.  Example: `SalesByState-NV-2017-Quarter-ending-Dec-31.xlsx`


      Now, let's say that our Tax Accountant is in charge of filing the actual

      state tax return once the Excel doc is completed by the Bookkeeper.  We

      can create another Automation to let him know when it's his turn

      to operate:


      * Path: `/AccountingAndTax/SalesTax/State/*/*/%/`

      * Source: `SalesByState-%p3-%p2-%p1`

      * Destination: `StateSalesTaxReturn-Unsigned-%p3-%p2-%p1`

      * Group IDs: `124` (representing the Tax Accountants group)
          Group: Tax Accountants

      So the accountant will take the excel from the bookkeeper, generate the

      state tax return, and then upload it as a PDF, ready for the CFO to

      sign.  How does the CFO know when to sign?  You guessed it, another

      Automation will let him know when it's ready:


      * Path: `/AccountingAndTax/**/`

      * Source: `*-Unsigned-*`

      * Destination Replace From: `-Unsigned-`

      * Destination Replace To: `-Signed-`

      * Group IDs: `125` (representing the CFO group)


      This Automation looks in every nested subfolder of `AcccountingAndTax`

      (that's the `/**/` in the path).  And it looks for any filename containing

      the filename string `-Unsigned-`.  That's the cue to the CFO that something needs his

      signature.


      Rather than specifying the exact destination filename, we can specify a Destination Replace From

      and To in order to generate the new filename from the old filename.


      So if `StateSalesTaxReturn-Unsigned-NV-2017-q4.pdf` is uploaded, this

      Automation will trigger and expect the file `StateSalesTaxReturn-Signed-NV-2017-q4.pdf`

      from the CFO.


      You could then put in place another rule for the Tax Accountant or

      Bookkeeper to go do the actual filing once a signature is in place.



      ### Request Move Automation


      The Request Move automation requests that a file be moved.  This is an alternate way to implement approval workflows.


      A variant of the Request File automation, this Automation creates requests that a

      user or group move a file, presumably indicating that they've taken some action on it.


      Example Use case: Action Verb uses Files.com to collect invoices from its Contractors, who

      upload new invoices into their own folder structure that only they have

      permissions to.  That structure looks like this:


      * `/Accounts Payable/Contractors/[contractor]/New/`

      * `/Accounts Payable/Contractors/[contractor]/Paid/`


      The contractor has full permissions to the `New/` folder, but only

      read-only permissions to `Paid/`.  This allows them to upload and update

      new invoices, but only view invoices that are already paid.  (Cool!)


      But, as we grow to dozens of contractors, it becomes a tough task for

      Accounts Payable to check all the New folders daily.


      To ensure Contractors get paid timely, we might set up Request Move automation:


      * Path: `/AccountsPayable/Contractors/*/New/`

      * Source: `*`

      * Destination: `../Paid/`

      * Group IDs: `126` (representing the Accounts Payable group)

      Behaviors are the API resource for what are also known as Folder Settings.  Every behavior is associated with a folder.


      Depending on the behavior, it may also operate on child folders.  It may be overridable at the child folder level or maybe can be added to at the child folder level.  The exact options for each behavior type are explained in the table below.


      Additionally, some behaviors are visible to non-admins, and others are even settable by non-admins.  All the details are below.


      Each behavior uses a different format for storings its settings value.  Next to each behavior type is an example value.  Our API and SDKs currently require that the value for behaviors be sent as raw JSON within the `value` field.  Our SDK generator and API documentation generator doesn't fully keep up with this requirement, so if you need any help finding the exact syntax to use for your language or use case, just reach out.

      Groups are a powerful tool for permissions and user management on Files.com.  Users can belong to multiple groups.


      All permissions can be managed via Groups, and Groups can also be synced to your identity platform via LDAP or SCIM.


      Files.com's Group Admin feature allows you to define Group Admins, who then have access to add and remove users within their groups.

      The History Export resource on the API is used to export historical action (history) logs.  We store recent

      action logs in a separate location from archived logs.  This API is used to query historical logs that

      aren't available in the regular History API because they've aged out.


      All queries against the archive must be submitted as Exports.  (Even our Web UI creates an Export behind

      the scenes.)


      Actions that are less than 24 hours old may not be available in this API.  (But, they may also be made available

      earlier on a best-effort basis.)  Thus, if you want to see all history for a given file or folder, you should

      query both this API and the "live" History API.


      That's exactly what our Web UI does.


      The best practice that we follow and recommend when doing a query against both APIs is to use a value of yesterday's

      midnight Eastern time as the `end_at` for queries against the HistoryExport API and as the `start_at` for

      queries against the History API. This ensures that you retrieve all entries, with no overlap.


      We use Amazon Athena behind the scenes for processing these queries, and as such, have powerful

      search capabilities.  We've done our best to expose search capabilities via this History Export API.


      In any query field in this API, you may specify multiple values separated by commas.  That means that commas

      cannot be searched for themselves, and neither can single quotation marks.


      We do not currently partition data by date on the backend, so all queries result in a full scan of the entire

      data lake.  This means that all queries will take about the same amount of time to complete, and we incur about

      the same cost per query internally.  We don't typically bill our customers for these queries, assuming

      usage is occasional and manual.


      If you intend to use this API for high volume or automated use, please contact us with more information

      about your use case.  We may decide to change the backend data schema to match your use case more closely, and

      we may also need to charge an additional cost per query.

      Remote servers are used with the `remote_server_sync` Behavior.


      Remote Servers can be either an FTP server, SFTP server, S3 bucket, Google Cloud Storage, Wasabi, Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage, or WebDAV.

      Other remote server types, such as Box, Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, and Azure Blob Storage, are coming soon.


      Not every attribute will apply to every remote server.


      FTP Servers require that you specify their `hostname`, `port`, `username`, `password`, and a value for `ssl`.  Optionally, provide `server_certificate`.


      SFTP Servers require that you specify their `hostname`, `port`, `username`, `password` or `private_key`, and a value for `ssl`.  Optionally, provide `server_certificate`.


      S3 Buckets require that you specify their `s3_bucket` name, and `s3_region`.  Optionally provide a `aws_access_key`, and `aws_secret_key`.  If you don't provide credentials, you will need to use AWS to grant us access to your bucket.


      Google Cloud Storage requires that you specify `google_cloud_storage_bucket`, `google_cloud_storage_project_id`, and `google_cloud_storage_credentials_json`.


      Wasabi requires `wasabi_bucket`, `wasabi_region`, `wasabi_access_key`, and `wasabi_secret_key`.


      Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage `backblaze_b2_bucket`, `backblaze_b2_s3_endpoint`, `backblaze_b2_application_key`, and `backblaze_b2_key_id`. (Requires S3 Compatible API) See https://help.backblaze.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047425453


      WebDAV Servers require that you specify their `hostname`, `username`, and `password`.

x-behaviors:
  - behavior: webhook
    children_can_add: true
    children_can_override: false
    docs: >
      Sends an HTTP(S) request to a remote server whenever certain actions occur on a folder.

      Webhooks are often used to integrate Files.com with other services.


      > Example Value


      ```json

      <%=JSON.pretty_generate({
        'urls' => ['https://mysite.com/url...'],
        'method' => 'POST',
        'encoding' => 'RAW',
        'triggers' => [ 'create', 'read', 'update', 'destroy', 'move', 'copy' ]
      })%>

      ```


      Value Hash Parameters | &nbsp;

      --- | ---

      `urls` | Array of URLs to send the webhook to.

      `method` | Default: `GET`.  May also be set to `POST`.

      `triggers` | Leave blank to send webhooks on any action on this folder.  Or, for specific actions, you may specify an array of action types.  Valid values are: `create`, `read`, `update`, `destroy`, `move`, `copy`.

      `encoding` | May be `JSON`, `XML`, or `RAW`.  If set to `RAW` or left blank, we will deliver the webhook using the HTTP GET params or POST body.  If JSON or XML, we will encode the payload accordingly and send a matching `Content-Type` header.
    requires_attachment: false
    unique_per_folder: false
    visible_to_non_admins: false
  - behavior: file_expiration
    children_can_add: false
    children_can_override: true
    docs: >
      Files in this folder will expire (be deleted) after a certain number of days.  This is most often used for compliance purposes where different types of data may need different retention settings.  It's also great for managing your costs.  You can retain different data for less time than others.


      Value is stored as an Integer (not a hash/array) representing the number of days.


      > Example Value


      ```json

      <%=JSON.pretty_generate(30)%>

      ```
    requires_attachment: false
    unique_per_folder: true
    visible_to_non_admins: true
  - behavior: auto_encrypt
    children_can_add: false
    children_can_override: true
    docs: >
      Files will be automatically encrypted after uploading using your provided GPG key.


      This Behavior is often used on our HIPAA accounts to convert data into a format unreadable by even us.

      GPG is an asymmetric encryption type (which means it uses public keys and private keys).

      Because you are only providing us your public key and keeping your private key, we won't be able to read anything once it has been GPG encrypted.


      > Example Value


      ```json

      <%=JSON.pretty_generate({
        'algorithm' => 'PGP/GPG',
        'suffix' => '.gpg',
        'key' => '[your GPG public key]'
      })%>

      ```


      Value Hash Parameters | &nbsp;

      --- | ---

      `algorithm` | Must be set to `PGP/GPG`.  If we support other options in the future (like OpenSSL), we will amend this option.

      `suffix` | Suffix to apply to filenames once they've been uploaded.

      `key` | Your GPG public key.  Please be sure not to send your private key here. If that happens, we try to detect it and disable the behavior for your security.
    requires_attachment: false
    unique_per_folder: true
    visible_to_non_admins: true
  - behavior: lock_subfolders
    children_can_add: false
    children_can_override: false
    docs: >
      The subfolder structure of this folder may not be changed.

      This is useful in conjunction with workflows and automations to ensure your folder structure stays as you expect.


      This behavior does not require that a `value` be set.
    requires_attachment: false
    unique_per_folder: true
    visible_to_non_admins: true
  - behavior: storage_region
    children_can_add: false
    children_can_override: true
    docs: >-
      Files in this folder are stored in a certain geographical region.

      If you set this Behavior on an existing folder, we will migrate existing files to the new location automatically.


      > Example Value


      ```json

      <%=JSON.pretty_generate('us-east-1')%>

      ```


      Value is stored as a String.  Valid region values:


      Value String | Region Description

      --- | ---

      `us-east-1` | USA, Virginia

      `ap-southeast-2` | Australia, Sydney

      `ca-central-1` | Canada, Toronto

      `eu-west-2` | EU - UK, London

      `eu-central-1` | EU - Germany, Frankfurt

      `ap-northeast-1` | Japan, Tokyo

      `ap-southeast-1` | Singapore
    requires_attachment: false
    unique_per_folder: true
    visible_to_non_admins: true
  - behavior: serve_publicly
    children_can_add: true
    children_can_override: false
    docs: >
      Files in this folder are served via a public HTTPS URL at `https://SUBDOMAIN.hosted-by-files.com/...`


      This feature works with common static site generators such as Jekyll and Middleman, and allows any static web assets or website to be hosted.

      It's a great way to get extra mileage out of your Files.com account and avoid having to pay for separate web hosting.


      > Example Value


      ```json

      <%=JSON.pretty_generate({
        'key' => 'public-photos',
        'show_index' => true
      })%>

      ```


      Value Hash Parameters | &nbsp;

      --- | ---

    unique_per_folder: true
    visible_to_non_admins: true
  - behavior: create_user_folders
    children_can_add: true
    children_can_override: false
    docs: >
      Create a folder here for new users when they are added.

      This Behavior is typically used to implement home folders for users.

      It's also a good building block for more advanced automations and workflows.


      > Example Value


      ```json

      <%=JSON.pretty_generate({
        'permission' => 'full',
        'existing_users' => true,
        'group_id' => 1
      })%>

      ```


      Value Hash Parameters | &nbsp;

      --- | ---

      `permission` | What permission level to give the user on his or her new folder?  Takes the same options as the Permissions endpoint.

      `existing_users` | Apply this behavior to existing users or only newly added users?

      `group_id` | Only apply this behavior to users who are members of this group ID.

    visible_to_non_admins: false
  - behavior: inbox
    children_can_add: true
    children_can_override: false
    docs: >
      This folder operates as an inbox where anonymous users can upload files without logging in.


      > Example Value


      ```json

      <%=JSON.pretty_generate({
        'key' => 'application-forms',
        'title' => 'Submit Your Job Applications Here',
        'description' => 'Thanks for coming to the Files.com Job Application Page',

      --- | ---

      `key` | URL key used for the inbox.

      `dont_separate_submissions_by_folder` | Do not create subfolders for files uploaded to this inbox. Note: there are subtle security pitfalls with allowing anonymous uploads from multiple users to live in the same folder.  We strongly discourage use of this option unless absolutely required.
