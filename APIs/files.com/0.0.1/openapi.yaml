        All File and Login actions on Files.com are recorded and can be queried via our History API.


        This set of endpoints only provides access to recent actions (actions created within 24 hours).  In most cases,

        you would be better served to create a Webhook, which sends actions to your server, rather than poll this endpoint.


        The HistoryExport set of endpoints provides a richer ability to query and filter, as well as search the entire

        lifetime of your history log.

        Automations allow you to automate workflows on your Files.com site.


        Automations are different from Behaviors because Behaviors are associated with a current folder, while Automations apply across your entire site.

        Although Automations may have a Path specified, it can be a glob (which includes wildcards), which affects multiple folders.

        Additionally, paths in Automations can refer to folders which don't yet exist.


        Automations are never removed when folders are removed, while Behaviors are removed when the associated folder is removed.


        ## Automation Triggers

        Automations can be triggered in the following ways:

        * `custom_schedule` : The automation will run according to the custom schedule parameters for `days_of_week` (0-based) and `times_of_day`. A time zone may be specified via `time_zone` in Rails TimeZone name format.

        * `daily` : The automation will run once each day

        * `realtime` : The automation will run any time a local file (not stored in a remote mount folder) is created, updated, or deleted.

        * `webhook` : the automation will run when a request is sent to the corresponding webhook URL.

        * `action` : The automation will run when a specific action happens, e.g. a file is created, deleted, or downloaded.


        Future enhancements will allow Automations to be triggered by an incoming email, or by other services.


        Currently, all Automation types support all triggers, with the following exceptions: The `realtime` trigger is only supported by the `Request File` and `Request Move` Automations.

        We plan to add support for this trigger to all Automation types. If you have a use case for the

        `realtime` trigger on an Automation that's not currently supported, please contact us and tell us more about your situation.



        ## Automation Types


        There are currently five types of automations:  Create Folder, Copy File, Delete File, Request File, and Request Move.



        ### Create Folder


        Creates the folder with named by `destination` in the path named by `path`.

        Destination may include formatting parameters to insert the date/time into the destination name.


        Example Use case:  Our business files sales tax for each division in 11 states every quarter.

        I want to create the folders where those sales tax forms and data will be collected.


        I could create a Create Folder automation as follows:


        * Trigger: `daily`

        * Interval: `quarter_end`

        * Path: `/AccountingAndTax/SalesTax/State/*/`

        * Destination: `%Y/Quarter-ending-%m-%d`



        ### Delete File


        Deletes the file with path matching `source` (wildcards allowed) in the path named by `path`.



        ### Copy File


        Copies files in the folder named by `path` to the path specified in `destination`.

        If the parameter `source` exists, the automation will only fire on files matching the source (wildcards allowed).

        If the parameter `limit` exists, the automation will only copy the newest `limit` files.



        ### Request File


        The Request File automation requests a file (optionally from a specific user) if it does not exist.


        It requests the file named in the parameter `destination` in the path named by the parameter `path`.

        If the parameter `source` exists, the automation will only fire if a file in that path exists.

        Destination may include formatting parameters that are backreferences to the path.


        Example Use case: Continuing our Sales Tax example from above, once the folders are

        created for the 11 states, our Bookkeeper needs to upload a `.xlsx` file

        containing the sales records for each state.


        We can create a Request File automation as follows:


        * Trigger: `realtime`

        * Path: `/AccountingAndTax/SalesTax/State/*/*/*/`

        * Destination: `SalesByState-%p3-%p2-%p1`

        * Group IDs: `123` (representing the Bookkeepers group)


        Note that the %p1, %p2 amd %p3 are references back into the folder hierarchy

        (parent 1, parent 2, etc), so that the file will be named with the state

        name and the quarter name in the file.  Example: `SalesByState-NV-2017-Quarter-ending-Dec-31.xlsx`


        Now, let's say that our Tax Accountant is in charge of filing the actual

        state tax return once the Excel doc is completed by the Bookkeeper.  We

        can create another Automation to let him know when it's his turn

        to operate:


        * Trigger: `realtime`

        * Path: `/AccountingAndTax/SalesTax/State/*/*/%/`

        * Source: `SalesByState-%p3-%p2-%p1`

        * Destination: `StateSalesTaxReturn-Unsigned-%p3-%p2-%p1`

        * Group IDs: `124` (representing the Tax Accountants group)
            Group: Tax Accountants

        So the accountant will take the excel from the bookkeeper, generate the

        state tax return, and then upload it as a PDF, ready for the CFO to

        sign.  How does the CFO know when to sign?  You guessed it, another

        Automation will let him know when it's ready:


        * Trigger: `realtime`

        * Path: `/AccountingAndTax/**/`

        * Source: `*-Unsigned-*`

        * Destination Replace From: `-Unsigned-`

        * Destination Replace To: `-Signed-`

        * Group IDs: `125` (representing the CFO group)


        This Automation looks in every nested subfolder of `AcccountingAndTax`

        (that's the `/**/` in the path).  And it looks for any filename containing

        the filename string `-Unsigned-`.  That's the cue to the CFO that something needs his

        signature.


        Rather than specifying the exact destination filename, we can specify a Destination Replace From

        and To in order to generate the new filename from the old filename.


        So if `StateSalesTaxReturn-Unsigned-NV-2017-q4.pdf` is uploaded, this

        Automation will trigger and expect the file `StateSalesTaxReturn-Signed-NV-2017-q4.pdf`

        from the CFO.


        You could then put in place another rule for the Tax Accountant or

        Bookkeeper to go do the actual filing once a signature is in place.



        ### Request Move


        The Request Move automation requests that a file be moved.  This is an alternate way to implement approval workflows.


        A variant of the Request File automation, this Automation creates requests that a

        user or group move a file, presumably indicating that they've taken some action on it.


        Example Use case: Action Verb uses Files.com to collect invoices from its Contractors, who

        upload new invoices into their own folder structure that only they have

        permissions to.  That structure looks like this:


        * `/Accounts Payable/Contractors/[contractor]/New/`

        * `/Accounts Payable/Contractors/[contractor]/Paid/`


        The contractor has full permissions to the `New/` folder, but only

        read-only permissions to `Paid/`.  This allows them to upload and update

        new invoices, but only view invoices that are already paid.  (Cool!)


        But, as we grow to dozens of contractors, it becomes a tough task for

        Accounts Payable to check all the New folders daily.


        To ensure Contractors get paid timely, we might set up Request Move automation:


        * Trigger: `realtime`

        * Path: `/AccountsPayable/Contractors/*/New/`

        Behaviors are the API resource for what are also known as Folder Settings.  Every behavior is associated with a folder.


        Depending on the behavior, it may also operate on child folders.  It may be overridable at the child folder level or maybe can be added to at the child folder level.  The exact options for each behavior type are explained in the table below.


        Additionally, some behaviors are visible to non-admins, and others are even settable by non-admins.  All the details are below.


        Each behavior uses a different format for storings its settings value.  Next to each behavior type is an example value.  Our API and SDKs currently require that the value for behaviors be sent as raw JSON within the `value` field.  Our SDK generator and API documentation generator doesn't fully keep up with this requirement, so if you need any help finding the exact syntax to use for your language or use case, just reach out.

        Form Field Sets define a custom forms to be used for bundle and inbox registrations.


        Each Form Field Set contains one or more Form Fields. A form and all of its form fields are submitted in a single create request. The order of form fields in the array is the order they will be displayed.


        Once created, a form field set can then be associated with one or more bundle(s) and/or inbox(s). Once associated, you will be required to submit well-formatted form-data when creating a bundle-registration or inbox registration.

        Groups are a powerful tool for permissions and user management on Files.com.  Users can belong to multiple groups.


        All permissions can be managed via Groups, and Groups can also be synced to your identity platform via LDAP or SCIM.


        Files.com's Group Admin feature allows you to define Group Admins, who then have access to add and remove users within their groups.

        The History Export resource on the API is used to export historical action (history) logs.  We store recent

        action logs in a separate location from archived logs.  This API is used to query historical logs that

        aren't available in the regular History API because they've aged out.


        All queries against the archive must be submitted as Exports.  (Even our Web UI creates an Export behind

        the scenes.)


        Actions that are less than 24 hours old may not be available in this API.  (But, they may also be made available

        earlier on a best-effort basis.)  Thus, if you want to see all history for a given file or folder, you should

        query both this API and the "live" History API.


        That's exactly what our Web UI does.


        The best practice that we follow and recommend when doing a query against both APIs is to use a value of yesterday's

        midnight Eastern time as the `end_at` for queries against the HistoryExport API and as the `start_at` for

        queries against the History API. This ensures that you retrieve all entries, with no overlap.


        We use Amazon Athena behind the scenes for processing these queries, and as such, have powerful

        search capabilities.  We've done our best to expose search capabilities via this History Export API.


        In any query field in this API, you may specify multiple values separated by commas.  That means that commas

        cannot be searched for themselves, and neither can single quotation marks.


        We do not currently partition data by date on the backend, so all queries result in a full scan of the entire

        data lake.  This means that all queries will take about the same amount of time to complete, and we incur about

        the same cost per query internally.  We don't typically bill our customers for these queries, assuming

        usage is occasional and manual.


        If you intend to use this API for high volume or automated use, please contact us with more information

        about your use case.  We may decide to change the backend data schema to match your use case more closely, and

        we may also need to charge an additional cost per query.

        Remote servers are used with the `remote_server_sync` Behavior.


        Remote Servers can be either an FTP server, SFTP server, S3 bucket, Google Cloud Storage, Wasabi, Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage, Rackspace Cloud Files container, WebDAV, Box, Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, or Azure Blob Storage.


        Not every attribute will apply to every remote server.


        FTP Servers require that you specify their `hostname`, `port`, `username`, `password`, and a value for `ssl`.  Optionally, provide `server_certificate`.


        SFTP Servers require that you specify their `hostname`, `port`, `username`, `password` or `private_key`, and a value for `ssl`.  Optionally, provide `server_certificate`.


        S3 Buckets require that you specify their `s3_bucket` name, and `s3_region`.  Optionally provide a `aws_access_key`, and `aws_secret_key`.  If you don't provide credentials, you will need to use AWS to grant us access to your bucket.


        Google Cloud Storage requires that you specify `google_cloud_storage_bucket`, `google_cloud_storage_project_id`, and `google_cloud_storage_credentials_json`.


        Wasabi requires `wasabi_bucket`, `wasabi_region`, `wasabi_access_key`, and `wasabi_secret_key`.


        Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage `backblaze_b2_bucket`, `backblaze_b2_s3_endpoint`, `backblaze_b2_application_key`, and `backblaze_b2_key_id`. (Requires S3 Compatible API) See https://help.backblaze.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047425453


        Rackspace Cloud Files requires `rackspace_username`, `rackspace_api_key`, `rackspace_region`, and `rackspace_container`.


        WebDAV Servers require that you specify their `hostname`, `username`, and `password`.


        OneDrive follow the `auth_setup_link` and login with Microsoft.


        Box follow the `auth_setup_link` and login with Box.


        Dropbox follow the `auth_setup_link` and login with Dropbox.


        Google Drive follow the `auth_setup_link` and login with Google.

    children_can_add: true
    children_can_override: false
    docs: >
      Sends an HTTP(S) request to a remote server whenever certain actions occur on a folder.

      Webhooks are often used to integrate Files.com with other services.


      > Example Value


      ```json

      <%=JSON.pretty_generate({
        'urls' => ['https://mysite.com/url...'],
        'method' => 'POST',
        'encoding' => 'RAW',
        'triggers' => [ 'create', 'read', 'update', 'destroy', 'move', 'copy' ]
      })%>

      ```


      Value Hash Parameters | &nbsp;

      --- | ---

      `urls` | Array of URLs to send the webhook to.

      `method` | Default: `GET`.  May also be set to `POST`.

      `triggers` | Leave blank to send webhooks on any action on this folder.  Or, for specific actions, you may specify an array of action types.  Valid values are: `create`, `read`, `update`, `destroy`, `move`, `copy`.

      `encoding` | May be `JSON`, `XML`, or `RAW`.  If set to `RAW` or left blank, we will deliver the webhook using the HTTP GET params or POST body.  If JSON or XML, we will encode the payload accordingly and send a matching `Content-Type` header.
    requires_attachment: false
    supports_mounted_folders: true
    unique_per_folder: false
    visible_to_non_admins: false
  - behavior: file_expiration
    children_can_add: false
    children_can_override: true
    docs: >
      Files in this folder will expire (be deleted) after a certain number of days.  This is most often used for compliance purposes where different types of data may need different retention settings.  It's also great for managing your costs.  You can retain different data for less time than others.


      Value is stored as an Integer (not a hash/array) representing the number of days.


      > Example Value


      ```json

      <%=JSON.pretty_generate(30)%>

      ```
    requires_attachment: false
    supports_mounted_folders: false
    unique_per_folder: true
    visible_to_non_admins: true
  - behavior: auto_encrypt
    children_can_add: false
    children_can_override: true
    docs: >
      Files will be automatically encrypted after uploading using your provided GPG key.


      This Behavior is often used on our HIPAA accounts to convert data into a format unreadable by even us.

      GPG is an asymmetric encryption type (which means it uses public keys and private keys).

      Because you are only providing us your public key and keeping your private key, we won't be able to read anything once it has been GPG encrypted.


      > Example Value


      ```json

      <%=JSON.pretty_generate({
        'algorithm' => 'PGP/GPG',
        'suffix' => '.gpg',
        'key' => '[your GPG public key]',
        'armor' => 'false'
      })%>

      ```


      Value Hash Parameters | &nbsp;

      --- | ---

      `algorithm` | Must be set to `PGP/GPG`.  If we support other options in the future (like OpenSSL), we will amend this option.

      `suffix` | Suffix to apply to filenames once they've been uploaded.

      `key` | Your GPG public key.  Please be sure not to send your private key here. If that happens, we try to detect it and disable the behavior for your security.

      `armor` |  If true, encrypted files are written as ascii text.

    docs: >
      The subfolder structure of this folder may not be changed.

      This is useful in conjunction with workflows and automations to ensure your folder structure stays as you expect.


      Children Recursive: Do not allow Create/Move/Delete on parent folder, child folders and any descendant folders.

      Children: Do not allow Create/Move/Delete on parent folder or child folders but do allow on any descendant folders.

      Self: Do not allow Delete or Rename of this(parent) folder. Do allow Create/Move/Delete on child folders and any descendant folders.


      > Example Value


      ```json

      <%=JSON.pretty_generate({
        'level' => 'children_recursive'
      })%>

      ```


      Value Hash Parameters | &nbsp;

      --- | ---

      `level` | URL key used for the inbox. Can be `children_recursive` (default), `children`, `self`, or `none`.

    docs: >-
      Files in this folder are stored in a certain geographical region.

      If you set this Behavior on an existing folder, we will migrate existing files to the new location automatically.


      > Example Value


      ```json

      <%=JSON.pretty_generate('us-east-1')%>

      ```


      Value is stored as a String.  Valid region values:


      Value String | Region Description

      --- | ---

      `us-east-1` | USA, Virginia

      `ap-southeast-2` | Australia, Sydney

    children_can_override: false
    docs: >
      Files in this folder are served via a public HTTPS URL at `https://SUBDOMAIN.hosted-by-files.com/...`


      This feature works with common static site generators such as Jekyll and Middleman, and allows any static web assets or website to be hosted.

      It's a great way to get extra mileage out of your Files.com account and avoid having to pay for separate web hosting.


      > Example Value


      ```json

      <%=JSON.pretty_generate({
        'key' => 'public-photos',
        'show_index' => true

      Value Hash Parameters | &nbsp;

      --- | ---

      `key` | URL path for where the stuff is publicly hosted.  It will look like `https://SUBDOMAIN.hosted-by-files.com/{key}/`

      `show_index` | Show an index page listing the folder contents?
    requires_attachment: false
    supports_mounted_folders: true
    unique_per_folder: true
    visible_to_non_admins: true
  - behavior: create_user_folders
    children_can_add: true
    children_can_override: false
    docs: >
      Create a folder here for new users when they are added.

      This Behavior is typically used to implement home folders for users.

      It's also a good building block for more advanced automations and workflows.


      > Example Value


      ```json

      <%=JSON.pretty_generate({
        'permission' => 'full',
        'existing_users' => true,
        'group_id' => 1,
        'new_folder_name' => 'username'
      })%>

      ```


      Value Hash Parameters | &nbsp;

      --- | ---

      `permission` | What permission level to give the user on his or her new folder?  Takes the same options as the Permissions endpoint.

      `existing_users` | Apply this behavior to existing users or only newly added users?

    docs: >
      Sync this folder to a remote server on a regular basis.  Remote servers can be FTP/SFTP servers, Amazon S3/GCP/Azure Blob/Wasabi/Backblaze B2 Buckets, and more.

      See the RemoteServer object for a full list of the Remote Servers supported.


      One-way and two-way sync options are supported.


      With this behavior, the Sync between Files.com and the RemoteServer occurs on a schedule.  Your plan level determines the frequency of the Sync schedule.

      Higher plans offer faster sync intervals.


      If you want to instead "mount" your RemoteServer for real-time operations within Files.com, please see the RemoteServerMount behavior instead.


      > Example Value


      ```json

      <%=JSON.pretty_generate({
        'remote_server_id' => '1',
        'direction' => 'two_way',
        'keep_after_copy' => 'keep',
        'remote_path' => ''
