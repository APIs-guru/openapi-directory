        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve information about multiple suppression groups.**

        This endpoint will return information for each group ID that you include in your request. To add a group ID to your request, simply append `&id=` followed by the group ID.

        Suppressions are a list of email addresses that will not receive content sent under a given [group](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Suppression_Management/groups.html).

        Suppression groups, or [unsubscribe groups](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Suppression_Management/groups.html), allow you to label a category of content that you regularly send. This gives your recipients the ability to opt out of a specific set of your email. For example, you might define a group for your transactional email, and one for your marketing email so that your users can continue recieving your transactional email witout having to receive your marketing content.

        Suppressions are recipient email addresses that are added to [unsubscribe groups](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Suppression_Management/groups.html). Once a recipient's address is on the suppressions list for an unsubscribe group, they will not receive any emails that are tagged with that unsubscribe group.

        **This endpoint allows you to create a campaign.**

        Our Marketing Campaigns API lets you create, manage, send, and schedule campaigns.

        Note: In order to send or schedule the campaign, you will be required to provide a subject, sender ID, content (we suggest both html and plain text), and at least one list or segment ID. This information is not required when you create a campaign.

        Batch deletion of a page makes it possible to receive an empty page of recipients before reaching the end of
        the list of recipients. To avoid this issue; iterate over pages until a 404 is retrieved.

        field_name:

        * is a variable that is substituted for your actual custom field name from your recipient.
        * Text fields must be url-encoded. Date fields are searchable only by unix timestamp (e.g. 2/2/2015 becomes 1422835200)
        * If field_name is a 'reserved' date field, such as created_at or updated_at, the system will internally convert
        your epoch time to a date range encompassing the entire day. For example, an epoch time of 1422835600 converts to
        Mon, 02 Feb 2015 00:06:40 GMT, but internally the system will search from Mon, 02 Feb 2015 00:00:00 GMT through

        **This endpoint allows you to create a segment.**

        All recipients in your contactdb will be added or removed automatically depending on whether they match the criteria for this segment.

        List Id:

        * Send this to segment from an existing list
        * Don't send this in order to segment from your entire contactdb.

        Valid operators for create and update depend on the type of the field you are segmenting: 

        * **Dates:** "eq", "ne", "lt" (before), "gt" (after) 
        * **Text:** "contains", "eq" (is - matches the full field), "ne" (is not - matches any field where the entire field is not the condition value) 
        * **Numbers:** "eq", "lt", "gt" 
        * **Email Clicks and Opens:** "eq" (opened), "ne" (not opened) 

        Segment conditions using "eq" or "ne" for email clicks and opens should provide a "field" of either *clicks.campaign_identifier* or *opens.campaign_identifier*. The condition value should be a string containing the id of a completed campaign. 

        Segments may contain multiple condtions, joined by an "and" or "or" in the "and_or" field. The first condition in the conditions list must have an empty "and_or", and subsequent conditions must all specify an "and_or".

        The Contacts API helps you manage your [Marketing Campaigns](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/index.html) recipients.

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve your email statistics segmented by country and state/province.**

        **We only store up to 7 days of email activity in our database.** By default, 500 items will be returned per request via the Advanced Stats API endpoints.

        Advanced Stats provide a more in-depth view of your email statistics and the actions taken by your recipients. You can segment these statistics by geographic location, device type, client type, browser, and mailbox provider.

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve a list of all assigned and unassigned IPs.**

        Response includes warm up status, pools, assigned subusers, and whitelabel info. The start_date field corresponds to when warmup started for that IP.

        A single IP address or a range of IP addresses may be dedicated to an account in order to send email for multiple domains. The reputation of this IP is based on the aggregate performance of all the senders who use it.

Then at anytime up to 10 minutes before the schedule date, you can cancel all of the mail/send requests that have this batch ID by calling the Cancel Scheduled Send endpoint.

        This endpoint allows you to send email over SendGrid’s v3 Web API, the most recent version of our API. If you are looking for documentation about the v2 Mail Send endpoint, please see our [v2 API Reference](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/mail.html).

        * Top level parameters are referred to as "global".
        * Individual fields within the personalizations array will override any other global, or “message level”, parameters that are defined outside of personalizations.
         
        **SendGrid provides libraries to help you quickly and easily integrate with the v3 Web API in 7 different languages: [C#](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-csharp), [Go](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-go), [Java](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-java), [Node JS](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs), [PHP](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php), [Python](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python), and [Ruby](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby).**

        **This endpoint allows you to update your current legacy email template settings.**

        This setting refers to our original email templates. We currently support more fully featured [transactional templates](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Transactional_Templates/index.html). 

        The legacy email template setting wraps an HTML template around your email content. This can be useful for sending out marketing email and/or other HTML formatted messages.

        Mail settings allow you to tell SendGrid specific things to do to every email that you send to your recipients over SendGrid’s [Web API](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/mail.html) or [SMTP Relay](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/SMTP_API/index.html).

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve your email statistics segmented by recipient mailbox provider.**

        **We only store up to 7 days of email activity in our database.** By default, 500 items will be returned per request via the Advanced Stats API endpoints.

        Advanced Stats provide a more in-depth view of your email statistics and the actions taken by your recipients. You can segment these statistics by geographic location, device type, client type, browser, and mailbox provider. For more information about statistics, please see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Statistics/index.html).

        **This endpoint allows you to update a sender identity.**

        Updates to `from.email` require re-verification. If your domain has been whitelabeled it will auto verify on creation. Otherwise an email will be sent to the `from.email`.

        Partial updates are allowed, but fields that are marked as "required" in the POST (create) endpoint must not be nil if that field is included in the PATCH request.

        Subuser sender reputations give a good idea how well a sender is doing with regards to how recipients and recipient servers react to the mail that is being received. When a bounce, spam report, or other negative action happens on a sent email, it will effect your sender rating.

        This endpoint allows you to request the reputations for your subusers.

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve the email statistics for the given subusers.**

        You may retrieve statistics for up to 10 different subusers by including an additional _subusers_ parameter for each additional subuser.

        While you can always view the statistics for all email activity on your account, subuser statistics enable you to view specific segments of your stats. Emails sent, bounces, and spam reports are always tracked for subusers. Unsubscribes, clicks, and opens are tracked if you have enabled the required settings.

        For more information, see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Statistics/subuser.html).

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve the monthly email statistics for all subusers over the given date range.**

        While you can always view the statistics for all email activity on your account, subuser statistics enable you to view specific segments of your stats for your subusers. Emails sent, bounces, and spam reports are always tracked for subusers. Unsubscribes, clicks, and opens are tracked if you have enabled the required settings.

        When using the `sort_by_metric` to sort your stats by a specific metric, you can not sort by the following metrics:
        `bounce_drops`, `deferred`, `invalid_emails`, `processed`, `spam_report_drops`, `spam_reports`, or `unsubscribe_drops`.

        **This endpoint allows you to delete all email addresses on your blocks list.**

        There are two options for deleting blocked emails: 

        1. You can delete all blocked emails by setting `delete_all` to true in the request body. 
        2. You can delete some blocked emails by specifying the email addresses in an array in the request body.

        [Blocks](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Glossary/blocks.html) happen when your message was rejected for a reason related to the message, not the recipient address. This can happen when your mail server IP address has been added to a blacklist or blocked by an ISP, or if the message content is flagged by a filter on the receiving server.

        **This endpoint allows you to remove email addresses from your invalid email address list.**

        There are two options for deleting invalid email addresses: 

        1) You can delete all invalid email addresses by setting `delete_all` to true in the request body.
        2) You can delete some invalid email addresses by specifying certain addresses in an array in the request body.

        An invalid email occurs when you attempt to send email to an address that is formatted in a manner that does not meet internet email format standards or the email does not exist at the recipient’s mail server.

        Examples include addresses without the “@” sign or addresses that include certain special characters and/or spaces. This response can come from our own server or the recipient mail server.

        There are two options for deleting spam reports: 

        1) You can delete all spam reports by setting "delete_all" to true in the request body. 
        2) You can delete some spam reports by specifying the email addresses in an array in the request body.

        This endpoint allows you to send a teammate invitation via email with a predefined set of scopes, or permissions.

        **Note:** A teammate invite will expire after 7 days, but you may resend the invite at any time to reset the expiration date.

        Essentials, [Legacy Lite](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Basics/Billing/legacy_lite_plan.html), and Free Trial users may create up to one teammate per account. There are no limits for how many teammates a Pro or higher account may create.

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve the statistics for your Parse Webhook useage.**

        SendGrid's Inbound Parse Webhook allows you to parse the contents and attachments of incomming emails. The Parse API can then POST the parsed emails to a URL that you specify. The Inbound Parse Webhook cannot parse messages greater than 20MB in size, including all attachments.

        There are a number of pre-made integrations for the SendGrid Parse Webhook which make processing events easy. You can find these integrations in the [Library Index](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Integrate/libraries.html#-Webhook-Libraries).

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve a list of all domain whitelabels you have created.**

        A domain whitelabel allows you to remove the “via” or “sent on behalf of” message that your recipients see when they read your emails. Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain.

        **This endpoint allows you to create a whitelabel for one of your domains.**

        If you are creating a domain whitelabel that you would like a subuser to use, you have two options:
        1. Use the "username" parameter. This allows you to create a whitelabel on behalf of your subuser. This means the subuser is able to see and modify the created whitelabel.
        2. Use the Association workflow (see Associate Domain section). This allows you to assign a whitelabel created by the parent to a subuser. This means the subuser will default to the assigned whitelabel, but will not be able to see or modify that whitelabel. However, if the subuser creates their own whitelabel it will overwrite the assigned whitelabel.

        A domain whitelabel allows you to remove the “via” or “sent on behalf of” message that your recipients see when they read your emails. Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain. You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider. If you choose to use Automated Security, SendGrid will provide you with 3 CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you will be given 2 TXT records and 1 MX record.

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve the default whitelabel for a domain.**

        A domain whitelabel allows you to remove the “via” or “sent on behalf of” message that your recipients see when they read your emails. Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain. You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider. If you choose to use Automated Security, SendGrid will provide you with 3 CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you will be given 2 TXT records and 1 MX record.

        **This endpoint allows you to remove a domain's IP address from that domain's whitelabel.**

        A domain whitelabel allows you to remove the “via” or “sent on behalf of” message that your recipients see when they read your emails. Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain. You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider. If you choose to use Automated Security, SendGrid will provide you with 3 CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you will be given 2 TXT records and 1 MX record.

        For more information on whitelabeling, please see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/Whitelabel/index.html)

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve the default link whitelabel.**

        Default link whitelabel is the actual link whitelabel to be used when sending messages. If there are multiple link whitelabels, the default is determined by the following order:
        <ul>
          <li>Validated link whitelabels marked as "default"</li>
          <li>Legacy link whitelabels (migrated from the whitelabel wizard)</li>
          <li>Default SendGrid link whitelabel (i.e. 100.ct.sendgrid.net)</li>
        </ul>

        Email link whitelabels allow all of the click-tracked links you send in your emails to include the URL of your domain instead of sendgrid.net.

        **This endpoint allows you to associate a link whitelabel with a subuser account.**

        Link whitelables can be associated with subusers from the parent account. This functionality allows
        subusers to send mail using their parent's linke whitelabels. To associate a link whitelabel, the parent account
        must first create a whitelabel and validate it. The parent may then associate that whitelabel with a subuser via the API or the Subuser Management page in the user interface.

        Email link whitelabels allow all of the click-tracked links you send in your emails to include the URL of your domain instead of sendgrid.net.

        For more information, please see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Whitelabel/links.html).
