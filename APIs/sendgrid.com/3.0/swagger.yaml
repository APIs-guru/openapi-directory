        **This endpoint allows you to delete a suppression group.**

        You can only delete groups that have not been attached to sent mail in the last 60 days. If a recipient uses the "one-click unsubscribe" option on an email associated with a deleted group, that recipient will be added to the global suppression list.

        Suppression groups, or unsubscribe groups, are specific types or categories of email that you would like your recipients to be able to unsubscribe from. For example: Daily Newsletters, Invoices, System Alerts.

        The **name** and **description** of the unsubscribe group will be visible by recipients when they are managing their subscriptions.

        Each user can create up to 25 different suppression groups.

        A domain whitelabel allows you to remove the “via” or “sent on behalf of” message that your recipients see when they read your emails. Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain. You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider. If you choose to use Automated Security, SendGrid will provide you with 3 CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you will be given 2 TXT records and 1 MX record.

        **This endpoint allows you to associate a specific domain whitelabel with a subuser.**

        A domain whitelabel allows you to remove the “via” or “sent on behalf of” message that your recipients see when they read your emails. Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain. You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider. If you choose to use Automated Security, SendGrid will provide you with 3 CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you will be given 2 TXT records and 1 MX record.

        Domain whitelabels can be associated with (i.e. assigned to) subusers from a parent account. This functionality allows subusers to send mail using their parent's whitelabels. To associate a whitelabel with a subuser, the parent account must first create the whitelabel and validate it. The the parent may then associate the whitelabel via the subuser management tools.

        A domain whitelabel allows you to remove the “via” or “sent on behalf of” message that your recipients see when they read your emails. Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain. You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider. If you choose to use Automated Security, SendGrid will provide you with 3 CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you will be given 2 TXT records and 1 MX record.

        field_name:

        * is a variable that is substituted for your actual custom field name from your recipient.
        * Text fields must be url-encoded. Date fields are searchable only by unix timestamp (e.g. 2/2/2015 becomes 1422835200)
        * If field_name is a 'reserved' date field, such as created_at or updated_at, the system will internally convert
        your epoch time to a date range encompassing the entire day. For example, an epoch time of 1422835600 converts to
        Mon, 02 Feb 2015 00:06:40 GMT, but internally the system will search from Mon, 02 Feb 2015 00:00:00 GMT through
        Mon, 02 Feb 2015 23:59:59 GMT.

        Note: In order to send or schedule the campaign, you will be required to provide a subject, sender ID, content (we suggest both html and plain text), and at least one list or segment ID. This information is not required when you create a campaign.

        A domain whitelabel allows you to remove the “via” or “sent on behalf of” message that your recipients see when they read your emails. Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain. You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider. If you choose to use Automated Security, SendGrid will provide you with 3 CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you will be given 2 TXT records and 1 MX record.

        For more information on whitelabeling, please see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/Whitelabel/index.html)

      summary: Create a domain whitelabel.
      description: |-
        **This endpoint allows you to create a whitelabel for one of your domains.**

        If you are creating a domain whitelabel that you would like a subuser to use, you have two options:
        1. Use the "username" parameter. This allows you to create a whitelabel on behalf of your subuser. This means the subuser is able to see and modify the created whitelabel.
        2. Use the Association workflow (see Associate Domain section). This allows you to assign a whitelabel created by the parent to a subuser. This means the subuser will default to the assigned whitelabel, but will not be able to see or modify that whitelabel. However, if the subuser creates their own whitelabel it will overwrite the assigned whitelabel.

        A domain whitelabel allows you to remove the “via” or “sent on behalf of” message that your recipients see when they read your emails. Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain. You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider. If you choose to use Automated Security, SendGrid will provide you with 3 CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you will be given 2 TXT records and 1 MX record.

        For more information on whitelabeling, please see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/Whitelabel/index.html)

      summary: List all domain whitelabels.
      description: |
        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve a list of all domain whitelabels you have created.**

        A domain whitelabel allows you to remove the “via” or “sent on behalf of” message that your recipients see when they read your emails. Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain. You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider. If you choose to use Automated Security, SendGrid will provide you with 3 CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you will be given 2 TXT records and 1 MX record.

        For more information on whitelabeling, please see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/Whitelabel/index.html)

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve the statistics for your Parse Webhook useage.**

        SendGrid's Inbound Parse Webhook allows you to parse the contents and attachments of incomming emails. The Parse API can then POST the parsed emails to a URL that you specify. The Inbound Parse Webhook cannot parse messages greater than 20MB in size, including all attachments.

        There are a number of pre-made integrations for the SendGrid Parse Webhook which make processing events easy. You can find these integrations in the [Library Index](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Integrate/libraries.html#-Webhook-Libraries).

      summary: Retrieve email statistics for your subusers.
      description: |-
        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve the email statistics for the given subusers.**

        You may retrieve statistics for up to 10 different subusers by including an additional _subusers_ parameter for each additional subuser.

        While you can always view the statistics for all email activity on your account, subuser statistics enable you to view specific segments of your stats. Emails sent, bounces, and spam reports are always tracked for subusers. Unsubscribes, clicks, and opens are tracked if you have enabled the required settings.

        For more information, see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Statistics/subuser.html).

        SendGrid can automatically warm up dedicated IP addresses by limiting the amount of mail that can be sent through them per hour, with the limit determined by how long the IP address has been in warmup. See the [warmup schedule](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/IP_Management/ip_warmup_schedule.html) for more details on how SendGrid limits your email traffic for IPs in warmup.

        For more general information about warming up IPs, please see our [Classroom](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Deliver/Delivery_Introduction/warming_up_ips.html).
