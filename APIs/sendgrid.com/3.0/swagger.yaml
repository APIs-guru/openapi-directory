        **This endpoint allows you to perform a search on all of your Marketing Campaigns recipients.**

        field_name:

        * is a variable that is substituted for your actual custom field name from your recipient.
        * Text fields must be url-encoded. Date fields are searchable only by unix timestamp (e.g. 2/2/2015 becomes 1422835200)
        * If field_name is a 'reserved' date field, such as created_at or updated_at, the system will internally convert
        your epoch time to a date range encompassing the entire day. For example, an epoch time of 1422835600 converts to
        Mon, 02 Feb 2015 00:06:40 GMT, but internally the system will search from Mon, 02 Feb 2015 00:00:00 GMT through
        Mon, 02 Feb 2015 23:59:59 GMT.

        **This endpoint allows you to create a segment.**

        All recipients in your contactdb will be added or removed automatically depending on whether they match the criteria for this segment.

        List Id:

        * Send this to segment from an existing list
        * Don't send this in order to segment from your entire contactdb.

        Valid operators for create and update depend on the type of the field you are segmenting: 

        * **Dates:** "eq", "ne", "lt" (before), "gt" (after) 
        * **Text:** "contains", "eq" (is - matches the full field), "ne" (is not - matches any field where the entire field is not the condition value) 
        * **Numbers:** "eq", "lt", "gt" 
        * **Email Clicks and Opens:** "eq" (opened), "ne" (not opened) 

        Segment conditions using "eq" or "ne" for email clicks and opens should provide a "field" of either *clicks.campaign_identifier* or *opens.campaign_identifier*. The condition value should be a string containing the id of a completed campaign. 

        Segments may contain multiple condtions, joined by an "and" or "or" in the "and_or" field. The first condition in the conditions list must have an empty "and_or", and subsequent conditions must all specify an "and_or".

        The Contacts API helps you manage your [Marketing Campaigns](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/index.html) recipients.

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve the email statistics for the given subusers.**

        You may retrieve statistics for up to 10 different subusers by including an additional _subusers_ parameter for each additional subuser.

        While you can always view the statistics for all email activity on your account, subuser statistics enable you to view specific segments of your stats. Emails sent, bounces, and spam reports are always tracked for subusers. Unsubscribes, clicks, and opens are tracked if you have enabled the required settings.

        **This endpoint allows you to delete all email addresses on your blocks list.**

        There are two options for deleting blocked emails: 

        1. You can delete all blocked emails by setting `delete_all` to true in the request body. 
        2. You can delete some blocked emails by specifying the email addresses in an array in the request body.

        [Blocks](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Glossary/blocks.html) happen when your message was rejected for a reason related to the message, not the recipient address. This can happen when your mail server IP address has been added to a blacklist or blocked by an ISP, or if the message content is flagged by a filter on the receiving server.

        **This endpoint allows you to remove email addresses from your invalid email address list.**

        There are two options for deleting invalid email addresses: 

        1) You can delete all invalid email addresses by setting `delete_all` to true in the request body.
        2) You can delete some invalid email addresses by specifying certain addresses in an array in the request body.

        An invalid email occurs when you attempt to send email to an address that is formatted in a manner that does not meet internet email format standards or the email does not exist at the recipient’s mail server.

        Examples include addresses without the “@” sign or addresses that include certain special characters and/or spaces. This response can come from our own server or the recipient mail server.

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve the statistics for your Parse Webhook useage.**

        SendGrid's Inbound Parse Webhook allows you to parse the contents and attachments of incomming emails. The Parse API can then POST the parsed emails to a URL that you specify. The Inbound Parse Webhook cannot parse messages greater than 20MB in size, including all attachments.

        There are a number of pre-made integrations for the SendGrid Parse Webhook which make processing events easy. You can find these integrations in the [Library Index](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Integrate/libraries.html#-Webhook-Libraries).

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve a list of all domain whitelabels you have created.**

        A domain whitelabel allows you to remove the “via” or “sent on behalf of” message that your recipients see when they read your emails. Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain. You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider. If you choose to use Automated Security, SendGrid will provide you with 3 CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you will be given 2 TXT records and 1 MX record.

        For more information on whitelabeling, please see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/Whitelabel/index.html)

        **This endpoint allows you to create a whitelabel for one of your domains.**

        If you are creating a domain whitelabel that you would like a subuser to use, you have two options:
        1. Use the "username" parameter. This allows you to create a whitelabel on behalf of your subuser. This means the subuser is able to see and modify the created whitelabel.
        2. Use the Association workflow (see Associate Domain section). This allows you to assign a whitelabel created by the parent to a subuser. This means the subuser will default to the assigned whitelabel, but will not be able to see or modify that whitelabel. However, if the subuser creates their own whitelabel it will overwrite the assigned whitelabel.

        A domain whitelabel allows you to remove the “via” or “sent on behalf of” message that your recipients see when they read your emails. Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain. You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider. If you choose to use Automated Security, SendGrid will provide you with 3 CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you will be given 2 TXT records and 1 MX record.

        A domain whitelabel allows you to remove the “via” or “sent on behalf of” message that your recipients see when they read your emails. Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain. You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider. If you choose to use Automated Security, SendGrid will provide you with 3 CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you will be given 2 TXT records and 1 MX record.

        Domain whitelabels can be associated with (i.e. assigned to) subusers from a parent account. This functionality allows subusers to send mail using their parent's whitelabels. To associate a whitelabel with a subuser, the parent account must first create the whitelabel and validate it. The the parent may then associate the whitelabel via the subuser management tools.

        **This endpoint allows you to associate a specific domain whitelabel with a subuser.**

        A domain whitelabel allows you to remove the “via” or “sent on behalf of” message that your recipients see when they read your emails. Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain. You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider. If you choose to use Automated Security, SendGrid will provide you with 3 CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you will be given 2 TXT records and 1 MX record.

        Domain whitelabels can be associated with (i.e. assigned to) subusers from a parent account. This functionality allows subusers to send mail using their parent's whitelabels. To associate a whitelabel with a subuser, the parent account must first create the whitelabel and validate it. The the parent may then associate the whitelabel via the subuser management tools.

        For more information on whitelabeling, please see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/Whitelabel/index.html)

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve all of the IP whitelabels that have been createdy by this account.**

        You may include a search key by using the "ip" parameter. This enables you to perform a prefix search for a given IP segment (e.g. "192.").

        A IP whitelabel consists of a subdomain and domain that will be used to generate a reverse DNS record for a given IP. Once SendGrid has verified that the appropriate A record for the IP has been created, the appropriate reverse DNS record for the IP is generated.

        **This endpoint allows you to create an IP whitelabel.**

        When creating an IP whitelable, you should use the same subdomain that you used when you created a domain whitelabel.

        A IP whitelabel consists of a subdomain and domain that will be used to generate a reverse DNS record for a given IP. Once SendGrid has verified that the appropriate A record for the IP has been created, the appropriate reverse DNS record for the IP is generated.

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve the default link whitelabel.**

        Default link whitelabel is the actual link whitelabel to be used when sending messages. If there are multiple link whitelabels, the default is determined by the following order:
        <ul>
          <li>Validated link whitelabels marked as "default"</li>
          <li>Legacy link whitelabels (migrated from the whitelabel wizard)</li>
          <li>Default SendGrid link whitelabel (i.e. 100.ct.sendgrid.net)</li>
        </ul>

        Email link whitelabels allow all of the click-tracked links you send in your emails to include the URL of your domain instead of sendgrid.net.

        **This endpoint allows you to associate a link whitelabel with a subuser account.**

        Link whitelables can be associated with subusers from the parent account. This functionality allows
        subusers to send mail using their parent's linke whitelabels. To associate a link whitelabel, the parent account
        must first create a whitelabel and validate it. The parent may then associate that whitelabel with a subuser via the API or the Subuser Management page in the user interface.

        Email link whitelabels allow all of the click-tracked links you send in your emails to include the URL of your domain instead of sendgrid.net.

        For more information, please see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Whitelabel/links.html).
