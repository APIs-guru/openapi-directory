# JSONModelFeature

Exported Model - Phraselist Model Feature.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**activated** | **bool** | Indicates if the feature is enabled. | [optional] 
**mode** | **bool** | An interchangeable phrase list feature serves as a list of synonyms for training. A non-exchangeable phrase list serves as separate features for training. So, if your non-interchangeable phrase list contains 5 phrases, they will be mapped to 5 separate features. You can think of the non-interchangeable phrase list as an additional bag of words to add to LUIS existing vocabulary features. It is used as a lexicon lookup feature where its value is 1 if the lexicon contains a given word or 0 if it doesnâ€™t.  Default value is true. | [optional] 
**name** | **str** | The Phraselist name. | [optional] 
**words** | **str** | List of comma-separated phrases that represent the Phraselist. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.json_model_feature import JSONModelFeature

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of JSONModelFeature from a JSON string
json_model_feature_instance = JSONModelFeature.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(JSONModelFeature.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
json_model_feature_dict = json_model_feature_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of JSONModelFeature from a dict
json_model_feature_from_dict = JSONModelFeature.from_dict(json_model_feature_dict)
