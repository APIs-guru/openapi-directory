    Azure Feature Exposure Control (AFEC) provides a mechanism for the resource providers to control feature exposure to users. Resource providers typically use this mechanism to provide public/private preview for new features prior to making them generally available. Users need to explicitly register for AFEC features to get access to such functionality.
