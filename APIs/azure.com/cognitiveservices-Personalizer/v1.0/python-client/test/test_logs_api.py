    Personalizer Client

    Personalizer Service is an Azure Cognitive Service that makes it easy to target content and experiences without complex pre-analysis or cleanup of past data. Given a context and featurized content, the Personalizer Service returns which content item to show to users in rewardActionId. As rewards are sent in response to the use of rewardActionId, the reinforcement learning algorithm will improve the model and improve performance of future rank calls.
