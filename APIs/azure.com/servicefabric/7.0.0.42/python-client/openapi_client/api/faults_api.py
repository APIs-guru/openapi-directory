        Starts or stops a cluster node.  A cluster node is a process, not the OS instance itself.  To start a node, pass in \"Start\" for the NodeTransitionType parameter. To stop a node, pass in \"Stop\" for the NodeTransitionType parameter.  This API starts the operation - when the API returns the node may not have finished transitioning yet. Call GetNodeTransitionProgress with the same OperationId to get the progress of the operation.

Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API.

Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime.
