# **delete_application**
> delete_application(api_version, application_id, force_remove=force_remove, timeout=timeout)

Deletes an existing Service Fabric application.

An application must be created before it can be deleted. Deleting an application will delete all services that are part of that application. By default, Service Fabric will try to close service replicas in a graceful manner and then delete the service. However, if a service is having issues closing the replica gracefully, the delete operation may take a long time or get stuck. Use the optional ForceRemove flag to skip the graceful close sequence and forcefully delete the application and all of its services.

------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **application_id** | **str**| The identity of the application. This is typically the full name of the application without the &#39;fabric:&#39; URI scheme. Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the \&quot;~\&quot; character. For example, if the application name is \&quot;fabric:/myapp/app1\&quot;, the application identity would be \&quot;myapp~app1\&quot; in 6.0+ and \&quot;myapp/app1\&quot; in previous versions. |

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **api_version** | **str**| The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be &#39;6.1&#39;.  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.  Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. | [default to 6.1]
 **node_name** | **str**| The name of the node. | 
 **application_id** | **str**| The identity of the application. This is typically the full name of the application without the &#39;fabric:&#39; URI scheme. Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the \&quot;~\&quot; character. For example, if the application name is \&quot;fabric:/myapp/app1\&quot;, the application identity would be \&quot;myapp~app1\&quot; in 6.0+ and \&quot;myapp/app1\&quot; in previous versions. | 
 **timeout** | **int**| The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds. | [optional] [default to 60]

> PagedDeployedApplicationInfoList get_deployed_application_info_list(api_version, node_name, timeout=timeout, include_health_state=include_health_state, continuation_token=continuation_token, max_results=max_results)

Gets the list of applications deployed on a Service Fabric node.

Gets the list of applications deployed on a Service Fabric node. The results do not include information about deployed system applications unless explicitly queried for by ID. Results encompass deployed applications in active, activating, and downloading states. This query requires that the node name corresponds to a node on the cluster. The query fails if the provided node name does not point to any active Service Fabric nodes on the cluster.

# **report_application_health**
> report_application_health(api_version, application_id, health_information, immediate=immediate, timeout=timeout)

Sends a health report on the Service Fabric application.

Reports health state of the specified Service Fabric application. The report must contain the information about the source of the health report and property on which it is reported. The report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store. The report may be accepted by the gateway, but rejected by the health store after extra validation. For example, the health store may reject the report because of an invalid parameter, like a stale sequence number. To see whether the report was applied in the health store, get application health and check that the report appears in the HealthEvents section.

This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.  Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. | [default to 6.0]
 **application_id** | **str**| The identity of the application. This is typically the full name of the application without the &#39;fabric:&#39; URI scheme. Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the \&quot;~\&quot; character. For example, if the application name is \&quot;fabric:/myapp/app1\&quot;, the application identity would be \&quot;myapp~app1\&quot; in 6.0+ and \&quot;myapp/app1\&quot; in previous versions. | 
 **resume_application_upgrade_description** | [**ResumeApplicationUpgradeDescription**](ResumeApplicationUpgradeDescription.md)| Describes the parameters for resuming an application upgrade. | 
 **timeout** | **int**| The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds. | [optional] [default to 60]

# **rollback_application_upgrade**
> rollback_application_upgrade(api_version, application_id, timeout=timeout)

Starts rolling back the currently on-going upgrade of an application in the Service Fabric cluster.

Starts rolling back the current application upgrade to the previous version. This API can only be used to roll back the current in-progress upgrade that is rolling forward to new version. If the application is not currently being upgraded use StartApplicationUpgrade API to upgrade it to desired version, including rolling back to a previous version.

### Example


```python
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to http://azure.local:19080
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "http://azure.local:19080"
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class

    application_id = 'application_id_example' # str | The identity of the application. This is typically the full name of the application without the 'fabric:' URI scheme. Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the \"~\" character. For example, if the application name is \"fabric:/myapp/app1\", the application identity would be \"myapp~app1\" in 6.0+ and \"myapp/app1\" in previous versions.
    timeout = 60 # int | The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds. (optional) (default to 60)
