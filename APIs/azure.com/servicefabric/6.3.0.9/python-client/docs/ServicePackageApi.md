# **deploy_service_package_to_node**
> deploy_service_package_to_node(api_version, node_name, deploy_service_package_to_node_description, timeout=timeout)

Downloads all of the code packages associated with specified service manifest on the specified node.

This API provides a way to download code packages including the container images on a specific node outside of the normal application deployment and upgrade path. This is useful for the large code packages and container images to be present on the node before the actual application deployment and upgrade, thus significantly reducing the total time required for the deployment or upgrade.

### Example


```python

Returns the information about the service packages deployed on a Service Fabric node for the given application. These results are of service packages whose name match exactly the service package name specified as the parameter.

### Example


```python
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.models.deployed_service_package_info import DeployedServicePackageInfo
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to http://azure.local:19080
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "http://azure.local:19080"
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.ServicePackageApi(api_client)
    api_version = 6.0 # str | The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'.  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.  Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. (default to 6.0)
    node_name = 'node_name_example' # str | The name of the node.
    application_id = 'application_id_example' # str | The identity of the application. This is typically the full name of the application without the 'fabric:' URI scheme. Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the \"~\" character. For example, if the application name is \"fabric:/myapp/app1\", the application identity would be \"myapp~app1\" in 6.0+ and \"myapp/app1\" in previous versions.
    service_package_name = 'service_package_name_example' # str | The name of the service package.
    timeout = 60 # int | The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds. (optional) (default to 60)

    try:
        # Gets the list of service packages deployed on a Service Fabric node matching exactly the specified name.
        api_response = api_instance.get_deployed_service_package_info_list_by_name(api_version, node_name, application_id, service_package_name, timeout=timeout)
        print("The response of ServicePackageApi->get_deployed_service_package_info_list_by_name:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling ServicePackageApi->get_deployed_service_package_info_list_by_name: %s\n" % e)
```

# **report_deployed_service_package_health**
> report_deployed_service_package_health(api_version, node_name, application_id, service_package_name, health_information, immediate=immediate, timeout=timeout)

Sends a health report on the Service Fabric deployed service package.

Reports health state of the service package of the application deployed on a Service Fabric node. The report must contain the information about the source of the health report and property on which it is reported. The report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Service, which forwards to the health store. The report may be accepted by the gateway, but rejected by the health store after extra validation. For example, the health store may reject the report because of an invalid parameter, like a stale sequence number. To see whether the report was applied in the health store, get deployed service package health and check that the report appears in the HealthEvents section.

### Example


```python
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.models.health_information import HealthInformation
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to http://azure.local:19080
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "http://azure.local:19080"
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.ServicePackageApi(api_client)
    api_version = 6.0 # str | The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'.  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.  Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. (default to 6.0)
    node_name = 'node_name_example' # str | The name of the node.
    application_id = 'application_id_example' # str | The identity of the application. This is typically the full name of the application without the 'fabric:' URI scheme. Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the \"~\" character. For example, if the application name is \"fabric:/myapp/app1\", the application identity would be \"myapp~app1\" in 6.0+ and \"myapp/app1\" in previous versions.
    service_package_name = 'service_package_name_example' # str | The name of the service package.
    health_information = openapi_client.HealthInformation() # HealthInformation | Describes the health information for the health report. This information needs to be present in all of the health reports sent to the health manager.
    immediate = False # bool | A flag that indicates whether the report should be sent immediately. A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store. If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from HTTP Gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the HTTP Gateway Application is using. This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible. Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the HTTP Gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the Gateway. If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the HTTP Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration. This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing. By default, reports are not sent immediately. (optional) (default to False)
    timeout = 60 # int | The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds. (optional) (default to 60)

    try:
        # Sends a health report on the Service Fabric deployed service package.
        api_instance.report_deployed_service_package_health(api_version, node_name, application_id, service_package_name, health_information, immediate=immediate, timeout=timeout)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling ServicePackageApi->report_deployed_service_package_health: %s\n" % e)
