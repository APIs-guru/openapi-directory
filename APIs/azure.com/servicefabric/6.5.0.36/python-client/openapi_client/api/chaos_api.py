To get the start of a new segment of Chaos events, you can specify the time range through StartTimeUtc and EndTimeUtc. You cannot specify both the ContinuationToken and the time range in the same call. When there are more than 100 Chaos events, the Chaos events are returned in multiple segments where a segment contains no more than 100 Chaos events and to get the next segment you make a call to this API with the continuation token.

        :param api_version: The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be '6.2'.  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This version is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.  Additionally the runtime accepts any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0 and the runtime is 6.1, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. (required)
