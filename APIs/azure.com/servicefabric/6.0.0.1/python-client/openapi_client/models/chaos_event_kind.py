This Chaos event contains the details of the faults as a list of strings. - Waiting - Indicatges a Chaos event that gets generated when Chaos is waiting for the cluster to become ready for faulting, for example, Chaos may be waiting for the on-going upgrade to finish. - ValidationFailed - Indicates a Chaos event that gets generated when the cluster entities do not become stable and healthy within ChaosParameters.MaxClusterStabilizationTimeoutInSeconds. - TestError - Indicates a Chaos event that gets generated when an unexpected event has occurred in the Chaos engine, for example, due to the cluster snapshot being inconsistent, while faulting a faultable entity Chaos found that the entity was alreay faulted. - Stopped - Indicates a Chaos event that gets generated when Chaos stops because either the user issued a stop or the time to run was up.
