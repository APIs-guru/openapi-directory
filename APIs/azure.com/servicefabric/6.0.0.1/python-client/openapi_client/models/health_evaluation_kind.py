    The health manager in the cluster performs health evalautions in determining the aggregated health state of an entity. This enumeration provides information on the kind of evaluation that was performed. Following are the possible values.    - Invalid - Indicates that the health evaluation is invalid. The value is zero.   - Event - Indicates that the health evaluation is for a health event. The value is 1.   - Replicas - Indicates that the health evaluation is for the replicas of a partition. The value is 2.   - Partitions - Indicates that the health evaluation is for the partitions of a service. The value is 3.   - DeployedServicePackages - Indicates that the health evaluation is for the deployed service packages of a deployed application. The value is 4.   - DeployedApplications - Indicates that the health evaluation is for the deployed applications of an application. The value is 5.   - Services - Indicates that the health evaluation is for services of an application. The value is 6.   - Nodes - Indicates that the health evaluation is for the cluster nodes. The value is 7.   - Applications - Indicates that the health evaluation is for the cluster applications. The value is 8.   - SystemApplication - Indicates that the health evaluation is for the system application. The value is 9.   - UpgradeDomainDeployedApplications - Indicates that the health evaluation is for the deployed applications of an application in an upgrade domain. The value is 10.   - UpgradeDomainNodes - Indicates that the health evaluation is for the cluster nodes in an upgrade domain. The value is 11.   - Node - Indicates that the health evaluation is for a node. The value is 12.   - Replica - Indicates that the health evaluation is for a replica.
