For example, if CancelOperation is called on a command of type PartitionDataLoss,    a state of \"RollingBack\" does not mean service data is being restored (assuming the command has progressed far enough to cause data loss).    It means the system is rolling back/cleaning up internal system state associated with the command. - Completed - The operation has completed successfully and is no longer running. - Faulted - The operation has failed and is no longer running. - Cancelled - The operation was cancelled by the user using CancelOperation, and is no longer running. - ForceCancelled - The operation was cancelled by the user using CancelOperation, with the force parameter set to true.  It is no longer running.  Refer to CancelOperation for more details.
