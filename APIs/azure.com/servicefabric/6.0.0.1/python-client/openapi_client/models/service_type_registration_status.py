All Service Fabric enumerations have the invalid type. The value is zero.   - Disabled - Indicates that the service type is disabled on this node.

The service type is enabled again after the process hosting it comes up and re-registers the type or a preconfigured time interval has passed. The value is 1.   - Enabled - Indicates that the service type is enabled on this node. Replicas of this service type can be placed on this node when the code package registeres the service type. The value is 2.   - Registered - Indicates that the sevice type is enabled and registered on the node by a code package. Replicas of this service type can now be olaced on this node. The value is 3.
