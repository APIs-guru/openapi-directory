Create File | Create Directory | Rename File | Rename Directory

Create or rename a file or directory.    By default, the destination is overwritten and if the destination already exists and has a lease the lease is broken.  This operation supports conditional HTTP requests.  For more information, see [Specifying Conditional Headers for Blob Service Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/specifying-conditional-headers-for-blob-service-operations).  To fail if the destination already exists, use a conditional request with If-None-Match: \"*\".

Lease Path

Create and manage a lease to restrict write and delete access to the path. This operation supports conditional HTTP requests.  For more information, see [Specifying Conditional Headers for Blob Service Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/specifying-conditional-headers-for-blob-service-operations).

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://azure.local
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(

When a lease is broken, the lease break period is allowed to elapse, during which time no lease operation except break and release can be performed on the file. When a lease is successfully broken, the response indicates the interval in seconds until a new lease can be acquired. Use \"change\" and specify the current lease ID in \"x-ms-lease-id\" and the new lease ID in \"x-ms-proposed-lease-id\" to change the lease ID of an active lease.

| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
**200** | Ok |  * x-ms-lease-status - The lease status of the resource. <br>  * x-ms-version - The version of the REST protocol used to process the request. <br>  * Content-Range - Indicates the range of bytes returned in the event that the client requested a subset of the file by setting the Range request header. <br>  * x-ms-lease-state - Lease state of the resource.  <br>  * Last-Modified - The data and time the file or directory was last modified.  Write operations on the file or directory update the last modified time. <br>  * x-ms-properties - User-defined properties associated with the file or directory, in the format of a comma-separated list of name and value pairs \&quot;n1&#x3D;v1, n2&#x3D;v2, ...\&quot;, where each value is a base64 encoded string. Note that the string may only contain ASCII characters in the ISO-8859-1 character set. <br>  * Date - A UTC date/time value generated by the service that indicates the time at which the response was initiated. <br>  * x-ms-resource-type - The type of the resource.  The value may be \&quot;file\&quot; or \&quot;directory\&quot;.  If not set, the value is \&quot;file\&quot;. <br>  * Content-MD5 - An MD5 hash of the request content.

Append Data | Flush Data | Set Properties | Set Access Control

Uploads data to be appended to a file, flushes (writes) previously uploaded data to a file, sets properties for a file or directory, or sets access control for a file or directory. Data can only be appended to a file. This operation supports conditional HTTP requests. For more information, see [Specifying Conditional Headers for Blob Service Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/specifying-conditional-headers-for-blob-service-operations).

### Example


```python
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://azure.local
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://azure.local"
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.FileAndDirectoryOperationsApi(api_client)
    filesystem = 'filesystem_example' # str | The filesystem identifier.
    path = 'path_example' # str | The file or directory path.
    action = 'action_example' # str | The action must be \"append\" to upload data to be appended to a file, \"flush\" to flush previously uploaded data to a file, \"setProperties\" to set the properties of a file or directory, or \"setAccessControl\" to set the owner, group, permissions, or access control list for a file or directory.  Note that Hierarchical Namespace must be enabled for the account in order to use access control.  Also note that the Access Control List (ACL) includes permissions for the owner, owning group, and others, so the x-ms-permissions and x-ms-acl request headers are mutually exclusive.
    x_ms_client_request_id = 'x_ms_client_request_id_example' # str | A UUID recorded in the analytics logs for troubleshooting and correlation. (optional)
    timeout = 56 # int | An optional operation timeout value in seconds. The period begins when the request is received by the service. If the timeout value elapses before the operation completes, the operation fails. (optional)
    x_ms_date = 'x_ms_date_example' # str | Specifies the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the request.  This is required when using shared key authorization. (optional)
    x_ms_version = 'x_ms_version_example' # str | Specifies the version of the REST protocol used for processing the request. This is required when using shared key authorization. (optional)
    position = 56 # int | This parameter allows the caller to upload data in parallel and control the order in which it is appended to the file.  It is required when uploading data to be appended to the file and when flushing previously uploaded data to the file.  The value must be the position where the data is to be appended.  Uploaded data is not immediately flushed, or written, to the file.  To flush, the previously uploaded data must be contiguous, the position parameter must be specified and equal to the length of the file after all data has been written, and there must not be a request entity body included with the request. (optional)
    retain_uncommitted_data = True # bool | Valid only for flush operations.  If \"true\", uncommitted data is retained after the flush operation completes; otherwise, the uncommitted data is deleted after the flush operation.  The default is false.  Data at offsets less than the specified position are written to the file when flush succeeds, but this optional parameter allows data after the flush position to be retained for a future flush operation. (optional)
    close = True # bool | Azure Storage Events allow applications to receive notifications when files change. When Azure Storage Events are enabled, a file changed event is raised. This event has a property indicating whether this is the final change to distinguish the difference between an intermediate flush to a file stream and the final close of a file stream. The close query parameter is valid only when the action is \"flush\" and change notifications are enabled. If the value of close is \"true\" and the flush operation completes successfully, the service raises a file change notification with a property indicating that this is the final update (the file stream has been closed). If \"false\" a change notification is raised indicating the file has changed. The default is false. This query parameter is set to true by the Hadoop ABFS driver to indicate that the file stream has been closed.\" (optional)
    content_length = 56 # int | Required for \"Append Data\" and \"Flush Data\".  Must be 0 for \"Flush Data\".  Must be the length of the request content in bytes for \"Append Data\". (optional)
    content_md5 = 'content_md5_example' # str | Optional. An MD5 hash of the request content. This header is valid on \"Append\" and \"Flush\" operations. This hash is used to verify the integrity of the request content during transport. When this header is specified, the storage service compares the hash of the content that has arrived with this header value. If the two hashes do not match, the operation will fail with error code 400 (Bad Request). Note that this MD5 hash is not stored with the file. This header is associated with the request content, and not with the stored content of the file itself. (optional)
    x_ms_lease_id = 'x_ms_lease_id_example' # str | The lease ID must be specified if there is an active lease. (optional)
    x_ms_cache_control = 'x_ms_cache_control_example' # str | Optional and only valid for flush and set properties operations.  The service stores this value and includes it in the \"Cache-Control\" response header for \"Read File\" operations. (optional)
    x_ms_content_type = 'x_ms_content_type_example' # str | Optional and only valid for flush and set properties operations.  The service stores this value and includes it in the \"Content-Type\" response header for \"Read File\" operations. (optional)
    x_ms_content_disposition = 'x_ms_content_disposition_example' # str | Optional and only valid for flush and set properties operations.  The service stores this value and includes it in the \"Content-Disposition\" response header for \"Read File\" operations. (optional)
    x_ms_content_encoding = 'x_ms_content_encoding_example' # str | Optional and only valid for flush and set properties operations.  The service stores this value and includes it in the \"Content-Encoding\" response header for \"Read File\" operations. (optional)
    x_ms_content_language = 'x_ms_content_language_example' # str | Optional and only valid for flush and set properties operations.  The service stores this value and includes it in the \"Content-Language\" response header for \"Read File\" operations. (optional)
    x_ms_content_md5 = 'x_ms_content_md5_example' # str | Optional and only valid for \"Flush & Set Properties\" operations.  The service stores this value and includes it in the \"Content-Md5\" response header for \"Read & Get Properties\" operations. If this property is not specified on the request, then the property will be cleared for the file. Subsequent calls to \"Read & Get Properties\" will not return this property unless it is explicitly set on that file again. (optional)
    x_ms_properties = 'x_ms_properties_example' # str | Optional.  User-defined properties to be stored with the file or directory, in the format of a comma-separated list of name and value pairs \"n1=v1, n2=v2, ...\", where each value is a base64 encoded string. Note that the string may only contain ASCII characters in the ISO-8859-1 character set. Valid only for the setProperties operation. If the file or directory exists, any properties not included in the list will be removed.  All properties are removed if the header is omitted.  To merge new and existing properties, first get all existing properties and the current E-Tag, then make a conditional request with the E-Tag and include values for all properties. (optional)
    x_ms_owner = 'x_ms_owner_example' # str | Optional and valid only for the setAccessControl operation. Sets the owner of the file or directory. (optional)
    x_ms_group = 'x_ms_group_example' # str | Optional and valid only for the setAccessControl operation. Sets the owning group of the file or directory. (optional)
    x_ms_permissions = 'x_ms_permissions_example' # str | Optional and only valid if Hierarchical Namespace is enabled for the account. Sets POSIX access permissions for the file owner, the file owning group, and others. Each class may be granted read, write, or execute permission.  The sticky bit is also supported.  Both symbolic (rwxrw-rw-) and 4-digit octal notation (e.g. 0766) are supported. Invalid in conjunction with x-ms-acl. (optional)
    x_ms_acl = 'x_ms_acl_example' # str | Optional and valid only for the setAccessControl operation. Sets POSIX access control rights on files and directories. The value is a comma-separated list of access control entries that fully replaces the existing access control list (ACL).  Each access control entry (ACE) consists of a scope, a type, a user or group identifier, and permissions in the format \"[scope:][type]:[id]:[permissions]\". The scope must be \"default\" to indicate the ACE belongs to the default ACL for a directory; otherwise scope is implicit and the ACE belongs to the access ACL.  There are four ACE types: \"user\" grants rights to the owner or a named user, \"group\" grants rights to the owning group or a named group, \"mask\" restricts rights granted to named users and the members of groups, and \"other\" grants rights to all users not found in any of the other entries. The user or group identifier is omitted for entries of type \"mask\" and \"other\".  The user or group identifier is also omitted for the owner and owning group.  The permission field is a 3-character sequence where the first character is 'r' to grant read access, the second character is 'w' to grant write access, and the third character is 'x' to grant execute permission.  If access is not granted, the '-' character is used to denote that the permission is denied. For example, the following ACL grants read, write, and execute rights to the file owner and john.doe@contoso, the read right to the owning group, and nothing to everyone else: \"user::rwx,user:john.doe@contoso:rwx,group::r--,other::---,mask=rwx\". Invalid in conjunction with x-ms-permissions. (optional)
    if_match = 'if_match_example' # str | Optional for Flush Data and Set Properties, but invalid for Append Data.  An ETag value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource's ETag matches the value specified. The ETag must be specified in quotes. (optional)
    if_none_match = 'if_none_match_example' # str | Optional for Flush Data and Set Properties, but invalid for Append Data.  An ETag value or the special wildcard (\"*\") value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource's ETag does not match the value specified. The ETag must be specified in quotes. (optional)
    if_modified_since = 'if_modified_since_example' # str | Optional for Flush Data and Set Properties, but invalid for Append Data. A date and time value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource has been modified since the specified date and time. (optional)
    if_unmodified_since = 'if_unmodified_since_example' # str | Optional for Flush Data and Set Properties, but invalid for Append Data. A date and time value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource has not been modified since the specified date and time. (optional)

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **filesystem** | **str**| The filesystem identifier. | 
 **path** | **str**| The file or directory path. | 
 **action** | **str**| The action must be \&quot;append\&quot; to upload data to be appended to a file, \&quot;flush\&quot; to flush previously uploaded data to a file, \&quot;setProperties\&quot; to set the properties of a file or directory, or \&quot;setAccessControl\&quot; to set the owner, group, permissions, or access control list for a file or directory.  Note that Hierarchical Namespace must be enabled for the account in order to use access control.  Also note that the Access Control List (ACL) includes permissions for the owner, owning group, and others, so the x-ms-permissions and x-ms-acl request headers are mutually exclusive. | 
 **x_ms_client_request_id** | **str**| A UUID recorded in the analytics logs for troubleshooting and correlation. | [optional] 
 **timeout** | **int**| An optional operation timeout value in seconds. The period begins when the request is received by the service. If the timeout value elapses before the operation completes, the operation fails. | [optional] 
 **x_ms_date** | **str**| Specifies the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the request.  This is required when using shared key authorization. | [optional] 
 **x_ms_version** | **str**| Specifies the version of the REST protocol used for processing the request. This is required when using shared key authorization. | [optional] 
 **position** | **int**| This parameter allows the caller to upload data in parallel and control the order in which it is appended to the file.  It is required when uploading data to be appended to the file and when flushing previously uploaded data to the file.  The value must be the position where the data is to be appended.  Uploaded data is not immediately flushed, or written, to the file.  To flush, the previously uploaded data must be contiguous, the position parameter must be specified and equal to the length of the file after all data has been written, and there must not be a request entity body included with the request. | [optional] 
 **retain_uncommitted_data** | **bool**| Valid only for flush operations.  If \&quot;true\&quot;, uncommitted data is retained after the flush operation completes; otherwise, the uncommitted data is deleted after the flush operation.  The default is false.  Data at offsets less than the specified position are written to the file when flush succeeds, but this optional parameter allows data after the flush position to be retained for a future flush operation. | [optional] 
 **close** | **bool**| Azure Storage Events allow applications to receive notifications when files change. When Azure Storage Events are enabled, a file changed event is raised. This event has a property indicating whether this is the final change to distinguish the difference between an intermediate flush to a file stream and the final close of a file stream. The close query parameter is valid only when the action is \&quot;flush\&quot; and change notifications are enabled. If the value of close is \&quot;true\&quot; and the flush operation completes successfully, the service raises a file change notification with a property indicating that this is the final update (the file stream has been closed). If \&quot;false\&quot; a change notification is raised indicating the file has changed. The default is false. This query parameter is set to true by the Hadoop ABFS driver to indicate that the file stream has been closed.\&quot; | [optional] 
 **content_length** | **int**| Required for \&quot;Append Data\&quot; and \&quot;Flush Data\&quot;.  Must be 0 for \&quot;Flush Data\&quot;.  Must be the length of the request content in bytes for \&quot;Append Data\&quot;. | [optional] 
 **content_md5** | **str**| Optional. An MD5 hash of the request content. This header is valid on \&quot;Append\&quot; and \&quot;Flush\&quot; operations. This hash is used to verify the integrity of the request content during transport. When this header is specified, the storage service compares the hash of the content that has arrived with this header value. If the two hashes do not match, the operation will fail with error code 400 (Bad Request). Note that this MD5 hash is not stored with the file. This header is associated with the request content, and not with the stored content of the file itself. | [optional] 
 **x_ms_lease_id** | **str**| The lease ID must be specified if there is an active lease. | [optional] 
 **x_ms_cache_control** | **str**| Optional and only valid for flush and set properties operations.  The service stores this value and includes it in the \&quot;Cache-Control\&quot; response header for \&quot;Read File\&quot; operations. | [optional] 
 **x_ms_content_type** | **str**| Optional and only valid for flush and set properties operations.  The service stores this value and includes it in the \&quot;Content-Type\&quot; response header for \&quot;Read File\&quot; operations. | [optional] 
 **x_ms_content_disposition** | **str**| Optional and only valid for flush and set properties operations.  The service stores this value and includes it in the \&quot;Content-Disposition\&quot; response header for \&quot;Read File\&quot; operations. | [optional] 
 **x_ms_content_encoding** | **str**| Optional and only valid for flush and set properties operations.  The service stores this value and includes it in the \&quot;Content-Encoding\&quot; response header for \&quot;Read File\&quot; operations. | [optional] 
 **x_ms_content_language** | **str**| Optional and only valid for flush and set properties operations.  The service stores this value and includes it in the \&quot;Content-Language\&quot; response header for \&quot;Read File\&quot; operations. | [optional] 
 **x_ms_content_md5** | **str**| Optional and only valid for \&quot;Flush &amp; Set Properties\&quot; operations.  The service stores this value and includes it in the \&quot;Content-Md5\&quot; response header for \&quot;Read &amp; Get Properties\&quot; operations. If this property is not specified on the request, then the property will be cleared for the file. Subsequent calls to \&quot;Read &amp; Get Properties\&quot; will not return this property unless it is explicitly set on that file again. | [optional] 
 **x_ms_properties** | **str**| Optional.  User-defined properties to be stored with the file or directory, in the format of a comma-separated list of name and value pairs \&quot;n1&#x3D;v1, n2&#x3D;v2, ...\&quot;, where each value is a base64 encoded string. Note that the string may only contain ASCII characters in the ISO-8859-1 character set. Valid only for the setProperties operation. If the file or directory exists, any properties not included in the list will be removed.  All properties are removed if the header is omitted.  To merge new and existing properties, first get all existing properties and the current E-Tag, then make a conditional request with the E-Tag and include values for all properties. | [optional] 
 **x_ms_owner** | **str**| Optional and valid only for the setAccessControl operation. Sets the owner of the file or directory. | [optional] 
 **x_ms_group** | **str**| Optional and valid only for the setAccessControl operation. Sets the owning group of the file or directory. | [optional] 
 **x_ms_permissions** | **str**| Optional and only valid if Hierarchical Namespace is enabled for the account. Sets POSIX access permissions for the file owner, the file owning group, and others. Each class may be granted read, write, or execute permission.  The sticky bit is also supported.  Both symbolic (rwxrw-rw-) and 4-digit octal notation (e.g. 0766) are supported. Invalid in conjunction with x-ms-acl. | [optional] 
 **x_ms_acl** | **str**| Optional and valid only for the setAccessControl operation. Sets POSIX access control rights on files and directories. The value is a comma-separated list of access control entries that fully replaces the existing access control list (ACL).  Each access control entry (ACE) consists of a scope, a type, a user or group identifier, and permissions in the format \&quot;[scope:][type]:[id]:[permissions]\&quot;. The scope must be \&quot;default\&quot; to indicate the ACE belongs to the default ACL for a directory; otherwise scope is implicit and the ACE belongs to the access ACL.  There are four ACE types: \&quot;user\&quot; grants rights to the owner or a named user, \&quot;group\&quot; grants rights to the owning group or a named group, \&quot;mask\&quot; restricts rights granted to named users and the members of groups, and \&quot;other\&quot; grants rights to all users not found in any of the other entries. The user or group identifier is omitted for entries of type \&quot;mask\&quot; and \&quot;other\&quot;.  The user or group identifier is also omitted for the owner and owning group.  The permission field is a 3-character sequence where the first character is &#39;r&#39; to grant read access, the second character is &#39;w&#39; to grant write access, and the third character is &#39;x&#39; to grant execute permission.  If access is not granted, the &#39;-&#39; character is used to denote that the permission is denied. For example, the following ACL grants read, write, and execute rights to the file owner and john.doe@contoso, the read right to the owning group, and nothing to everyone else: \&quot;user::rwx,user:john.doe@contoso:rwx,group::r--,other::---,mask&#x3D;rwx\&quot;. Invalid in conjunction with x-ms-permissions. | [optional] 
 **if_match** | **str**| Optional for Flush Data and Set Properties, but invalid for Append Data.  An ETag value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource&#39;s ETag matches the value specified. The ETag must be specified in quotes. | [optional] 
 **if_none_match** | **str**| Optional for Flush Data and Set Properties, but invalid for Append Data.  An ETag value or the special wildcard (\&quot;*\&quot;) value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource&#39;s ETag does not match the value specified. The ETag must be specified in quotes. | [optional] 
 **if_modified_since** | **str**| Optional for Flush Data and Set Properties, but invalid for Append Data. A date and time value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource has been modified since the specified date and time. | [optional] 
 **if_unmodified_since** | **str**| Optional for Flush Data and Set Properties, but invalid for Append Data. A date and time value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource has not been modified since the specified date and time. | [optional] 
 **request_body** | **object**| Valid only for append operations.  The data to be uploaded and appended to the file. | [optional]
