# **certificate_cancel_deletion**
> certificate_cancel_deletion(thumbprint_algorithm, thumbprint, api_version, timeout=timeout, client_request_id=client_request_id, return_client_request_id=return_client_request_id, ocp_date=ocp_date)

Cancels a failed deletion of a certificate from the specified account.

If you try to delete a certificate that is being used by a pool or compute node, the status of the certificate changes to deleteFailed. If you decide that you want to continue using the certificate, you can use this operation to set the status of the certificate back to active. If you intend to delete the certificate, you do not need to run this operation after the deletion failed. You must make sure that the certificate is not being used by any resources, and then you can try again to delete the certificate.

# **certificate_delete**
> certificate_delete(thumbprint_algorithm, thumbprint, api_version, timeout=timeout, client_request_id=client_request_id, return_client_request_id=return_client_request_id, ocp_date=ocp_date)

Deletes a certificate from the specified account.

You cannot delete a certificate if a resource (pool or compute node) is using it. Before you can delete a certificate, you must therefore make sure that the certificate is not associated with any existing pools, the certificate is not installed on any compute nodes (even if you remove a certificate from a pool, it is not removed from existing compute nodes in that pool until they restart), and no running tasks depend on the certificate. If you try to delete a certificate that is in use, the deletion fails. The certificate status changes to deleteFailed. You can use Cancel Delete Certificate to set the status back to active if you decide that you want to continue using the certificate.

### HTTP response details

| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
**200** | A response containing the list of certificates. |  * ETag - The ETag HTTP response header. This is an opaque string. You can use it to detect whether the resource has changed between requests. In particular, you can pass the ETag to one of the If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since, If-Match or If-None-Match headers. <br>  * client-request-id - The client-request-id provided by the client during the request. This will be returned only if the return-client-request-id parameter was set to true. <br>  * Last-Modified - The time at which the resource was last modified. <br>  * request-id - A unique identifier for the request that was made to the Batch service. If a request is consistently failing and you have verified that the request is properly formulated, you may use this value to report the error to Microsoft. In your report, include the value of this request ID, the approximate time that the request was made, the Batch account against which the request was made, and the region that account resides in. <br>  |
**0** | The error from the Batch service. |  -  |
