# **job_add**
> job_add(api_version, job, timeout=timeout, client_request_id=client_request_id, return_client_request_id=return_client_request_id, ocp_date=ocp_date)

Adds a job to the specified account.

The Batch service supports two ways to control the work done as part of a job. In the first approach, the user specifies a Job Manager task. The Batch service launches this task when it is ready to start the job. The Job Manager task controls all other tasks that run under this job, by using the Task APIs. In the second approach, the user directly controls the execution of tasks under an active job, by using the Task APIs. Also note: when naming jobs, avoid including sensitive information such as user names or secret project names. This information may appear in telemetry logs accessible to Microsoft Support engineers.

# **job_delete**
> job_delete(job_id, api_version, timeout=timeout, client_request_id=client_request_id, return_client_request_id=return_client_request_id, ocp_date=ocp_date, if_match=if_match, if_none_match=if_none_match, if_modified_since=if_modified_since, if_unmodified_since=if_unmodified_since)

Deletes a job.

Deleting a job also deletes all tasks that are part of that job, and all job statistics. This also overrides the retention period for task data; that is, if the job contains tasks which are still retained on compute nodes, the Batch services deletes those tasks' working directories and all their contents.  When a Delete Job request is received, the Batch service sets the job to the deleting state. All update operations on a job that is in deleting state will fail with status code 409 (Conflict), with additional information indicating that the job is being deleted.

# **job_disable**
> job_disable(job_id, api_version, job_disable_parameter, timeout=timeout, client_request_id=client_request_id, return_client_request_id=return_client_request_id, ocp_date=ocp_date, if_match=if_match, if_none_match=if_none_match, if_modified_since=if_modified_since, if_unmodified_since=if_unmodified_since)

Disables the specified job, preventing new tasks from running.

The Batch Service immediately moves the job to the disabling state. Batch then uses the disableTasks parameter to determine what to do with the currently running tasks of the job. The job remains in the disabling state until the disable operation is completed and all tasks have been dealt with according to the disableTasks option; the job then moves to the disabled state. No new tasks are started under the job until it moves back to active state. If you try to disable a job that is in any state other than active, disabling, or disabled, the request fails with status code 409.

# **job_enable**

Enables the specified job, allowing new tasks to run.

When you call this API, the Batch service sets a disabled job to the enabling state. After the this operation is completed, the job moves to the active state, and scheduling of new tasks under the job resumes. The Batch service does not allow a task to remain in the active state for more than 180 days. Therefore, if you enable a job containing active tasks which were added more than 180 days ago, those tasks will not run.

Lists the execution status of the Job Preparation and Job Release task for the specified job across the compute nodes where the job has run.

This API returns the Job Preparation and Job Release task status on all compute nodes that have run the Job Preparation or Job Release task. This includes nodes which have since been removed from the pool. If this API is invoked on a job which has no Job Preparation or Job Release task, the Batch service returns HTTP status code 409 (Conflict) with an error code of JobPreparationTaskNotSpecified.

# **job_terminate**
> job_terminate(job_id, api_version, timeout=timeout, client_request_id=client_request_id, return_client_request_id=return_client_request_id, ocp_date=ocp_date, if_match=if_match, if_none_match=if_none_match, if_modified_since=if_modified_since, if_unmodified_since=if_unmodified_since, job_terminate_parameter=job_terminate_parameter)

Terminates the specified job, marking it as completed.

When a Terminate Job request is received, the Batch service sets the job to the terminating state. The Batch service then terminates any running tasks associated with the job and runs any required job release tasks. Then the job moves into the completed state. If there are any tasks in the job in the active state, they will remain in the active state. Once a job is terminated, new tasks cannot be added and any remaining active tasks will not be scheduled.

# **job_update**
> job_update(job_id, api_version, job_update_parameter, timeout=timeout, client_request_id=client_request_id, return_client_request_id=return_client_request_id, ocp_date=ocp_date, if_match=if_match, if_none_match=if_none_match, if_modified_since=if_modified_since, if_unmodified_since=if_unmodified_since)

Updates the properties of the specified job.

This fully replaces all the updatable properties of the job. For example, if the job has constraints associated with it and if constraints is not specified with this request, then the Batch service will remove the existing constraints.

### Example

* Api Key Authentication (api_key):
* OAuth Authentication (azure_auth):

```python
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.models.job_update_parameter import JobUpdateParameter
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://azure.local
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://azure.local"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure API key authorization: api_key
configuration.api_key['api_key'] = os.environ["API_KEY"]

# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['api_key'] = 'Bearer'

configuration.access_token = os.environ["ACCESS_TOKEN"]

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.JobsApi(api_client)
    job_id = 'job_id_example' # str | The ID of the job whose properties you want to update.
    api_version = 'api_version_example' # str | Client API Version.
    job_update_parameter = openapi_client.JobUpdateParameter() # JobUpdateParameter | The parameters for the request.
    timeout = 30 # int | The maximum time that the server can spend processing the request, in seconds. The default is 30 seconds. (optional) (default to 30)
    client_request_id = 'client_request_id_example' # str | The caller-generated request identity, in the form of a GUID with no decoration such as curly braces, e.g. 9C4D50EE-2D56-4CD3-8152-34347DC9F2B0. (optional)
    return_client_request_id = False # bool | Whether the server should return the client-request-id in the response. (optional) (default to False)
    ocp_date = 'ocp_date_example' # str | The time the request was issued. Client libraries typically set this to the current system clock time; set it explicitly if you are calling the REST API directly. (optional)
    if_match = 'if_match_example' # str | An ETag value associated with the version of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource's current ETag on the service exactly matches the value specified by the client. (optional)
    if_none_match = 'if_none_match_example' # str | An ETag value associated with the version of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource's current ETag on the service does not match the value specified by the client. (optional)
    if_modified_since = 'if_modified_since_example' # str | A timestamp indicating the last modified time of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource on the service has been modified since the specified time. (optional)
    if_unmodified_since = 'if_unmodified_since_example' # str | A timestamp indicating the last modified time of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource on the service has not been modified since the specified time. (optional)

    try:
        # Updates the properties of the specified job.
        api_instance.job_update(job_id, api_version, job_update_parameter, timeout=timeout, client_request_id=client_request_id, return_client_request_id=return_client_request_id, ocp_date=ocp_date, if_match=if_match, if_none_match=if_none_match, if_modified_since=if_modified_since, if_unmodified_since=if_unmodified_since)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling JobsApi->job_update: %s\n" % e)
