**end_time** | **datetime** | This property is set only if the task is in the Completed state. | [optional] 
**exit_code** | **int** | This parameter is returned only if the task is in the completed state.

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.job_release_task_execution_information import JobReleaseTaskExecutionInformation

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of JobReleaseTaskExecutionInformation from a JSON string
job_release_task_execution_information_instance = JobReleaseTaskExecutionInformation.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(JobReleaseTaskExecutionInformation.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
job_release_task_execution_information_dict = job_release_task_execution_information_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of JobReleaseTaskExecutionInformation from a dict
job_release_task_execution_information_from_dict = JobReleaseTaskExecutionInformation.from_dict(job_release_task_execution_information_dict)
