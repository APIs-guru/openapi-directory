# Schedule


## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**do_not_run_after** | **datetime** | If you do not specify a doNotRunAfter time, and you are creating a recurring job schedule, the job schedule will remain active until you explicitly terminate it. | [optional] 
**do_not_run_until** | **datetime** | If you do not specify a doNotRunUntil time, the schedule becomes ready to create jobs immediately. | [optional] 
**recurrence_interval** | **str** | Because a job schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given time, if it is time to create a new job under a job schedule, but the previous job is still running, the Batch service will not create the new job until the previous job finishes. If the previous job does not finish within the startWindow period of the new recurrenceInterval, then no new job will be scheduled for that interval. For recurring jobs, you should normally specify a jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification. If you do not use jobManagerTask, you will need an external process to monitor when jobs are created, add tasks to the jobs and terminate the jobs ready for the next recurrence. The default is that the schedule does not recur: one job is created, within the startWindow after the doNotRunUntil time, and the schedule is complete as soon as that job finishes. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). | [optional] 
**start_window** | **str** | If a job is not created within the startWindow interval, then the &#39;opportunity&#39; is lost; no job will be created until the next recurrence of the schedule. If the schedule is recurring, and the startWindow is longer than the recurrence interval, then this is equivalent to an infinite startWindow, because the job that is &#39;due&#39; in one recurrenceInterval is not carried forward into the next recurrence interval. The default is infinite. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.schedule import Schedule

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Schedule from a JSON string
schedule_instance = Schedule.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(Schedule.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
schedule_dict = schedule_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Schedule from a dict
schedule_from_dict = Schedule.from_dict(schedule_dict)
```
