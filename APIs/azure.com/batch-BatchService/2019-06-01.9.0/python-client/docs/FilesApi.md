Deletes the specified file from the Compute Node.

### Example

* Api Key Authentication (api_key):
* OAuth Authentication (azure_auth):

```python

from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://azure.local
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://azure.local"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure API key authorization: api_key

# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['api_key'] = 'Bearer'

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:

    recursive = True # bool | Whether to delete children of a directory. If the filePath parameter represents a directory instead of a file, you can set recursive to true to delete the directory and all of the files and subdirectories in it. If recursive is false then the directory must be empty or deletion will fail. (optional)
    timeout = 30 # int | The maximum time that the server can spend processing the request, in seconds. The default is 30 seconds. (optional) (default to 30)
    client_request_id = 'client_request_id_example' # str | The caller-generated request identity, in the form of a GUID with no decoration such as curly braces, e.g. 9C4D50EE-2D56-4CD3-8152-34347DC9F2B0. (optional)
    return_client_request_id = False # bool | Whether the server should return the client-request-id in the response. (optional) (default to False)
    ocp_date = 'ocp_date_example' # str | The time the request was issued. Client libraries typically set this to the current system clock time; set it explicitly if you are calling the REST API directly. (optional)

This will be returned only if the return-client-request-id parameter was set to true. <br>  * Last-Modified - The time at which the resource was last modified. <br>  * request-id - A unique identifier for the request that was made to the Batch service. If a request is consistently failing and you have verified that the request is properly formulated, you may use this value to report the error to Microsoft. In your report, include the value of this request ID, the approximate time that the request was made, the Batch Account against which the request was made, and the region that Account resides in. <br>  |
