------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**activated** | **bool** | Indicates if the feature is enabled. | [optional] 
**mode** | **bool** | An exchangeable phrase list feature are serves as single feature to the LUIS underlying training algorithm. It is used as a lexicon lookup feature where its value is 1 if the lexicon contains a given word or 0 if it doesnâ€™t. Think of an exchangeable as a synonyms list. A non-exchangeable phrase list feature has all the phrases in the list serve as separate features to the underlying training algorithm.

You can think of the non-exchangeable phrase list feature as an additional bag of words that you are willing to add to LUIS existing vocabulary features. Think of a non-exchangeable as set of different words. Default value is true. | [optional]
