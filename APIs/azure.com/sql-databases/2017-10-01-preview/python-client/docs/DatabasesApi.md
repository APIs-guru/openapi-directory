Upgrades a data warehouse.

### Example


```python

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://management.azure.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://management.azure.com"
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.DatabasesApi(api_client)
    resource_group_name = 'resource_group_name_example' # str | The name of the resource group that contains the resource. You can obtain this value from the Azure Resource Manager API or the portal.
    server_name = 'server_name_example' # str | The name of the server.
    database_name = 'database_name_example' # str | The name of the database to be upgraded.
    subscription_id = 'subscription_id_example' # str | The subscription ID that identifies an Azure subscription.
    api_version = 'api_version_example' # str | The API version to use for the request.

    try:
        api_instance.databases_upgrade_data_warehouse(resource_group_name, server_name, database_name, subscription_id, api_version)
    except Exception as e:
