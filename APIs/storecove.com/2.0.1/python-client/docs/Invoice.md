**allowance_charges** | [**List[AllowanceCharge]**](AllowanceCharge.md) | An array of allowance charges. | [optional] 
**amount_including_vat** | **float** | amountIncludingVat is important because of rounding differences. In many invoices, the sum of the line item amounts excluding VAT and the VAT amounts is not equal to first summing the line items without VAT, and then applying VAT. The difference is automatically calculated and included in the electronic invoice, so the receiving accounting package can process the electronic invoice without problems. |

In this mode, the VAT identifier of the sender will not be the default VAT identifier, but the one that matches with the country of the receiving consumer, if that additional VAT identifier for that country is available. These additional VAT identifiers need to be added to the sending LegalEntity by Storecove, so if you need to send invoices in this mode, please contact us. | [optional] [default to False]

**invoice_number** | **str** | The invoice number you assigned to the invoice. The invoiceNumber should be unique for the legalEntityId and year of the issueDate. This means invoice numbers can be reused in different years, as is customary in some countries. | 
**invoice_period** | **str** | The period (or specific date) to which the invoice applies. Format: yyyy-mm-dd - yyyy-mm-dd. | [optional] 
**invoice_type** | **str** | DEPRECATED. Do not use. This field is available for legacy reasons only. If you want to send a regular invoice (aka UBL type &#39;380&#39;), make sure you have a positive invoice amount. For a credit note (aka UBL type &#39;381&#39;), simply provide a negative invoice amount. If you, in addition to a negative invoice amount, also specify a billingReferences, your invoice will become a corrective invoice (aka UBL type &#39;384&#39;). If your invoice is not sent in the UBL syntax, Storecove will provide the appropriate type for the syntax the invoice is sent in. | [optional] [default to '380']

**issue_reasons** | **List[str]** | An array reasons for issuing the invoice. | [optional]

**order_reference** | **str** | DEPRECATED. Use a reference object with a documentType &#39;purchase_order&#39;. A reference to an order for this invoice, assigned by the buyer. Note that this often is a key field, since many receivers of invoices will use this field to automatically match the invoice to an order they placed. Many receivers refuse invoices that cannot be automatically matched, in particular government agencies. So it is highly recommended to fill this field whenever possible. | [optional]

**preferred_invoice_type** | **str** | In auto mode, the choice between invoice or creditnote is made by Storecove based on what is appropriate for the receiver and the receiver country, in combination with the invoice amount sign. If you wish to state a preference, use this field. It is not guaranteed that the preference will be used, since it depends also on the receiver&#39;s document capabilities. | [optional] [default to 'autodetect']
**prepaid_amount** | **float** | The amount already paid. | [optional] 
**price_mode** | **str** | The price mode. This is used to determine whether the prices are net or gross.

**references** | [**List[Reference]**](Reference.md) | An array of references to other documents. Note that many syntaxes do not support multiple references of the same type in which case they will be concatenated with &#39;,&#39;. Also, not all syntaxes support all documentTypes. | [optional]

**tax_exempt_reason** | **str** | DEPRECATED. Use Tax/category and specify this per invoice line. If you do specify this field, it will be applied to all invoice lines and it is an error to specify a Tax/category at the invoice line level. This field holds the reason no tax is present in the invoice. Note that this is an invoice level field and you cannot specify it per invoice line. This field is mandatory unless tax is present in the invoice. | [optional] 
**tax_point_date** | **str** | The tax date is the date on which the supply of goods or of services was made or completed or the date on which the payment on account was made insofar as that date can be determined and differs from the date of the issue of the invoice.

**tax_system** | **str** | The tax system used for the invoice. The system &#39;tax_line_percentages&#39; is preferred, but for historic purposes &#39;tax_line_amounts&#39; is supported and the default. Since not all invoice formats that we are required to send support &#39;tax_line_amounts&#39; we will need to convert the invoice to the &#39;tax_line_percentags&#39; system if we are forced to send the invoice in that tax system. Note that an invoice must always contain tax information, even if that is 0% or an item or sender is exempt or tax is completely outside scope. In that case, use the correct tax categories (see &lt;&lt;_openapi_tax&gt;&gt;) | [optional] [default to 'amounts']
**taxes_duties_fees** | [**List[Tax]**](Tax.md) | An array of taxes, duties and fees for this invoice. At this moment, the only invoice level tax allowed is the Italian &#39;â‚¬2 bollo virtuale&#39; | [optional]

**x2y** | **str** | The type of entities the document is sent from/to: b2b (business-to-business), b2g (business-to-government) or b2c (business-to-consumer). This field does not have a default, but it in mose cases it will be treated as b2b. Only when you explicitly specify b2g or b2c OR when it is clear from the context will a different value be used. For instance, when we see the document is being routed to DE:LWID or NL:OINO number, this tells us it is b2g. But in many cases we are unable to determine this and so it is best to always specify this field. Note that b2b_sez is for use inside India only. | [optional] [default to 'b2b']

from openapi_client.models.invoice import Invoice

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Invoice from a JSON string
invoice_instance = Invoice.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(Invoice.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
invoice_dict = invoice_instance.to_dict()
