                It can contain an optional front matter. For example


                ```markdown

                ---

                title: Hello, World!

                published: true

                tags: discuss, help

                date: 20190701T10:00Z

                series: Hello series

                canonical_url: https://example.com/blog/hello

                cover_image: article_published_cover_image

                ---

                ```


                `date`, `series` and `canonical_url` are optional.

                `date` is the publication date-time

                `series` is the name of the series the article belongs to

                `canonical_url` is the canonical URL of the article

                `cover_image` is the main image of the article


                *If the markdown contains a front matter, it will take precedence

                on the equivalent params given in the payload.*

                It can contain an optional front matter. For example


                ```markdown

                ---

                title: Hello, World!

                published: true

                tags: discuss, help

                date: 20190701T10:00Z

                series: Hello series

                canonical_url: https://example.com/blog/hello

                cover_image: article_published_cover_image

                ---

                ```


                `date`, `series` and `canonical_url` are optional.

                `date` is the publication date-time

                `series` is the name of the series the article belongs to

                `canonical_url` is the canonical URL of the article

                `cover_image` is the main image of the article
