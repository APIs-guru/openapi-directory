# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of OBStandingOrder6Basic from a JSON string
ob_standing_order6_basic_instance = OBStandingOrder6Basic.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(OBStandingOrder6Basic.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
ob_standing_order6_basic_dict = ob_standing_order6_basic_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of OBStandingOrder6Basic from a dict
