Get International Scheduled Payments

### Example

* OAuth Authentication (TPPOAuth2Security):

```python
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.models.ob_write_international_scheduled_response6 import OBWriteInternationalScheduledResponse6
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://openbanking.org.uk
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://openbanking.org.uk"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

configuration.access_token = os.environ["ACCESS_TOKEN"]

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.InternationalScheduledPaymentsApi(api_client)
    international_scheduled_payment_id = 'international_scheduled_payment_id_example' # str | InternationalScheduledPaymentId
    authorization = 'authorization_example' # str | An Authorisation Token as per https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750
    x_fapi_auth_date = 'x_fapi_auth_date_example' # str | The time when the PSU last logged in with the TPP.  All dates in the HTTP headers are represented as RFC 7231 Full Dates. An example is below:  Sun, 10 Sep 2017 19:43:31 UTC (optional)
    x_fapi_customer_ip_address = 'x_fapi_customer_ip_address_example' # str | The PSU's IP address if the PSU is currently logged in with the TPP. (optional)
    x_fapi_interaction_id = 'x_fapi_interaction_id_example' # str | An RFC4122 UID used as a correlation id. (optional)
    x_customer_user_agent = 'x_customer_user_agent_example' # str | Indicates the user-agent that the PSU is using. (optional)

    try:
        # Get International Scheduled Payments
        api_response = api_instance.get_international_scheduled_payments_international_scheduled_payment_id(international_scheduled_payment_id, authorization, x_fapi_auth_date=x_fapi_auth_date, x_fapi_customer_ip_address=x_fapi_customer_ip_address, x_fapi_interaction_id=x_fapi_interaction_id, x_customer_user_agent=x_customer_user_agent)
        print("The response of InternationalScheduledPaymentsApi->get_international_scheduled_payments_international_scheduled_payment_id:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
