  description: "With our API, you can easily access many SIGNL4 functions via HTTP requests. It is based on REST and fulfills a similar purpose for which SDKs were used very often in the past.<br />\r

    Example usage scenarios are the integration in third party systems for triggering alarms to your team or on-call duty based on shift planning systems.<br/></br>\r

    The API is always used in the context of your SIGNL4 team, i. e. you must log in with your SIGNL4 account and give your API client the authorization to access your team programmatically on your behalf (constent grant).<br />\r

    At the moment there are several certified API clients, e.g. [Microsoft Flow](https://emea.flow.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/shared_signl4/signl4-derdack/) or [Amazon Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/Derdack-GmbH-SIGNL4/dp/B077BQ79T3). Registration of your personal API client is currently possible on request.<br />\r

    Don't hesitate to [contact us](https://www.signl4.com/feedback-we-love-hear-from-you/) and you'll get your client_id and client_secret required for accessing the SIGNL4 API after user login and consent grant.<br />\r

    Authentication is based on OpenID Connect and the [Authorization Code Flow](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth).<br /><br />\r

    The base URL of the API is [https://connect.signl4.com/api/](https://connect.signl4.com/api/).<br />\r
