    The PeerTube API is built on HTTP(S) and is RESTful. You can use your favorite
    HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use PeerTube. The spec API is fully compatible with
    [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/wiki/API-client-generator-HOWTO)
    which generates a client SDK in the language of your choice - we generate some client SDKs automatically:

    - [Python](https://framagit.org/framasoft/peertube/clients/python)
    - [Go](https://framagit.org/framasoft/peertube/clients/go)
    - [Kotlin](https://framagit.org/framasoft/peertube/clients/kotlin)

    See the [REST API quick start](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-getting-started) for a few
    examples of using the PeerTube API.

    # Authentication

    When you sign up for an account on a PeerTube instance, you are given the possibility
    to generate sessions on it, and authenticate there using an access token. Only __one
    access token can currently be used at a time__.

    ## Roles

    Accounts are given permissions based on their role. There are three roles on
    PeerTube: Administrator, Moderator, and User. See the [roles guide](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/admin-managing-users?id=roles) for a detail of their permissions.

    # Errors

    The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure
    of the API call.

    ```
    HTTP 1.1 404 Not Found
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "errorCode": 1
      "error": "Account not found"
    }
    ```

    We provide error codes for [a growing number of cases](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/blob/develop/shared/models/server/server-error-code.enum.ts),
    but it is still optional.

    ### Validation errors

    Each parameter is evaluated on its own against a set of rules before the route validator
    proceeds with potential testing involving parameter combinations. Errors coming from Validation
    errors appear earlier and benefit from a more detailed error type:

    ```
    HTTP 1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "errors": {
        "id": {
          "value": "a117eb-c6a9-4756-bb09-2a956239f",
          "msg": "Should have a valid id",
          "param": "id",
          "location": "params"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Where `id` is the name of the field concerned by the error, within the route definition.
    `errors.<field>.location` can be either 'params', 'body', 'header', 'query' or 'cookies', and
    `errors.<field>.value` reports the value that didn't pass validation whose `errors.<field>.msg`
    is about.

    # Rate limits

    We are rate-limiting all endpoints of PeerTube's API. Custom values can be set by administrators:

    | Endpoint (prefix: `/api/v1`) | Calls         | Time frame   |
    |------------------------------|---------------|--------------|
    | `/*`                         | 50            | 10 seconds   |
    | `POST /users/token`          | 15            | 5 minutes    |
    | `POST /users/register`       | 2<sup>*</sup> | 5 minutes    |
    | `POST /users/ask-send-verify-email` | 3      | 5 minutes    |

    Depending on the endpoint, <sup>*</sup>failed requests are not taken into account. A service
    limit is announced by a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.

    You can get details about the current state of your rate limit by reading the
    following headers:

    | Header                  | Description                                                |
    |-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | Number of max requests allowed in the current time period  |
    | `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Number of remaining requests in the current time period    |
    | `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | Timestamp of end of current time period as UNIX timestamp  |
    | `Retry-After`           | Seconds to delay after the first `429` is received         |

    # CORS

    This API features [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/),
    allowing cross-domain communication from the browser for some routes:

    | Endpoint                    |
    |------------------------- ---|
    | `/api/*`                    |
    | `/download/*`               |
    | `/lazy-static/*`            |
    | `/live/segments-sha256/*`   |
    | `/.well-known/webfinger`    |

    In addition, all routes serving ActivityPub are CORS-enabled for all origins.

      Managing servers which the instance interacts with is crucial to the concept of federation in PeerTube and external video indexation. The PeerTube server then deals with inter-server ActivityPub operations and propagates information across its social graph by posting activities to actors' inbox endpoints.

      Redundancy is part of the inter-server solidarity that PeerTube fosters. Manage the list of instances you wish to help by seeding their videos according to the policy of video selection of your choice. Note that you have a similar functionality to mirror individual videos, see [video mirroring](#tag/Video-Mirroring).

      Operations dealing with adding video or audio. PeerTube supports two upload modes, and three import modes.

      ### Upload

      - [_legacy_](#operation/uploadLegacy), where the video file is sent in a single request
      - [_resumable_](#operation/uploadResumableInit), where the video file is sent in chunks

      You can upload videos more reliably by using the resumable variant. Its protocol lets
      you resume an upload operation after a network interruption or other transmission failure,
      saving time and bandwidth in the event of network failures.

      Favor using resumable uploads in any of the following cases:
      - You are transferring large files
      - The likelihood of a network interruption is high
      - Uploads are originating from a device with a low-bandwidth or unstable Internet connection,
        such as a mobile device

      ### Import

      - _URL_-based: where the URL points to any service supported by [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/)
      - _magnet_-based: where the URI resolves to a BitTorrent ressource containing a single supported video file
      - _torrent_-based: where the metainfo file resolves to a BitTorrent ressource containing a single supported video file

      The import function is practical when the desired video/audio is available online. It makes PeerTube
      download it for you, saving you as much bandwidth and avoiding any instability or limitation your network might have.

      The search helps to find _videos_ or _channels_ from within the instance and beyond.
      Videos from other instances federated by the instance (that is, instances
      followed by the instance) can be found via keywords and other criteria of
      the advanced search.

      Administrators can also enable the use of a remote search system, indexing
      videos and channels not could be not federated by the instance.

            Specifies the bytes in the file that the request is uploading.

            For example, a value of `bytes 0-262143/1000000` shows that the request is sending the first
            262144 bytes (256 x 1024) in a 2,469,036 byte file.

            Size of the chunk that the request is sending.

            The chunk size __must be a multiple of 256 KB__, and unlike [Google Resumable](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/using_resumable_upload_protocol)
            doesn't mandate for chunks to have the same size throughout the upload sequence.

            Remember that larger chunks are more efficient. PeerTube's web client uses chunks varying from
            1048576 bytes (~1MB) and increases or reduces size depending on connection health.

          * If the current user has the ability to make a remote URI search (this information is available in the config endpoint),
          then reuse the search API to make a search using the object URI so PeerTube instance fetches the remote object and fill its database.
          After that, you can use the classic REST API endpoints to fetch the complete object or interact with it
          * If the current user doesn't have the ability to make a remote URI search, then redirect the user on the origin instance or fetch
          the data from the origin instance API

        Authenticating via OAuth requires the following steps:
        - Have an activated account
        - [Generate] an access token for that account at `/api/v1/users/token`.
        - Make requests with the *Authorization: Bearer <token\>* header
        - Profit, depending on the role assigned to the account

        Note that the __access token is valid for 1 day__ and is given
        along with a __refresh token valid for 2 weeks__.
