    # Introduction
    Welcome to the reference for the Zuora REST API!

    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST_API" target="_blank">REST</a> is a web-service protocol that lends itself to rapid development by using everyday HTTP and JSON technology.

    The Zuora REST API provides a broad set of operations and resources that:

      * Enable Web Storefront integration from your website.
      * Support self-service subscriber sign-ups and account management.
      * Process revenue schedules through custom revenue rule models.
      * Enable manipulation of most objects in the Zuora Object Model.

      ## Endpoints
      
      The Zuora REST API is provided via the following endpoints.
      | Tenant              | Base URL for REST Endpoints |
      |-------------------------|-------------------------|
      |US Production | https://rest.zuora.com   |
      |US API Sandbox    | https://rest.apisandbox.zuora.com|
      |US Performance Test | https://rest.pt1.zuora.com |
      |EU Production | https://rest.eu.zuora.com |
      |EU Sandbox | https://rest.sandbox.eu.zuora.com |
      
      The production endpoint provides access to your live user data. The API Sandbox tenant is a good place to test your code without affecting real-world data. To use it, you must be provisioned with an API Sandbox tenant - your Zuora representative can help you if needed.
      
      ## Access to the API
      
      If you have a Zuora tenant, you already have access to the API.
      
      If you don't have a Zuora tenant, go to <a href="
    https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive" target="_blank">https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive</a> and sign up for a Production Test Drive tenant. The tenant comes with seed data, such as a sample product catalog.

    **Note:** Currently, you need to contact <a href="http://support.zuora.com/" target="_blank">Zuora Global Support</a> to enable REST API in Services environments.

    We recommend that you <a href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users/Create_an_API_User" target="_blank">create an API user</a> specifically for making API calls. Don't log in to the Zuora UI with this account. Logging in to the UI enables a security feature that periodically expires the account's password, which may eventually cause authentication failures with the API. Note that a user role does not have write access to Zuora REST services unless it has the API Write Access permission as described in those instructions.

    # Authentication

    ## OAuth v2.0

    Zuora recommends that you use OAuth v2.0 to authenticate to the Zuora REST API. Currently, OAuth is not available in every environment. See [Zuora Testing Environments](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/D_Zuora_Environments) for more information.

    Zuora recommends you to create a dedicated API user with API write access on a tenant when authenticating via OAuth, and then create an OAuth client for this user. By doing this, you can control permissions of the API user without affecting other non-API users. Note that if a user is deactivated, all his OAuth clients will be automatically deactivated.

    Authenticating via OAuth requires the following steps:
    1. Create a Client
    2. Generate a Token
    3. Make Authenticated Requests

    ### Create a Client

    You must first [create an OAuth client](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users#Create_an_OAuth_Client_for_a_User) in the Zuora UI. To do this, you must be an administrator of your Zuora tenant. This is a one-time operation. You will be provided with a Client ID and a Client Secret. Please note this information down, as it will be required for the next step.

    **Note:** The OAuth client will be owned by a Zuora user account. If you want to perform PUT, POST, or DELETE operations using the OAuth client, the owner of the OAuth client must have a Platform role that includes the "API Write Access" permission.

    ### Generate a Token

    After creating a client, you must make a call to obtain a bearer token using the [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) operation. This operation requires the following parameters:
    - `client_id` - the Client ID displayed when you created the OAuth client in the previous step
    - `client_secret` - the Client Secret displayed when you created the OAuth client in the previous step
    - `grant_type` - must be set to `client_credentials`

    **Note**: The Client ID and Client Secret mentioned above were displayed when you created the OAuth Client in the prior step. The [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) response specifies how long the bearer token is valid for. Call [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) again to generate a new bearer token.

    ### Make Authenticated Requests

    To authenticate subsequent API requests, you must provide a valid bearer token in an HTTP header:

    `Authorization: Bearer {bearer_token}`

    If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Entities) enabled, you need to set an additional header to specify the ID of the entity that you want to access. You can use the `scope` field in the [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) response to determine whether you need to specify an entity ID.

    If the `scope` field contains more than one entity ID, you must specify the ID of the entity that you want to access. For example, if the `scope` field contains `entity.1a2b7a37-3e7d-4cb3-b0e2-883de9e766cc` and `entity.c92ed977-510c-4c48-9b51-8d5e848671e9`, specify one of the following headers:
    - `Zuora-Entity-Ids: 1a2b7a37-3e7d-4cb3-b0e2-883de9e766cc`
    - `Zuora-Entity-Ids: c92ed977-510c-4c48-9b51-8d5e848671e9`

    **Note**: For a limited period of time, Zuora will accept the `entityId` header as an alternative to the `Zuora-Entity-Ids` header. If you choose to set the `entityId` header, you must remove all "-" characters from the entity ID in the `scope` field.

    If the `scope` field contains a single entity ID, you do not need to specify an entity ID.


    ## Other Supported Authentication Schemes

    Zuora continues to support the following additional legacy means of authentication:

      * Use username and password. Include authentication with each request in the header: 
      
        * `apiAccessKeyId` 
        * `apiSecretAccessKey`

      * Use an authorization cookie. The cookie authorizes the user to make calls to the REST API for the duration specified in  **Administration > Security Policies > Session timeout**. The cookie expiration time is reset with this duration after every call to the REST API. To obtain a cookie, call the [Connections](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Connections) resource with the following API user information: 
      
        *   ID    
        *   password
        
      * For CORS-enabled APIs only: Include a 'single-use' token in the request header, which re-authenticates the user with each request. See below for more details.

    ### Entity Id and Entity Name

    The `entityId` and `entityName` parameters are only used for [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity "Zuora Multi-entity"). These are the legacy parameters that Zuora will only continue to support for a period of time. Zuora recommends you to use the `Zuora-Entity-Ids` parameter instead.


    The  `entityId` and `entityName` parameters specify the Id and the [name of the entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/B_Introduction_to_Entity_and_Entity_Hierarchy#Name_and_Display_Name "Introduction to Entity and Entity Hierarchy") that you want to access, respectively. Note that you must have permission to access the entity. 

    You can specify either the `entityId` or `entityName` parameter in the authentication to access and view an entity.

      * If both `entityId` and `entityName` are specified in the authentication, an error occurs. 
      * If neither `entityId` nor `entityName` is specified in the authentication, you will log in to the entity in which your user account is created. 
      

    To get the entity Id and entity name, you can use the GET Entities REST call. For more information, see [API User Authentication](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/A_Overview_of_Multi-entity#API_User_Authentication "API User Authentication").
      
      ### Token Authentication for CORS-Enabled APIs
      
      The CORS mechanism enables REST API calls to Zuora to be made directly from your customer's browser, with all credit card and security information transmitted directly to Zuora. This minimizes your PCI compliance burden, allows you to implement advanced validation on your payment forms, and  makes your payment forms look just like any other part of your website.
      
    For security reasons, instead of using cookies, an API request via CORS uses **tokens** for authentication.

    The token method of authentication is only designed for use with requests that must originate from your customer's browser; **it should  not be considered a replacement to the existing cookie authentication** mechanism.

    See [Zuora CORS REST](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/REST_API/A_REST_basics/G_CORS_REST "Zuora CORS REST") for details on how CORS works and how you can begin to implement customer calls to the Zuora REST APIs. See  [HMAC Signatures](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POSTHMACSignature "HMAC Signatures") for details on the HMAC method that returns the authentication token.

    # Requests and Responses

    ## Request IDs 
    As a general rule, when asked to supply a "key" for an account or subscription (accountKey, account-key, subscriptionKey, subscription-key), you can provide either the actual ID or  the number of the entity.

    ## HTTP Request Body

    Most of the parameters and data accompanying your requests will be contained in the body of the HTTP request. 

    The Zuora REST API accepts JSON in the HTTP request body. No other data format (e.g., XML) is supported.

    ### Data Type

    ([Actions](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Actions) and CRUD operations only) We recommend that you do not specify the decimal values with quotation marks, commas, and spaces. Use characters of `+-0-9.eE`, for example, `5`, `1.9`, `-8.469`, and `7.7e2`. Also, Zuora does not convert currencies for decimal values.

    ## Testing a Request

    Use a third party client, such as [curl](https://curl.haxx.se "curl"), [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com "Postman"), or [Advanced REST Client](https://advancedrestclient.com "Advanced REST Client"), to test the Zuora REST API.

    You can test the Zuora REST API from the Zuora API Sandbox or Production tenants. If connecting to Production, bear in mind that you are working with your live production data, not sample data or test data.

    ## Testing with Credit Cards

    Sooner or later it will probably be necessary to test some transactions that involve credit cards. For suggestions on how to handle this, see [Going Live With Your Payment Gateway](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/M_Payment_Gateways/C_Managing_Payment_Gateways/B_Going_Live_Payment_Gateways#Testing_with_Credit_Cards "C_Zuora_User_Guides/A_Billing_and_Payments/M_Payment_Gateways/C_Managing_Payment_Gateways/B_Going_Live_Payment_Gateways#Testing_with_Credit_Cards"
    ).

    ## Concurrent Request Limits

    Zuora enforces tenant-level concurrent request limits. See <a href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Policies/Concurrent_Request_Limits" target="_blank">Concurrent Request Limits</a> for more information.



    ## Error Handling

    Responses and error codes are detailed in [Responses and errors](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/REST_API/A_REST_basics/3_Responses_and_errors "Responses and errors").

    # Pagination

    When retrieving information (using GET methods), the optional `pageSize` query parameter sets the maximum number of rows to return in a response. The maximum is `40`; larger values are treated as `40`. If this value is empty or invalid, `pageSize` typically defaults to `10`.

    The default value for the maximum number of rows retrieved can be overridden at the method level.

    If more rows are available, the response will include a `nextPage` element, which contains a URL for requesting the next page.  If this value is not provided, no more rows are available. No "previous page" element is explicitly provided; to support backward paging, use the previous call.

    ## Array Size

    For data items that are not paginated, the REST API supports arrays of up to 300 rows.  Thus, for instance, repeated pagination can retrieve thousands of customer accounts, but within any account an array of no more than 300 rate plans is returned.

    # API Versions

    The Zuora REST API are version controlled. Versioning ensures that Zuora REST API changes are backward compatible. Zuora uses a major and minor version nomenclature to manage changes. By specifying a version in a REST request, you can get expected responses regardless of future changes to the API.

    ## Major Version

    The major version number of the REST API appears in the REST URL. Currently, Zuora only supports the **v1** major version. For example, `POST https://rest.zuora.com/v1/subscriptions`.

    ## Minor Version

    Zuora uses minor versions for the REST API to control small changes. For example, a field in a REST method is deprecated and a new field is used to replace it. 

    Some fields in the REST methods are supported as of minor versions. If a field is not noted with a minor version, this field is available for all minor versions. If a field is noted with a minor version, this field is in version control. You must specify the supported minor version in the request header to process without an error. 

    If a field is in version control, it is either with a minimum minor version or a maximum minor version, or both of them. You can only use this field with the minor version between the minimum and the maximum minor versions. For example, the `invoiceCollect` field in the POST Subscription method is in version control and its maximum minor version is 189.0. You can only use this field with the minor version 189.0 or earlier.

    If you specify a version number in the request header that is not supported, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API. In our REST API documentation, if a field or feature requires a minor version number, we note that in the field description.

    You only need to specify the version number when you use the fields require a minor version. To specify the minor version, set the `zuora-version` parameter to the minor version number in the request header for the request call. For example, the `collect` field is in 196.0 minor version. If you want to use this field for the POST Subscription method, set the  `zuora-version` parameter to `196.0` in the request header. The `zuora-version` parameter is case sensitive.

    For all the REST API fields, by default, if the minor version is not specified in the request header, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API to avoid breaking your integration. 

    ### Minor Version History

    The supported minor versions are not serial. This section documents the changes made to each Zuora REST API minor version.

    The following table lists the supported versions and the fields that have a Zuora REST API minor version.

    | Fields         | Minor Version      | REST Methods    | Description |

      Actions are operations that are batch in nature. For example, the "create", "update", "delete", and other operations allow changes to up-to 50 objects at a time. The "query" operation will return up-to 2000 result records back at a time, before requiring additional pages of data to be returned via a subsequent "queryMore" operation.

      The default WSDL version for Actions is 79. If you want to change the WSDL version, set the `X-Zuora-WSDL-Version` field in the request header for the request call.

      **Note**: Actions do not support the Advanced AR Settlement feature. This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement.

        The `baseObject` field specifies which object to define a trigger on. The `condition` field is a [JEXL](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/) expression that specifies when to trigger events. The expression can contain fields from the object that the trigger is defined on.

        **Note:** The condition cannot contain fields from [data source](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/M_Export_ZOQL) objects that are joined to the object that the trigger is defined on.

        For example, the following condition causes an event to be triggered whenever an invoice is posted with an amount greater than 1000:

        ```changeType == 'UPDATE' && Invoice.Status == 'Posted' && Invoice.Status_old != 'Posted' && Invoice.Amount > 1000```

        Where:

          * `changeType` is a keyword that specifies the type of change that occurred to the Invoice object. For all objects, the supported values of `changeType` are `INSERT`, `UPDATE`,  and `DELETE`.
          * `Invoice.Status` is the value of the Invoice object's `Status` field after the change occurred.
          * `Invoice.Status_old` is the value of the Invoice object's `Status` field before the change occurred.

        In the above example, the value of `baseObject` would be `Invoice`.

        **Note:** You can define up to 200 event triggers in your tenant.

        Creates an accounting period.
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        * You must have Zuora Finance enabled on your tenant.
        * You must have the Create Accounting Period user permission.

        Limitations
        -----------
        * When creating the first accounting period on your tenant, the start date must be equal to or earlier than the date of the earliest transaction on the tenant.
        * Start and end dates of accounting periods must be contiguous. For example, if one accounting period ends on January 31, the next period must start on February 1.
        * If you have the Revenue Recognition Package and have enabled the "Monthly recognition over time" revenue recognition model, the accounting period start date and end date must be on the first day and last day of the month, respectively. Note that the start and end dates do not necessarily have to be in the same month.

        Updates an accounting period.

        Prerequisites
        -------------

        * You must have Zuora Finance enabled on your tenant.

        * You must have the Create Accounting Period user permission. See [Finance Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/f_Finance_Roles).

        Limitations
        -----------

        * You can update the start date of only the earliest accounting period on your tenant. You cannot update the start date of later periods.

        * If you update the earliest accounting period, the start date must be equal to or earlier than the date of the earliest transaction on the tenant.

        * Start and end dates of accounting periods must be contiguous. For example, if one accounting period ends on January 31, the next period must start on February 1.

        * If you have the Revenue Recognition Package and have enabled the "Monthly recognition over time" revenue recognition model, the accounting period start date and end date must be on the first day and last day of the month, respectively. Note that the start and end dates do not necessarily have to be in the same month.

        * You cannot update the start date or end date of an accounting period if:
          * Any revenue has been distributed into the period.
          * The period has any active journal entries.

        Prerequisites
        -------------
        You must have Zuora Finance enabled on your tenant. You must have the Manage Close Process and Run Trial Balance user permissions.

        Limitations

        * The accounting period cannot be in the process of running a trial balance.
        * All earlier accounting periods must be closed.
        * There must be no required action items for the accounting period. See Reconcile Transactions Before Closing an Accounting Period for more information.

        Notes
        -----
        When you close an accounting period in Zuora, a trial balance is automatically run for that period. A successful response means only that the accounting period is now closed, but does not mean that the trial balance has successfully completed.

        Notes
        -----
        When you set an accounting period to pending close in Zuora, a trial balance is automatically run for that period. A response of `{ "success": true }`  means only that the accounting period status is now pending close, but does not mean that the trial balance has successfully completed. You can use the Get Accounting Period REST API call to view details about the outcome of the trial balance.

        Prerequisites
        -------------

        * You must have Zuora Finance enabled on your tenant.

        * You must have the Manage Close Process and Run Trial Balance user permissions. See [Finance Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/f_Finance_Roles).

                  
        Limitations 
        -----------
         
         * The accounting period must be open.
         
         * The accounting period cannot already be in the process of running a trial balance.
         
        Notes
        -----
        The trial balance is run asynchronously. A response of `{ "success": true }` means only that the trial balance has started processing, but does not mean that the trial balance has successfully completed. You can use the [Get Accounting Period](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/REST_API/B_REST_API_reference/Accounting_Periods/Get_Accounting_Period) REST API call to view details about the outcome of the trial balance.

      description: |
        This REST API reference describes how to create a customer account with a credit-card payment method, a bill-to contact, and an optional sold-to contact. Request and response field descriptions and sample code are provided. Use this method to optionally create a subscription, invoice for that subscription, and collect payment through the default payment method. The transaction is atomic; if any part fails for any reason, the entire transaction is rolled back.

        This API call is CORS Enabled, so you can use client-side Javascript to invoke the call. 

        ## Notes
        1. The account is created in active status.  
        2. The request must provide either a **creditCard** structure or the **hpmCreditCardPaymentMethodId** field (but not both). The one provided becomes the default payment method for this account. If the credit card information is declined or can't be verified, then the account is not created.
        3. Customer accounts created with this call are automatically be set to Auto Pay.
        4. If either the **workEmail** or **personalEmail** are specified, then the account's email delivery preference is automatically set to `true`. (In that case, emails go to the **workEmail** address, if it exists, or else the **personalEmail**.) If neither field is specified, the email delivery preference is automatically set to `false`.
        5. You cannot use this operation to create subscriptions if you have the Orders feature enabled. See [Orders Migration Guidance](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AB_Orders_Migration_Guidance) for more information.

        ## Defaults for customerAcceptanceDate and serviceActivationDate
        Default values for **customerAcceptanceDate** and **serviceActivationDate** are set as follows.

        |        | serviceActivationDate(SA) specified          | serviceActivationDate (SA) NOT specified  |
        | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
        | customerAcceptanceDate (CA) specified      | SA uses value in the request call; CA uses value in the request call| CA uses value in the request call;SA uses CE as default |
        | customerAcceptanceDate (CA) NOT specified      | SA uses value in the request call; CA uses SA as default |   SA and CA use CE as default |

        This REST API reference describes how to update a customer account by specifying the account-key.

        ## Notes
        1. Only the fields to be changed should be specified.  Any field that's not included in the request body will not be changed.
        2. If an empty field is submitted with this call, the corresponding field in the account is emptied.
        3. Email addresses: If no email addresses are specified, no change is made to the email addresses on file or to the email delivery preference. If either the **personalEmail** or **workEmail** is specified (or both), the system updates the corresponding email address(es) on file and the email delivery preference is set to `true`. (In that case, emails go to the **workEmail** address, if it exists, or else the **personalEmail**.) On the other hand, if as a result of this call both of the email addresses for the account are empty, the email delivery preference is set to `false`.
        4. The bill-to and sold-to contacts are separate data entities; updating either one does not update the other.

        Use the amend call to change a subscription, such as upgrading the subscription.

        ## Notes
        * This feature is unavailable if you have the Orders feature enabled. See [Orders Migration Guidance](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AB_Orders_Migration_Guidance) for more information.
        * If you do not have the Orders feature enabled, Zuora recommends that you use [Update subscription](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/PUT_Subscription) to amend subscriptions.

        The amend call:

        * Supports the Amendment object
        * Is not an asynchronous process

        ## Limits 
        ### Objects per Call 
        Up to ten Amendment objects.



        ### Errors 
        If one of your Amendment objects fails in a single amend call, then the entire call fails.

        ## Required Fields 
        The following fields are always required for this call:

        * `Amendment`.`Type`
        * `Amendment`.`Name`
        * `Amendment`.`SubscriptionId`

        Use the create call to create one or more objects of a specific type. You can specify different types in different create calls, but each create call must apply to only one type of object.

        ## Limits

        ### Objects per Call

        50 objects are supported in a single call.



        ## How to Use this Call

        You can call create on an array of one or more zObjects. It returns an array of SaveResults, indicating the success or failure of creating each object. The following information applies to this call:

        * You cannot pass in null zObjects.
        * You can pass in a maximum of 50 zObjects at a time.
        * All objects must be of the same type.

        ### Using Create and Subscribe Calls 
        Both the create and subscribe calls will create a new account. However, there are differences between the calls.

        Use the create call to create an account independent of a subscription.

        Use the subscribe call to create the account with the subscription and the initial payment information.

        Use the execute call to execute a process to split an invoice into multiple invoices. The original invoice must be in draft status. The resulting invoices are called split invoices.

        **Note:** This feature is in **Limited Availability**. If you wish to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com). 

        To split a draft invoice into multiple split invoices:

        1. Use the create call to create a separate InvoiceSplitItem object for each split invoice that you want to create from the original draft invoice.
        2. Use the create call to create a single InvoiceSplit object to collect all of the InvoiceSplitItem objects.
        3. Use the execute call to split the draft invoice into multiple split invoices.

        You need to create InvoiceSplitItem objects and an InvoiceSplit object before you can use the execute call. 

        * Supported objects: InvoiceSplit
        * Asynchronous process: yes

        Generates an on-demand invoice for a specific customer. This is similar to creating an ad-hoc bill run for a specific customer account in the Zuora UI.

        * Supported objects: Invoice
        * Asynchronous process: yes

        The ID of the generated invoice is returned in the response. If multiple invoices are generated, only the id of the first invoice generated is returned. This occurs when an account has multiple subscriptions with the [invoice subscription separately](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Subscriptions/B_Creating_Subscriptions/Invoicing_Subscriptions_Separately) option enabled.

      description: |
        The query call sends a query expression by specifying the object to query, the fields to retrieve from that object, and any filters to determine whether a given object should be queried.


        You can use [Zuora Object Query Language](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/K_Zuora_Object_Query_Language) (ZOQL) to construct those queries, passing them through the `queryString`.


        Once the call is made, the API executes the query against the specified object and returns a query response object to your application. Your application can then iterate through rows in the query response to retrieve information.

        ## Limitations 

        This call has the following limitations:

        * All ZOQL keywords must be in lower case.
        * The number of records returned is limited to 2000 records

        Use queryMore to request additional results from a previous query call. If your initial query call returns more than 2000 results, you can use queryMore to query for the additional results.


        Any `queryLocator` results greater than 2,000, will only be stored by Zuora for 5 days before it is deleted.


         This call sends a request for additional results from an initial query call. If the initial query call returns more than 2000 results, you can use the `queryLocator` returned from query to request the next set of results.


        **Note:** Zuora expires queryMore cursors after 15 minutes of activity.


        To use queryMore, you first construct a query call. By default, the query call will return up to 2000 results. If there are more than 2000 results, query will return a boolean `done`, which will be marked as `false`, and a `queryLocator`, which is a marker you will pass to queryMore to get the next set of results.

  /v1/action/subscribe:
    post:
      description: |

        This call performs many actions.  Use the subscribe call to bundle information required to create at least one new subscription.

        **Note:** This feature is unavailable if you have the Orders feature enabled. See [Orders Migration Guidance](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AB_Orders_Migration_Guidance) for more information.

        The call takes in an array of SubscribeRequests. Because it takes an array, you can submit a batch of subscription requests at once. You can create up to 50 different subscriptions in a single subscribe call.

        This is a combined call that you can use to perform all of the following tasks in a single call:

        * Create accounts
        * Create contacts
        * Create payment methods, including external payment options
        * Create an invoice for the subscription
        * Apply the first payment to a subscription

        ## Object Limits 
        50 objects are supported in a single call.



        ## Effective Date
        If the effective date is in the future, the invoices will not be generated, and there will be no invoice number.

        ## Subscription Name, Number, and ID 
        ### Subscription Name and Number 
        The subscription name is a unique identifier for the subscription. If you do not specify a value for the name, Zuora will create one automatically. The automatically generated value is known as the subscription number, such as `A-S00000080`. You cannot change the subscription name or number after creating the subscription. 

        * **Subscription name**: The name that you set for the subscription.
        * **Subscription number**: The value generated by Zuora automatically if you do not specify a subscription name. 

        Both the subscription name and number must be unique. If they are not, an error will occur.

        ### Subscription ID 
        The subscription ID is a 32-digit ID in the format 4028xxxx. This is also the unique identifier for a subscription. This value is automatically generated by the system and cannot be edited or updated, but it can be queried. One subscription can have only one subscription name or number, but it can have multiple IDs: Each version of a subscription has a different ID.

        The Subscription object contains the fields `OriginalId` and `PreviousSubscriptionId`. `OriginalId` is the ID for the first version of a subscription. `PreviousSubscriptionId` is the ID of the version created immediately prior to the current version.

        ## Subscription Preview 
        You can preview invoices that would be generated by the subscribe call. 

        ## Invoice Subscriptions Separately
        If you have enabled the invoice subscriptions separately feature, a subscribe call will generate an invoice for each subscription for every subscription where the field `IsInvoiceSeparate` is set to `true`.

        If the invoice subscriptions separately feature is disabled, a subscribe call will generate a single invoice for all subscriptions.

        See [Invoicing Subscriptions Separately](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Subscriptions/B_Creating_Subscriptions/Invoicing_Subscriptions_Separately) for more information.

        ## Subscriptions and Draft Invoices 
        If a draft invoice that includes charges exists in a customer account, using the subscribe call to create a new subscription and generate an invoice will cause the new subscription to be added to the existing draft invoice. Zuora will then post the invoice. 

        ## When to Use Subscribe and Create Calls 
        You can use either the subscribe call or the create call to create the objects associated with a subscription (accounts, contacts, and so on). There are differences between these calls, however, and some situations are better for one or the other.

        ### Use the Subscribe Call 
        The subscribe call bundles up all the information you need for a subscription. Use the subscribe call to create new subscriptions when you have all the information you need.

        Subscribe calls cannot update BillTo, SoldTo, and Account objects. Payment information objects cannot be updated if there is an existing account ID in the call. These objects are not supported in a subscribe call.

        ### Use the Create Call 
        The create call is more useful when you want to develop in stages. For example, if you want to first create an account, then a contact, and so on. If you do not have all information available, use the create call. To create a subscription, you must activate the account from Draft status to Active by calling the subscribe call.

        Updates the information in one or more objects of the same type. You can specify different types of objects in different update calls, but each specific update call must apply to only one type of object.

        You can update an array of one or more zObjects. It returns an array of SaveResults, indicating the success or failure of updating each object. The following information applies to this call:

        * You cannot pass in null zObjects.
        * You can pass in a maximum of 50 zObjects at a time.
        * All objects must be of the same type.
        * For each field in each object, you must determine that object's ID. Then populate the fields that you want update with the new information.
        * Zuora ignores unrecognized fields in update calls. For example, if an optional field is spelled incorrectly or a field that does not exist is specified, Zuora ignores the field and continues to process the call. No error message is returned for unrecognized fields.

        ## Object Limits 
        50 objects are supported in a single call.

    post:

        Manually emails all the billing documents that are generated from a specified bill run to your customers. 


        Bill runs can generate invoices and credit memos based on your [invoice and credit memo generation rule](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Advanced_AR_Settlement/Credit_and_Debit_Memos/Rules_for_Generating_Invoices_and_Credit_Memos). Credit memos are only available if you have the Advanced AR Settlement feature enabled.


        Using this API operation, the billing documents are sent to the email addresses specified in the **To Email** field of the email templates. The email template used for each billing document is set in the **Delivery Options** panel of the **Edit notification** dialog from the Zuora UI. See [Edit Email Templates](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/Notifications/Create_Email_Templates) for more information about how to edit the **To Email** field in the email template.





        ## Notes
          - Even though no field is required in the Request body, you still need to specify `{}` in the request. Otherwise, an error will be returned.


          - You can only email posted billing documents.
          
          
          - You must activate the following notifications before emailing invoices and credit memos:
            - **Manual Email For Invoice | Manual Email For Invoice** 
            - **Email Credit Memo | Manually email Credit Memo**
         
          
          - To include the invoice PDF in the email, select the **Include Invoice PDF** check box in the **Edit notification** dialog from the Zuora UI. To include the credit memo PDF in the email, select the **Include Credit Memo PDF** check box in the **Edit notification** dialog from the Zuora UI. See [Create and Edit Notifications](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/Notifications/C_Create_Notifications#section_2) for more information.



          - Zuora sends the email messages based on the email template you set. You can set the email template to use in the **Delivery Options** panel of the **Edit notification** dialog from the Zuora UI. By default, the following templates are used for billing documents:
            - Invoices: **Invoice Posted Default Email Template**
            - Credit memos: **Manual Email for Credit Memo Default Template**  

            See [Create and Edit Email Templates](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/Notifications/Create_Email_Templates) for more information.

            *operator* *field_name*

            You can use at most two sortable fields in one URL path. Use a comma to separate sortable fields. For example:  *operator* *field_name*, *operator* *field_name*  

            *operator* is used to mark the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field.  

              - The `-` operator indicates an ascending order.
              - The `+` operator indicates a descending order.

            *field_name* indicates the name of a sortable field. The supported sortable fields of this operation are as below:

              - documentDate
              - documentType
              
            Examples:
            - /billing-documents?accountId=4028905f5e4feb38015e50af9aa002d1&sort=+documentDate,-documentType
            - /billing-documents?accountId=4028905f5e4feb38015e50af9aa002d1&status=Posted&sort=+documentDate&page=2&pageSize=15

        Creates billing preview runs for multiple customer accounts.

        You can run up to 10 billing previews in batches concurrently. A single batch of customer accounts can only have one billing preview run at a time. So you can have up to 10 batches running at the same time. If you create a billing preview run for all customer batches, you cannot create another billing preview run until this preview run is completed.

        This reference describes how to perform a mass action through the REST API. 

        Using this API method, you send a multipart/form-data request containing a `.csv` file with data about the mass action you want to perform. Zuora returns a key and then asynchronously processes the mass action. You can use the key to get details about the result of the mass action.
      operationId: POST_MassUpdater
      parameters:
        - $ref: '#/parameters/GLOBAL_HEADER_Zuora_Entity_Ids_Single'
        - description: |
            File containing data about the mass action you want to perform. The file requirements are the same as when uploading a file through the Mass Updater in the Zuora UI. The file must be a .csv file or a zipped .csv file.

            The maximum file size is 4 MB.

            The data in the file must be formatted according to the mass action type you want to perform.

        This reference describes how to stop a mass action through the REST API. You can stop a mass action when its status is Pending or Processing. After you have stopped a mass action, you can get the mass action result to see details of the mass action.

        - If you stop a mass action when its status is Pending, no response file is generated because no records have been processed.

        - If you stop a mass action when its status is Processing, a response file is generated. You can check the response file to see which records have been processed and which have not. In the response file, the **Success** column has the value `Y` (successful) or `N` (failed) for processed records, and a blank value for unprocessed records.

        Records that have already been processed when a mass action is stopped are not rolled back.

        Shares a product with a target entity. Zuora synchronizes the shared products to the target entity after sharing. For more information about product sharing, see [Products Sharing Across Entities](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/C_Business_Objects_Sharing_Across_Entities/B_Products_Sharing_Across_Entities).

        Note that:

        - You must finish all the [prerequisites](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/C_Business_Objects_Sharing_Across_Entities/B_Products_Sharing_Across_Entities/Share_Products) before sharing products with other entities. 

        - Only source entity administrators have permission to share products with other entities. You must make the call as a source entity administrator.

        - Currently, you can only share a product with one entity at a time. An error occurs if you try to share a product to more than one entity.

        Establishes a connection to the Zuora REST API service based on a valid user credentials. 

        **Note:**This is a legacy REST API. Zuora recommends you to use [OAuth](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#section/Authentication/OAuth-v2.0) for authentication instead. 

        This call authenticates the user and returns an API session cookie that's used to authorize subsequent calls to the REST API. The credentials must belong to a user account that has permission to access the API service.

        As noted elsewhere, it's strongly recommended that an account used for Zuora API activity is never used to log into the Zuora UI.  Once an account is used to log into the UI, it may be subject to periodic forced password changes, which may eventually lead to authentication failures when using the API.

            This parameter restricts the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to filter on.

             A single filter uses the following form: 

            *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value*
                        
            Filters can be combined by using `&`. For example: *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value* `&` *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value*

            *fieldsFilterable* indicates the name of a supported field that you can use to filter the response data. The supported filterable fields of this operation are as below:

              - number
              - accountId 
              - currency
              - creditMemoDate
              - targetDate
              - status
              - amount
              - taxAmount
              - totalTaxExemptAmount
              - unappliedAmount
              - refundAmount
              - appliedAmount
              - referredInvoiceId
              - transferredToAccounting
              - createdDate
              - createdById
              - updatedDate
              - updatedById
              - autoApplyUponPosting
              - excludeFromAutoApplyRules

             *field_value* indicates a valid value of the filterable field. If the type of the field value is string, you can set the field to `null` value for filtering. Then, you can get the response data with this field value being 'null'. For more information about these fields, see the field descriptions in the **Responses** section. 
              
            Examples:

            - /creditmemos?status=Processed

            - /creditmemos?referredInvoiceId=null&status=Draft

            This parameter restricts the order of the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to sort on.

            A sortable field uses the following form: 

            *operator* *field_name*

            You can use at most two sortable fields in one URL path. Use a comma to separate sortable fields. For example:  *operator* *field_name*, *operator* *field_name*  

            *operator* is used to mark the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field.

              - The `-` operator indicates an ascending order.
              - The `+` operator indicates a descending order.

            By default, the response data is displayed in descending order by credit memo number.

            *field_name* indicates the name of a sortable field. The supported sortable fields of this operation are as below:

              - number
              - accountId 
              - creditMemoDate
              - targetDate
              - status
              - amount
              - taxAmount
              - totalTaxExemptAmount
              - unappliedAmount
              - refundAmount
              - appliedAmount
              - referredInvoiceId
              - transferredToAccounting
              - createdDate
              - createdById
              - updatedDate

        **Note:** The Advanced AR Settlement feature is in **Limited Availability**. This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you wish to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com/). 

        Creates an ad-hoc credit memo from a product rate plan charge. Zuora only supports one-time negative charges for credit memos. 

        You can create a credit memo only if you have the user permission. See [Billing Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/d_Billing_Roles) for more information.

        Updates the basic and finance information about a credit memo. Currently, Zuora supports updating tax-exclusive memo items, but does not support updating tax-inclusive memo items. 

        If the amount of a memo item is updated, the tax will be recalculated in the following conditions:
          - The memo is created from a product rate plan charge and you use Avalara to calculate the tax.
          - The memo is created from an invoice and you use Avalara or Zuora Tax to calculate the tax.

        You can update a credit memo only if you have the user permission. See [Billing Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/d_Billing_Roles) for more information.

        Sends a posted credit memo to the specified email addresses manually.



        ## Notes
          - You must activate the **Email Credit Memo | Manually email Credit Memo** notification before emailing credit memos. To include the credit memo PDF in the email, select the **Include Credit Memo PDF** check box in the **Edit notification** dialog from the Zuora UI. See [Create and Edit Notifications](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/Notifications/C_Create_Notifications#section_2) for more information.


          - Zuora sends the email messages based on the email template you set. You can set the email template to use in the **Delivery Options** panel of the **Edit notification** dialog from the Zuora UI. By default, the **Manual Email for Credit Memo Default Template** template is used. See [Create and Edit Email Templates](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/Notifications/Create_Email_Templates) for more information.


          - The credit memos are sent only to the work email addresses or personal email addresses of the Bill To contact if the following conditions are all met:

            * The `useEmailTemplateSetting` field is set to `false`.
            * The email addresses are not specified in the `emailAddresses` field.

            This parameter restricts the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to filter on.

             A single filter uses the following form: 

            *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value*
                        
            Filters can be combined by using `&`. For example: *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value* `&` *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value*

            *fieldsFilterable* indicates the name of a supported field that you can use to filter the response data. The supported filterable fields of this operation are as below:

              - id
              - amount
              - appliedAmount
              - refundAmount
              - sku
              - skuName
              - serviceStartDate
              - serviceEndDate
              - sourceItemId
              - createdDate
              - createdById
              - updatedDate
              - updatedById
              - subscriptionId

             *field_value* indicates a valid value of the filterable field. If the type of the field value is string, you can set the field to `null` value for filtering. Then, you can get the response data with this field value being 'null'. For more information about these fields, see the field descriptions in the **Responses** section. 
              
            Examples:

            - /creditmemos/402890245c7ca371015c7cb40ac30015/items?amount=100

            - /creditmemos/402890245c7ca371015c7cb40ac30015/items?amount=100&sort=createdDate
          in: query

          required: false
          type: string

            This parameter restricts the order of the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to sort on.

            A sortable field uses the following form: 

            *operator* *field_name*

            You can use at most two sortable fields in one URL path. Use a comma to separate sortable fields. For example:  *operator* *field_name*, *operator* *field_name*  

            *operator* is used to mark the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field.

              - The `-` operator indicates an ascending order.
              - The `+` operator indicates a descending order.

            By default, the response data is displayed in descending order by updated date.

            *field_name* indicates the name of a sortable field. The supported sortable fields of this operation are as below:

              - id
              - amount
              - appliedAmount
              - refundAmount
              - sku
              - skuName
              - serviceStartDate
              - serviceEndDate
              - sourceItemId
              - createdDate
              - createdById
              - updatedDate
              - updatedById
              - subscriptionId
              
            Examples:

            This parameter restricts the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to filter on.

             A single filter uses the following form: 

            *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value*
                        
            Filters can be combined by using `&`. For example: *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value* `&` *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value*

            *fieldsFilterable* indicates the name of a supported field that you can use to filter the response data. The supported filterable fields of this operation are as below:

              - number
              - accountId
              - debitMemoDate
              - targetDate
              - dueDate
              - currency
              - status
              - amount
              - taxAmount
              - totalTaxExemptAmount
              - balance
              - beAppliedAmount
              - referredInvoiceId
              - createdDate
              - createdById
              - updatedDate
              - updatedById

             *field_value* indicates a valid value of the filterable field. If the type of the field value is string, you can set the field to `null` value for filtering. Then, you can get the response data with this field value being 'null'. For more information about these fields, see the field descriptions in the **Responses** section. 
              
            Examples:

            - /debitmemos?status=Processed

            - /debitmemos?referredInvoiceId=null&status=Draft

            - /debitmemos?status=Processed&type=External&sort=+number

            This parameter restricts the order of the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to sort on.

            A sortable field uses the following form: 

            *operator* *field_name*

            You can use at most two sortable fields in one URL path. Use a comma to separate sortable fields. For example:  *operator* *field_name*, *operator* *field_name*  

            *operator* is used to mark the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field.

              - The `-` operator indicates an ascending order.
              - The `+` operator indicates a descending order.

            By default, the response data is displayed in descending order by debit memo number.

            *field_name* indicates the name of a sortable field. The supported sortable fields of this operation are as below:

              - number
              - accountId
              - debitMemoDate
              - targetDate
              - dueDate
              - amount
              - taxAmount
              - totalTaxExemptAmount
              - balance
              - beAppliedAmount
              - referredInvoiceId
              - createdDate
              - createdById
              - updatedDate
              - updatedById
              
            Examples:

            - /debitmemos?sort=+number

            - /debitmemos?status=Processed&sort=-number,+amount

        Updates the basic and finance information about a debit memo. Currently, Zuora supports updating tax-exclusive memo items, but does not support updating tax-inclusive memo items. 

        If the amount of a memo item is updated, the tax will be recalculated in the following conditions:
          - The memo is created from a product rate plan charge and you use Avalara to calculate the tax.
          - The memo is created from an invoice and you use Avalara or Zuora Tax to calculate the tax.

        You can update a debit memo only if you have the user permission. See [Billing Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/d_Billing_Roles) for more information.

        **Note:** The Advanced AR Settlement feature is in **Limited Availability**. This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you wish to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com/). 

        Sends a posted debit memo to the specified email addresses manually.



        ## Notes
          - You must activate the **Email Debit Memo | Manually email Debit Memo** notification before emailing debit memos. To include the debit memo PDF in the email, select the **Include Debit Memo PDF** check box in the **Edit notification** dialog from the Zuora UI. See [Create and Edit Notifications](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/Notifications/C_Create_Notifications#section_2) for more information.


          - Zuora sends the email messages based on the email template you set. You can set the email template to use in the **Delivery Options** panel of the **Edit notification** dialog from the Zuora UI. By default, the **Manual Email for Debit Memo Default Template** template is used. See [Create and Edit Email Templates](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/Notifications/Create_Email_Templates) for more information.


          - The debit memos are sent only to the work email addresses or personal email addresses of the Bill To contact if the following conditions are all met:

            * The `useEmailTemplateSetting` field is set to `false`.
            * The email addresses are not specified in the `emailAddresses` field.

            This parameter restricts the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to filter on.

             A single filter uses the following form: 

            *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value*
                        
            Filters can be combined by using `&`. For example: *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value* `&` *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value*

            *fieldsFilterable* indicates the name of a supported field that you can use to filter the response data. The supported filterable fields of this operation are as below:

              - id
              - amount
              - beAppliedAmount
              - sku
              - skuName
              - serviceStartDate
              - serviceEndDate
              - sourceItemId
              - createdDate
              - createdById
              - updatedDate
              - updatedById
              - subscriptionId

             *field_value* indicates a valid value of the filterable field. If the type of the field value is string, you can set the field to `null` value for filtering. Then, you can get the response data with this field value being 'null'. For more information about these fields, see the field descriptions in the **Responses** section. 
              
            Examples:

            - /debitmemos/402890245c7ca371015c7cb40b28001f/items?amount=100

            - /debitmemos/402890245c7ca371015c7cb40b28001f/items?amount=100&sort=createdDate

            This parameter restricts the order of the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to sort on.

            A sortable field uses the following form: 

            *operator* *field_name*

            You can use at most two sortable fields in one URL path. Use a comma to separate sortable fields. For example:  *operator* *field_name*, *operator* *field_name*  

            *operator* is used to mark the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field.

              - The `-` operator indicates an ascending order.
              - The `+` operator indicates a descending order.

            By default, the response data is displayed in descending order by updated date.

            *field_name* indicates the name of a sortable field. The supported sortable fields of this operation are as below:

              - id
              - amount
              - beAppliedAmount
              - sku
              - skuName
              - serviceStartDate
              - serviceEndDate
              - sourceItemId
              - createdDate
              - createdById
              - updatedDate
              - updatedById
              - subscriptionId

    get:
      description: |
        Provides a reference listing of each object that is available in your Zuora tenant.

        The information returned by this call is useful if you are using [CRUD: Create Export](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Object_POSTExport) or the [AQuA API](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/T_Aggregate_Query_API) to create a data source export. See [Export ZOQL](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/M_Export_ZOQL) for more information.

        ## Response
        The response contains an XML document that lists the fields of the specified object. Each of the object's fields is represented by a `<field>` element in the XML document.
            
        Each `<field>` element contains the following elements:

        | Element      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
        |--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | `<name>`     | API name of the field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
        | `<label>`    | Name of the field in the Zuora user interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
        | `<type>`     | Data type of the field. The possible data types are: `boolean`, `date`, `datetime`, `decimal`, `integer`, `picklist`, `text`, `timestamp`, and `ZOQL`. If the data type is `picklist`, the `<field>` element contains an `<options>` element that lists the possible values of the field.    |
        | `<contexts>` | Specifies the availability of the field. If the `<contexts>` element lists the `export` context, the field is available for use in data source exports.                                                                                                                                                |

        The `<field>` element contains other elements that provide legacy information about the field. This information is not directly related to the REST API.

        Response sample:
        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <object>
          <name>ProductRatePlanCharge</name>
          <label>Product Rate Plan Charge</label>
          <fields>
            ...
            <field>
              <name>TaxMode</name>
              <label>Tax Mode</label>
              <type>picklist</type>
              <options>
                <option>TaxExclusive</option>
                <option>TaxInclusive</option>
              </options>
              <contexts>
                <context>export</context>
              </contexts>
              ...
            </field>
            ...
          </fields>
        </object>
        ```

        It is strongly recommended that your integration checks `<contexts>` elements in the response. If your integration does not check `<contexts>` elements, your integration may process fields that are not available for use in data source exports. See [Changes to the Describe API](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/M_Export_ZOQL/Changes_to_the_Describe_API) for more information.

        Retrieve a file by specifying its file ID. You can retrieve accounting period reports, such as the Revenue Detail report, as well as other files such as invoice PDFs.

        ## Example

        ```curl
        curl -i -k -H "apiAccessKeyId:$USER_NAME" -H "apiSecretAccessKey:$PASSWORD"
        -H "Accept:application/pdf"

        -o /Users/jsmith/Downloads/invoiceFile1.pdf
        ```
        The invoice PDF is downloaded to /Users/jsmith/Downloads and named invoiceFile1.pdf.

        ## File Size Limitation
        The maximum export file size is 2047MB. If you have large data requests that go over this limit, you will get the following 403 HTTP response code from Zuora.

        `<security:max-object-size>2047MB</security:max-object-size>`

        Submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](https://zuora.zendesk.com/agent/) if you require additional assistance.

        We can work with you to determine if large file optimization is an option for you.

      description: |
        The hostedpages call returns the Payment Pages configuration metadata,
        specifically, page ID, page version, payment method type.

        The following are the version-specific and general REST requests for Payment Pages:

        * The request for Payment Pages 1.0 configuration information: `GET <BaseURL>/hostedpages?version=1`
        * The request for Payment Pages 2.0 configuration information: `GET <BaseURL>/hostedpages?version=2`
        * The request for all versions of Payment Pages configuration information: `GET <BaseURL>/hostedpages`

        ## Notes
        If you do not have the corresponding tenant setting enabled, e.g., the request `version` parameter set to 2 with the Payment Pages 2.0 setting disabled, you will receive an error.
      operationId: Get_HostedPages
      parameters:
        - $ref: '#/parameters/GLOBAL_HEADER_Zuora_Entity_Ids_Single'
        - $ref: '#/parameters/GLOBAL_REQUEST_pageSize'
        - description: |
            Version of the Payment Pages for which you want to retrieve the configuration information. Specify 1 for Payment Pages 1.0 or 2 for Payment Pages 2.0. If omitted, information for all versions of Payment Pages are returned.

            The response also depends on your tenant settings for Payment Pages 1.0 and Payment Pages 2.0. For example, if only the tenant setting for Payment Pages 2.0 is enabled, the response will only contain information for Payment Pages 2.0 forms even when this parameter is omitted.

You can set the email template to use in the **Delivery Options** panel of the **Edit notification** dialog from the Zuora UI. By default, the **Invoice Posted Default Email Template** template is used. See [Create and Edit Email Templates](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/Notifications/Create_Email_Templates) for more information.

        This REST API reference describes how to manually create a summary journal entry. Request and response field descriptions and sample code are provided.
        ## Requirements
        1.The sum of debits must equal the sum of credits in the summary journal entry.

        2.The following applies only if you use foreign currency conversion:
          * If you have configured Aggregate transactions with different currencies during a Journal Run to "Yes", the value of the **currency** field must be the same as your tenant's home currency. That is, you must create journal entries using your home currency.
          * All journal entries in an accounting period must either all be aggregated or all be unaggregated. You cannot have a mix of aggregated and unaggregated journal entries in the same accounting period.

      description: |
        This reference describes how to cancel a journal run using the REST API.
                  
        The summary journal entries in the journal run are canceled asynchronously. See the "Example" section below for details.
                  
        You must have the "Cancel Journal Run" Zuora Finance user permission enabled to cancel journal runs.

        ## Notes
        When you cancel a journal run, the summary journal entries associated with that journal run are canceled asynchronously. A response of `{ "success": true }` means only that the specified journal run has a status of "Pending", "Error", or "Completed" and therefore can be canceled, but does not mean that the whole journal run was successfully canceled.

        For example, let's say you want to cancel journal run JR-00000075. The journal run status is "Completed" and it contains ten journal entries. One of the journal entries has its Transferred to Accounting status set to "Yes", meaning that the entry cannot be canceled. The workflow might go as follows:
        1. You make an API call to cancel the journal run.
        2. The journal run status is "Completed", so you receive a response of `{ "success": true }`.
        3. Zuora begins asynchronously canceling journal entries associated with the journal run. The journal entry whose Transferred to Accounting status is "Yes" fails to be canceled. The cancelation process continues, and the other journal entries are successfully canceled.
        4. The journal run status remains as "Completed". The status does not change to "Canceled" because the journal run still contains a journey entry that is not canceled.

        * This feature is unavailable if you have the Orders feature enabled. See [Orders Migration Guidance](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AB_Orders_Migration_Guidance) for more information.
        * This operation has some limitations. If you do not have the Orders feature enabled, Zuora recommends that you use [Update subscription](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/PUT_Subscription) to amend subscriptions. If you need to create an Amendment object, Zuora recommends that you use [Amend](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Action_POSTamend) instead of CRUD: Create Amendment.

        ## Post a Bill Run

        Posting a bill run is an asynchronous operation. To post a bill run, the current bill run must have a status of `Completed`.

        When a bill run is posted, its status is changed to `PostInProgress`. Once all invoices for this bill run are posted then its status is changed to `Posted`.   

        When you post a bill run and query the status of a bill run, you will get one of the following results `PostInProgress`, `Completed`, or `Posted`. If all invoices in the bill run are posted, then the status of the bill run is `Posted`. If one or more invoices fail to post, the status will change back to `Completed` and you will need to post the bill run again.

        ## Cancel a Bill Run

        Canceling a bill run is an asynchronous operation. When canceling a bill run, the logic is the same as when using the UI to cancel a bill run. You need to provide the `BillRunId`, and set the Status to `Canceled`. 

        When canceling a bill run, consider the following:

        * Canceling a bill run with a `Completed` status.
          * Only the current bill run will be canceled.
        * Canceling a bill run with a `Pending` status.
          * When canceling an Ad-hoc bill run, only the current bill run will be canceled.
          * When canceling a scheduled bill, all scheduled bill runs will be canceled.

        The Cancel operation may not be successful. Its success depends on its current business validation. Only a bill run that has no posted invoices can be canceled. If any posted invoices belong to the bill run then an invalid value exception will be thrown with the message, "The Bill Run cannot be Cancelled, There are Posted invoices."

        This REST API reference describes how to retrieve a Payment Method Snapshot.

        A Payment Method Snapshot is a copy of the particular Payment Method used in a transaction. If the Payment Method is deleted, the Payment Method Snapshot continues to retain the data used in each of the past transactions.

        ## Notes
        The following Payment Method fields are not available in Payment Method Snapshots:

        * `Active`
        * `AchAddress1`
        * `AchAddress2`
        * `CreatedById`
        * `CreatedDate`
        * `UpdatedById`
        * `UpdatedDate`

        The Payment Method Snapshot field `PaymentMethodId` is not available in Payment Methods.

        Generates a preview of future invoice items for one customer account. Use the BillingPreview call to calculate how much a single customer will be invoiced from the most recent invoice to a specific end of term date in the future.

        Additionally, you can use the BillingPreview service to access real-time data on an individual customer's usage consumption. 

        The BillingPreview call does not calculate taxes for charges in the subscription.

        If you have the Advanced AR Settlement feature enabled, you can also generate a preview of future credit memo items for one customer account. The Advanced AR Settlement feature is in **Limited Availability**. If you wish to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com/).

      description: |
        Generates and posts invoices and credit memos and collects payments for posted invoices. Credit memos are only available if you have the Advanced AR Settlement feature enabled and negative charges exist. Credit memos will not be applied to invoices. If draft invoices and credit memos exist when you run this operation, this operation will post the invoices and credit memos. Note that draft credit memos created from an invoice or a product rate plan charge will not be posted.

        You can use this operation to generate invoices and collect payments on the posted invoices,
         or else simply collect payment on a specified existing
        invoice. The customer's default payment method is used, and the full
        amount due is collected. The operation depends on the parameters you
        specify.

        - To generate one or more new invoices for that customer and collect
        payment on the generated and other unpaid invoice(s), leave the **invoiceId** field empty. 

        - To collect payment on an existing invoice, specify the invoice ID. 


        The operation is atomic; if any part is unsuccessful, the entire
        operation is rolled back.

        When an error occurs, gateway reason codes and error messages are returned the error response of this operation. The following items are some gateway response code examples.

        - Orbital: `05 Do Not Honor`; `14 Invalid Credit Card Number`
        - Vantiv: `301 Invalid Account Number`; `304 Lost/Stolen Card`  
        - CyberSource2: `202 Expired card`; `231 Invalid account number`

        For more reason code information, see the corresponding payment gateway documentation. 


        ## Notes

        Timeouts may occur when using this method on an account that
        has an extremely high number of subscriptions.

        Retrieves the information about all payment runs. You can define filterable fields to restrict the data returned in the response.
      operationId: GET_PaymentRuns
      parameters:

        - $ref: '#/parameters/GLOBAL_REQUEST_pageSize'
        - description: |
            This parameter restricts the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to filter on.

            A single filter uses the following form: 

            *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value*
                        
            Filters can be combined by using `&`. For example: *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value* `&` *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value*

            *fieldsFilterable* indicates the name of a supported field that you can use to filter the response data. The supported filterable fields of this operation are as below:

              - targetDate
              - status
              - createdDate
              - createdById
              - updatedDate
              - updatedById

             *field_value* indicates a valid value of the filterable field. If the type of the field value is string, you can set the field to `null` value for filtering. Then, you can get the response data with this field value being `null`. For more information about these fields, see the field descriptions in the **Responses** section. 
              
            Examples:

            - /payment-runs?status=Processed

            - /payment-runs?targetDate=2017-10-10&status=Pending

            - /payment-runs?status=Completed&sort=+updatedDate

          type: string
        - description: |
            This parameter restricts the order of the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to sort on.

            A sortable field uses the following form: 

            *operator* *field_name*

            You can use at most two sortable fields in one URL path. Use a comma to separate sortable fields. For example:  *operator* *field_name*, *operator* *field_name*  

            *operator* is used to mark the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field.

              - The `-` operator indicates an ascending order.
              - The `+` operator indicates a descending order.

            By default, the response data is displayed in descending order by payment run number.

            *field_name* indicates the name of a sortable field. The supported sortable fields of this operation are as below:

              - targetDate
              - status
              - createdDate
              - createdById
              - updatedDate
              - updatedById

            Examples:

            - /payment-runs?sort=+createdDate

            - /payment-runs?status=Processing&sort=-createdById,+targetDate

        Creates a payment run. You can create a payment run to be executed immediately after it is created, or a scheduced payment run to be executed in future.

        The `accountId`, `batch`, `billCycleDay`, `currency`, `paymentGatewayId`, and `billingRunId` fields are used to determine which receivables to be paid in the payment run. If none of these fields is specified in the request body, the corresponding payment run collects payments for all accounts.

            This parameter restricts the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to filter on.

             A single filter uses the following form: 

            *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value*
                        
            Filters can be combined by using `&`. For example: *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value* & *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value*

            *fieldsFilterable* indicates the name of a supported field that you can use to filter the response data. The supported filterable fields of this operation are as below:

              - number
              - status
              - type
              - accountId
              - amount
              - appliedAmount
              - unappliedAmount
              - refundAmount
              - creditBalanceAmount
              - currency
              - effectiveDate
              - createdDate
              - createdById
              - updatedDate
              - updatedById

             *field_value* indicates a valid value of the filterable field. If the type of the field value is string, you can set the field to `null` value for filtering. Then, you can get the response data with this field value being 'null'. For more information about these fields, see the field descriptions in the **Responses** section. 
              
            Examples:

            - /payments?status=Processed

            - /payments?currency=USD&status=Processed

            - /payments?status=Processed&type=External&sort=+number
          in: query
          name: fieldsFilterable
          required: false
          type: string

            This parameter restricts the order of the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to sort on.

            A sortable field uses the following form: 

            *operator* *field_name*

            You can use at most two sortable fields in one URL path. Use a comma to separate sortable fields. For example:  *operator* *field_name*, *operator* *field_name*  

            *operator* is used to mark the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field.

              - The `-` operator indicates an ascending order.
              - The `+` operator indicates a descending order.

            By default, the response data is displayed in descending order by payment number.

            *field_name* indicates the name of a sortable field. The supported sortable fields of this operation are as below:

              - number
              - accountId
              - amount
              - appliedAmount
              - unappliedAmount
              - refundAmount
              - creditBalanceAmount
              - effectiveDate
              - createdDate
              - createdById
              - updatedDate
              - updatedById
              
            Examples:

            - /payments?sort=+number

            - /payments?status=Processed&sort=-number,+amount

        **Note:** The Advanced AR Settlement feature is in **Limited Availability**. This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you wish to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com/). 

        Creates a payment for the following scenarios:

        - A full payment on an invoice or debit memo
        - A partial payment
        - A payment for several invoices and debit memos
        - An unapplied payment 

        If you do not know to which customer account the payment belongs, you can create a payment without specifying a customer account.

        The `document` call generates a quote document and returns the generated document URL. You can directly access the generated quote file through the returned URL.

        The `document` call should be only used from Zuora Quotes. 

        ## File Size Limitation 
        The maximum export file size is 2047MB. If you have large data requests that go over this limit, you will get the following 403 HTTP response code from Zuora:
        `security:max-object-size>2047MB</security:max-object-size>`

        Submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com/) if you require additional assistance.

        We can work with you to determine if large file optimization is an option for you.

            This parameter restricts the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to filter on.

             A single filter uses the following form: 

            *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value*
                        
            Filters can be combined by using `&`. For example: *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value* `&` *fieldsFilterable* `=` *field_value*

            *fieldsFilterable* indicates the name of a supported field that you can use to filter the response data. The supported filterable fields of this operation are as below:

              - number
              - status
              - type
              - accountId
              - amount
              - refundDate
              - paymentId
              - createdDate
              - createdById
              - updatedDate
              - updatedById
              - methodType

             *field_value* indicates a valid value of the filterable field. If the type of the field value is string, you can set the field to `null` value for filtering. Then, you can get the response data with this field value being 'null'. For more information about these fields, see the field descriptions in the **Responses** section. 
              
            Examples:

            - /refunds?status=Processed

            - /refunds?amount=4&status=Processed

            - /refunds?status=Processed&type=External&sort=+number

            This parameter restricts the order of the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to sort on.

            A sortable field uses the following form: 

            *operator* *field_name*

            You can use at most two sortable fields in one URL path. Use a comma to separate sortable fields. For example:  *operator* *field_name*, *operator* *field_name*  

            *operator* is used to mark the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field.

              - The `-` operator indicates an ascending order.
              - The `+` operator indicates a descending order.

            By default, the response data is displayed in descending order by refund number.

            *field_name* indicates the name of a sortable field. The supported sortable fields of this operation are as below:

              - number
              - accountId
              - amount
              - refundDate
              - paymentId
              - createdDate
              - createdById
              - updatedDate
              - updatedById
              
            Examples:

The POST rsa_signatures call generates and returns the required digital signature and token for a Payment Pages 2.0 form. You need to pass the generated signature to your client for it to access Payment Pages 2.0.

        The REST API used in Payment Pages 2.0 are CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) enabled and therefore requires a digital signature. You use rsa_signatures to generate the required digital signature and token for a Payment Pages 2.0 form, and then you use the decrypt REST service to decrypt the signature to validate the signature and key.

        This REST service should be used only when you implement Payment Pages 2.0.

            The segmented rate plan charges.

            When an amendment results in a change to a charge, Zuora creates a segmented rate plan charge. Use this field to track segment charges.

            Possible values are:

            * __last-segment__: (Default) The last rate plan charge on the subscription. The last rate plan charge is the last one in the order of time on the subscription rather than the most recent changed charge on the subscription.
             * __current-segment__: The segmented charge that is active on today’s date (effectiveStartDate <= today’s date < effectiveEndDate).
             
             * __all-segments__: All the segmented charges. The `chargeSegments` field is returned in the response. The `chargeSegments` field contains an array of the charge information for all the charge segments.

             * __specific-segment&as-of-date=date__: The segmented charge that is active on a date you specified (effectiveStartDate <= specific date < effectiveEndDate). The format of the date is yyyy-mm-dd.

      description: |
        The REST API reference describes how to create a new subscription in preview mode. This call does not require a valid customer account. It can be used to show potential new customers a preview of a subscription with complete details and charges before creating an account, or to let existing customers preview a subscription with all charges before committing.

        ## Notes
        - This feature is unavailable if you have the Orders feature enabled. See [Orders Migration Guidance](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AB_Orders_Migration_Guidance) for more information.
        - The response of the Preview Subscription call is based on the REST API minor version you set in the request header. The response structure might be different if you use different minor version numbers. 

        - If you have the Advanced AR Settlement feature enabled, we recommend that you set the `zuora-version` parameter to `207.0` or later. Otherwise, an error is returned.


        - Default values for **customerAcceptanceDate** and **serviceActivationDate** are set as follows.

        |        | serviceActivationDate (SA) specified          | serviceActivationDate (SA) NOT specified  |
        | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
        | customerAcceptanceDate (CA) specified      | SA uses value in the request call; CA uses value in the request call| CA uses value in the request call;SA uses CE as default |

            The segmented rate plan charges. When an amendment results in a change to a charge, Zuora creates a segmented rate plan charge. Use this field to track segment charges.

            Possible values are:

             * __last-segment__: (Default) The last rate plan charge on the subscription. The last rate plan charge is the last one in the order of time on the subscription rather than the most recent changed charge on the subscription.
             * __current-segment__: The segmented charge that is active on today’s date (effectiveStartDate <= today’s date < effectiveEndDate).
             
             * __all-segments__: All the segmented charges. The `chargeSegments` field is returned in the response. The `chargeSegments` field contains an array of the charge information for all the charge segments.

             * __specific-segment&as-of-date=date__: The segmented charge that is active on a date you specified (effectiveStartDate <= specific date < effectiveEndDate). The format of the date is yyyy-mm-dd.

        Use this call to make the following kinds of changes to a subscription:
          * Add a note
          * Change the renewal term or auto-renewal flag
          * Change the term length or change between evergreen and termed
          * Add a new product rate plan
          * Remove an existing subscription rate plan
          * Change the quantity or price of an existing subscription rate plan

        ## Notes
        * This feature is unavailable if you have the Orders feature enabled. See [Orders Migration Guidance](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AB_Orders_Migration_Guidance) for more information.
        * The Update Subscription call creates a new subscription, which has the old subscription number but a new subscription ID.  The old subscription is canceled but remains in the system.
        * In one request, this call can make:
          * Up to 9 combined add, update, and remove changes
          * No more than 1 change to terms & conditions
        * Updates are performed in the following sequence:
          1. First change the notes on the existing subscription, if requested.
          2. Then change the terms and conditions, if requested.
          3. Then perform the remaining amendments based upon the effective dates specified. If multiple amendments have the same contract-effective dates, then execute adds before updates, and updates before removes.
        * The update operation is atomic. If any of the updates fails, the entire operation is rolled back.
        * The response of the Update Subscription call is based on the REST API minor version you set in the request header. The response structure might be different if you use different minor version numbers. 
        * If you have the Advanced AR Settlement feature enabled, we recommend that you set the `zuora-version` parameter to `207.0` or later. Otherwise, an error is returned.

        ## Override a Tiered Price
        There are two ways you override a tiered price:

        * Override a specific tier number
        For example: `tiers[{tier:1,price:8},{tier:2,price:6}]`

        * Override the entire tier structure
        For example:  `tiers[{tier:1,price:8,startingUnit:1,endingUnit:100,priceFormat:"FlatFee"},
        {tier:2,price:6,startingUnit:101,priceFormat:"FlatFee"}]`

        If you just override a specific tier, do not include the `startingUnit` field in the request.

            The minor version of the Zuora REST API. 

            You need to set this parameter if you use the following fields:
            * collect
            * invoice
            * includeExistingDraftDocItems
            * previewType
            * runBilling
            * targetDate


            If you have the Advanced AR Settlement feature enabled, you need to specify this parameter. Otherwise, an error is returned.

            The segmented rate plan charges. When an amendment results in a change to a charge, Zuora creates a segmented rate plan charge. Use this field to track segment charges.

            Possible values are:

             * __last-segment__: (Default) The last rate plan charge on the subscription. The last rate plan charge is the last one in the order of time on the subscription rather than the most recent changed charge on the subscription.
             * __current-segment__: The segmented charge that is active on today’s date (effectiveStartDate <= today’s date < effectiveEndDate).
             
             * __all-segments__: All the segmented charges. The `chargeSegments` field is returned in the response. The `chargeSegments` field contains an array of the charge information for all the charge segments.

             * __specific-segment&as-of-date=date__: The segmented charge that is active on a date you specified (effectiveStartDate <= specific date < effectiveEndDate). The format of the date is yyyy-mm-dd.

  /v1/usage:
    post:
      consumes:
        - multipart/form-data
      description: |

        This REST API reference describes how to post or import usage data for one or more accounts in the CSV  format. There are no path or query parameters. The data is uploade using the HTTP multipart/form-data POST method and applied to the user's tenant. 

        ## How this REST API Call Works
        The content of the upload file must follow the format used by the UI import tool. It must be a comma-separated (CSV) file with a corresponding .csv extension. The length of the file name must not exceed 50 characters. The file size must not exceed 4MB. Click [here](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/@api/deki/files/4105/UsageFileFormat.csv) to download the usage file template.

        At the completion of the upload, before actually processing the file contents, theAPI returns a response containing the byte count of the received file and a URL for checking the status of the import process.  Of the five possible results displayed at that URL Pending, Processing, Completed, Canceled, and Failed) only a Completed status indicates that the import was successful.  The operation is atomic; if any record fails, the file is rejected.  In that case, the entire import is rolled back and all stored data is returned to its original state.

        To view the actual import status, enter the resulting status URL from the checkImportStatus response using a tool such as POSTMAN.This additional step provides more information about why the import may have failed.

        To manage the information after a successful upload, use the web-based UI.

        ## Upload File Format
        The upload file uses the following headings:

        | Heading         | Description   | Required |
        |-----------------|--------|----------|
        | ACCOUNT_ID      | Enter the account number, e.g., the default account number, such as A00000001, or your custom account number.,Although this field is labeled as Account_Id, it is not the actual Account ID nor Account Name.  | Yes      |
        | UOM             | Enter the unit of measure. This must match the UOM for the usage. | Yes      |
        | QTY             | Enter the quantity.  | Yes      |
        | STARTDATE       | Enter the start date of the usage.,This date determines the invoice item service period the associated usage is billed to. Date format is based on locale of the current user. Default date format: `MM/DD/YYYY` | Yes      |
        | ENDDATE         | Enter the end date of the usage.,This is not used in calculations for usage billing and is optional. Date format is based on locale of the current user. Default date format: `MM/DD/YYYY`    | Yes      |
        | SUBSCRIPTION_ID | Enter the subscription number or subscription name. If you created the subscription in the Zuora application, Zuora created a number automatically in a format similar to A-S00000001. If you do not provide a value for this field, the associated usage will be added to all subscriptions for the specified Account that use this Unit Of Measure. If your Accounts can have multiple subscriptions and you do not want double or triple counting of usage, you must specify the Subscription or Charge ID in each usage record.  | Yes      |
        | CHARGE_ID       | Enter the charge number (not the charge name). You can see the charge ID, e.g., C-00000001, when you add your rate plan to your subscription and view your individual charges. If your Accounts can have multiple subscriptions and you do not want double or triple counting of usage, you must specify the specific Subscription or Charge ID in each usage record. This field is related to the Charge Number on the subscription rate plan.                       | Yes      |
        | DESCRIPTION     | Enter a description for the charge. | No       |

          - `ByBillingPeriod` (default): The rating is based on all the usages in a billing period.
          - `ByUsageStartDate`: The rating is based on all the usages on the same usage start date. 
          - `ByUsageRecord`: The rating is based on each usage record.
          - `ByUsageUpload`: The rating is based on all the  usages in a uploaded usage file (`.xls` or `.csv`).
          - `ByGroupId`: The rating is based on all the usages in a custom group.

          Specifies the smoothing model for an overage smoothing charge model or an tiered with overage model, which is an advanced type of a usage model that avoids spikes in usage charges. If a customer's usage spikes in a single period, then an overage smoothing model eases overage charges by considering usage and multiple periods.

          One of the following values shows which smoothing model will be applied to the charge when `Overage` or `Tiered with Overage` is used:

          - `RollingWindow` considers a number of periods to smooth usage. The rolling window starts and increments forward based on billing frequency. When allowed usage is met, then period resets and a new window begins.
          - `Rollover` considers a fixed number of periods before calculating usage. The net balance at the end of a period is unused usage, which is carried over to the next period's balance.

        description: |
          The filter rule conditions, written in [JEXL](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/).
          The rule might contain event context merge fields and data source merge fields. Data source merge fields must be from [the base object of the event or from the joined objects of the base object](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/M_Export_ZOQL#Data_Sources_and_Objects). The notifications containing invalid merge fields will fail to evaluate, thus will not be invoked. For example, to trigger an event when an invoice is posted with the amount over 1000, you would define the following condition on the `Invoice` object:

          ```changeType == 'UPDATE' && Invoice.Status == 'Posted' && Invoice.Status_old != 'Posted' && Invoice.Amount > 1000```


          There are conventions and keywords you need to be aware of. For example:

          * `changeType` is a keyword to specify what kind of change happened to the object. Allowed values are `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE`.

          * `Invoice.Status` refers to field `Status` of Zuora object `Invoice`.

          * A variable with the `_old` suffix means it’s a previous value of the corresponding object field. The "_old" fields are only available on the base objects.
        example: Account.Balance >= _VIP_BALANCE_AMOUNT && Account.Status == _ACCOUNT_STATUS

          The filter rule conditions, written in [JEXL](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/).
          The rule might contain event context merge fields and data source merge fields. Data source merge fields must be from [the base object of the event or from the joined objects of the base object](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/M_Export_ZOQL#Data_Sources_and_Objects). Notifications with invalid merge fields will fail to evaluate, thus will not be invoked. For example, to trigger an event when an invoice is posted with the amount over 1000, you would define the following condition on the `Invoice` object:

          ```changeType == 'UPDATE' && Invoice.Status == 'Posted' && Invoice.Status_old != 'Posted' && Invoice.Amount > 1000```

          There are conventions and keywords you need to be aware of. For example:

          * `changeType` is a keyword to specify what kind of change happened to the object. Allowed values are `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE`.

          * `Invoice.Status` refers to field `Status` of the Zuora object `Invoice`.

          * A variable with the `_old` suffix means it’s a previous value of the corresponding object field. The "_old" fields are only available on the base objects.
        example: Account.Balance >= _VIP_BALANCE_AMOUNT && Account.Status == _ACCOUNT_STATUS

          The filter rule condition, written in [JEXL](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/).
          The rule might contain event context merge fields and data source merge fields. Data source merge fields must be from [the base object of the event or from the joined objects of the base object](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/M_Export_ZOQL#Data_Sources_and_Objects). Notifications containing invalid merge fields will fail to evaluate, thus are will not be invoked. For example, to trigger an event when an invoice is posted with the amount over 1000, you would define the following condition on the `Invoice` object:

          ```changeType == 'UPDATE' && Invoice.Status == 'Posted' && Invoice.Status_old != 'Posted' && Invoice.Amount > 1000```


          There are conventions and keywords you need to be aware of. For example:

          * `changeType` is a keyword to specify what kind of change happened to the object. Allowed values are `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE`.

          * `Invoice.Status` refers to field `Status` of Zuora object `Invoice`.

          * A variable with the `_old` suffix means it’s a previous value of the corresponding object field. The "_old" fields are only available on the base objects.
        example: Account.Balance >= _VIP_BALANCE_AMOUNT && Account.Status == _ACCOUNT_STATUS

              The filter rule conditions, written in [JEXL](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/).
              The rule might contain event context merge fields and data source merge fields. Data source merge fields must be from [the base object of the event or from the joined objects of the base object](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/M_Export_ZOQL#Data_Sources_and_Objects). Notifications with invalid merge fields will fail to evaluate, thus will not be invoked. For example, to trigger an event when an invoice is posted with the amount over 1000, you would define the following condition on the `Invoice` object:

              ```changeType == 'UPDATE' && Invoice.Status == 'Posted' && Invoice.Status_old != 'Posted' && Invoice.Amount > 1000```

              There are conventions and keywords you need to be aware of. For example:

              * `changeType` is a keyword to specify what kind of change happened to the object. Allowed values are `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE`.

              * `Invoice.Status` refers to field `Status` of the Zuora object `Invoice`.

              * A variable with the `_old` suffix means it’s a previous value of the corresponding object field. The "_old" fields are only available on the base objects.
            example: Account.Balance >= _VIP_BALANCE_AMOUNT && Account.Status == _ACCOUNT_STATUS

This ID can also be used to do reconciliation and tie the payment to a natural key in external systems. The source of this ID varies by merchant. Some merchants use their shopping cart order IDs, and others use something different. Merchants use this ID to track transactions in their eCommerce systems.

                   The date when the subscription is activated.
                  This field can be updated when **Status** is `Draft`. This field is only required if the [Require Service Activation of Orders?](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Billing_Settings/Define_Default_Subscription_Settings#Require_Service_Activation_of_Orders.3F) Setting is set to `Yes`.
                  If this setting is set to `Yes`:

                  - If ContractAcceptanceDate field is required, you must set this field, ContractAcceptanceDate, and ContractEffectiveDate fields in the subscribe call to activate a subscription.
                  - If ContractAcceptanceDate field is not required, you must set both this field and the ContractEffectiveDate field in the subscribe call to activate a subscription. If you only set a valid date in the ContractEffectiveDate field, the subscribe call still returns success, but the subscription is in `DRAT` status.
