# BaseAlternateCode

Code that specifies whether a record is a base (preferred) or alternate record.  Base records (represented as \"B\") can represent a range of addresses or an individual address, such as a firm record, while alternate records (represented as \"A\") are individual delivery points. Base records are generally preferred over alternate records. Government deliveries will only be listed on alternate records with the appropriate government building indicator (federal, state, or city) set.

## Enum

* `A` (value: `'A'`)

* `B` (value: `'B'`)

* `EMPTY` (value: `''`)
