The Eircode is always the last line of a Postal Address generated within the state, e.g. if an address has four lines then the Eircode will be on its own on Address Line 5. For inbound international mail the country name IRELAND should be appended as the last line of the Postal Address. |

**post_county** | **str** | One of the 26 Counties in the Republic of Ireland. These counties are sub-national divisions used for the purposes of administrative, geographical and political demarcation. Post County is the County associated with the Post Town, not the geographic county in which the building is located. The Post County is normally used as part of the Postal Address with some exceptions e.g. Dublin Postal Districts where the Post County is not used and some Post Towns (e.g. Tipperary, Kildare, etc.) that have the same name as the Post County. | 
**primary_locality** | **str** | First locality elements which can refer to areas, districts, industrial estates, towns, etc.  The primary locality refers to the specific place the address is.  In urban areas, the primary locality can be required to distinguish between two thoroughfares of the same name in the same district or town. Industrial estates with named thoroughfares are also held as localities. In rural areas the primary locality is generally a townland name. | 
**primary_thoroughfare** | **str** | The name of the thoroughfare on which premises are located. It may appear on a line by itself or be appended to either a sub building or building number.  Addresses with thoroughfares can sometimes have the thoroughfare excluded where a Building Group exists, such as a Retail Centre or Business Park, and the thoroughfare is not part of the Postal Address. | 
**secondary_locality** | **str** | Never present without a primary locality. The secondary locality has a wider geographic scope than the primary locality.  It is the secondary locality therefore which differentiates addresses with the same primary locality name within the same county.  Secondary localities are more likely to be required for rural addresses.  Second locality elements which can refer to areas, districts, industrial estates, towns, etc  The secondary locality helps identify where the primary locality is located. | 
**secondary_thoroughfare** | **str** | It is never present without a primary thoroughfare. The primary thoroughfare is dependent on the secondary thoroughfare and appears before the secondary thoroughfare in any address.  Secondary thoroughfare are generally used to assist locating a primary thoroughfare. | 
**sub_building_name** | **str** | When a premise is split into individual units such as flats, apartments or business units. Cannot be present without either building_name or building_number. E.g. Flat 1, A, 10B | 
**tertiary_locality** | **str** | Also known as the Post Town.  The name of the post town associated with the premises for postal delivery purposes. This includes Dublin Postal Districts \&quot;Dublin 1\&quot; to \&quot;Dublin 24\&quot;.  The post town is a significant element of the Postal Address, however it is not always populated in an address. The official post office guide, Eola√≠ an Phoist4, describes post towns in the following manner:  \&quot;A provincial postal address may include the name of a town or village several miles distant, with which the addressee has little or no connection, and, in some places, especially if this residence happens to be near a county boundary, the name of the neighbouring county instead of the county in which he actually resides. The explanation is that the main mail despatches have to be sent for more detailed sub division to certain centres known as POST TOWNS, chosen because of their accessibility and convenience.\&quot; |

This is a special case where the residential and non residential addresses in the building are essentially the same address. The typical example is a farm house on an active farm. It is important to note that this is a special case. In general a building with both residential and non-residential addresses (e.g. an apartment over a shop) will receive two address points, one commercial and one residential, and hence two Eircodes.  Buildings can contain multiple address points of type Residential and/or Non-Residential. | 
**building_address_type** | **str** | The building type can assume one of the following values:  - Single Occupancy Residential Building. This type of building contains one residential address. - Multi Occupancy Residential Building.

Ireland has a very high level of non-unique addresses (NUA), i.e. the address does not contain a unique building number or name. Approximately 35% of all Irish addresses are non-unique which equates to 600,000 addresses.  The typical example of NUA addressing is where every address in a townland is the same. The way that post is delivered is by local knowledge of postal delivery personnel of which addressee lives in which house.  N.B. For a NUA address, it is impossible to match to a unique record in the ECAD and assign an Eircode. |

If there is no Unitary Authority, the County name is used. This information is not static, because County boundaries may change due to administrative changes. Data  source: ONS | 
**county** | **str** | Since postal, administrative or traditional counties may not apply to some addresses, the county field is designed to return whatever county data is available. Normally, the postal county is returned. If this is not present, the county field will fall back to the administrative county.

**delivery_point_suffix** | **str** | A unique Royal Mail 2-character code (the first numeric &amp; the second alphabetical), which, when added to the Postcode, enables each live Delivery Point to be uniquely identified. Once the Delivery Point is deleted from PAF the DPS may be reused (although they aren‚Äôt reused until all remaining Delivery Points in the range have been allocated).

**postal_county** | **str** | Postal counties were used for the distribution of mail before the Postcode system was introduced in the 1970s. The Former Postal County was the Administrative County at the time. This data rarely changes. May be empty. | 
**postcode** | **str** | Correctly formatted postcode. Capitalised and spaced. | 
**postcode_inward** | **str** | The second part of a postcode is known as the inward code. e.g. The inward code of ID1 1QD is 1QD.  The number identifies the sector in the postal district. The number is followed by 2 letters. The letters then define one or more properties in that sector. | 
**postcode_outward** | **str** | The first part of a postcode is known as the outward code. e.g. The outward code of ID1 1QD is ID1. Enables mail to be sorted to the correct local area for delivery. This part of the code contains the area and the district to which the mail is to be delivered, e.g. ‚ÄòPO1‚Äô, ‚ÄòSW1A‚Äô or ‚ÄòB23‚Äô. | 
**postcode_type** | **str** |  | 
**premise** | **str** | A pre-computed string which sensibly combines building_number, building_name and sub_building_name. building_number, building_name and sub_building_name represent raw data from Royal Mail&#39;s and can be difficult to parse if you are unaware of how the Postcode Address File premise fields work together. For this reason, we also provide a pre-computed premise field which intelligently gathers these points into a single, simple premise string. This field is ideal if you want to pull premise information and thoroughfare information separately instead of using our address lines data. | 
**su_organisation_indicator** | **str** | Small User Organisation Indicator can have the values &#39;Y&#39; or space. A value of &#39;Y&#39; indicates that a Small User Organisation is present at this address. | 
**thoroughfare** | **str** | Also known as the street or road name. In general each Thoroughfare Name will have a separate Postcode. Longer Thoroughfares with high number ranges often have multiple Postcodes covering the entire length of the road, with breaks at suitable points e.g. junctions or natural breaks in the road. | 
**traditional_county** | **str** | Traditional counties are provided by the Association of British Counties. It is historical data, and can date from the 1800s. May be empty. | 
**udprn** | **int** | UDPRN stands for ‚ÄòUnique Delivery Point Reference Number‚Äô. Royal Mail assigns a unique UDPRN code for each premise on PAF. Simple, unique reference number for each Delivery Point. Unlikely to be reused when an address expires.  Up to 8-digit numeric code.  A new UDPRN is automatically assigned to each new Delivery Point added to PAF. | 
**umprn** | [**PafUmprn**](PafUmprn.md) |  | 
**uprn** | **str** | UPRN stands for Unique Property Reference Number and is maintained by the Ordnance Survey (OS). Local governments in the UK have allocated a unique number for each land or property.  Up to 12 digits in length.  Multiple Residence premises currently share the same UPRN as the parent premise.  May not be available for a small number of Great Britain addresses due to longer update cycles for Ordnance Survey&#39;s AddressBase datasets. Returns empty string \&quot;\&quot; in these instances.  Although UPRN takes an integer format, we encode and transmit this data as strings. As a 12 digit number, the UPRN can exceed the maximum safe integer &#x60;Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER&#x60; in most browsers causing this datapoint to be corrupted.  Take special care when storing UPRN. As a 12 digit identifier, you will need 64 bits to encode every possible UPRN value. This means applications like Excel will corrupt cells containing UPRN values. | 
**ward** | **str** | The current administrative/electoral area to which the postcode has been assigned. May be empty for a small number of addresses. | 
**native** | [**AddressBaseCore**](AddressBaseCore.md) |  |
