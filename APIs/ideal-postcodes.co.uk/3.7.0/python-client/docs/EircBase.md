These counties are sub-national divisions used for the purposes of administrative, geographical and political demarcation. Post County is the County associated with the Post Town, not the geographic county in which the building is located. The Post County is normally used as part of the Postal Address with some exceptions e.g. Dublin Postal Districts where the Post County is not used and some Post Towns (e.g. Tipperary, Kildare, etc.) that have the same name as the Post County. | 
**primary_locality** | **str** | First locality elements which can refer to areas, districts, industrial estates, towns, etc.  The primary locality refers to the specific place the address is.  In urban areas, the primary locality can be required to distinguish between two thoroughfares of the same name in the same district or town. Industrial estates with named thoroughfares are also held as localities. In rural areas the primary locality is generally a townland name. | 
**primary_thoroughfare** | **str** | The name of the thoroughfare on which premises are located. It may appear on a line by itself or be appended to either a sub building or building number.  Addresses with thoroughfares can sometimes have the thoroughfare excluded where a Building Group exists, such as a Retail Centre or Business Park, and the thoroughfare is not part of the Postal Address. | 
**secondary_locality** | **str** | Never present without a primary locality. The secondary locality has a wider geographic scope than the primary locality.  It is the secondary locality therefore which differentiates addresses with the same primary locality name within the same county.  Secondary localities are more likely to be required for rural addresses.  Second locality elements which can refer to areas, districts, industrial estates, towns, etc  The secondary locality helps identify where the primary locality is located. | 
**secondary_thoroughfare** | **str** | It is never present without a primary thoroughfare.

**tertiary_locality** | **str** | Also known as the Post Town.  The name of the post town associated with the premises for postal delivery purposes. This includes Dublin Postal Districts \&quot;Dublin 1\&quot; to \&quot;Dublin 24\&quot;.  The post town is a significant element of the Postal Address, however it is not always populated in an address. The official post office guide, Eola√≠ an Phoist4, describes post towns in the following manner:  \&quot;A provincial postal address may include the name of a town or village several miles distant, with which the addressee has little or no connection, and, in some places, especially if this residence happens to be near a county boundary, the name of the neighbouring county instead of the county in which he actually resides. The explanation is that the main mail despatches have to be sent for more detailed sub division to certain centres known as POST TOWNS, chosen because of their accessibility and convenience.\&quot; | 

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.eirc_base import EircBase

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of EircBase from a JSON string
eirc_base_instance = EircBase.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(EircBase.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
eirc_base_dict = eirc_base_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of EircBase from a dict
eirc_base_from_dict = EircBase.from_dict(eirc_base_dict)
