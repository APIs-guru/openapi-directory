**primary_locality** | **str** | First locality elements which can refer to areas, districts, industrial estates, towns, etc.  The primary locality refers to the specific place the address is.  In urban areas, the primary locality can be required to distinguish between two thoroughfares of the same name in the same district or town.

**secondary_locality** | **str** | Never present without a primary locality. The secondary locality has a wider geographic scope than the primary locality.  It is the secondary locality therefore which differentiates addresses with the same primary locality name within the same county.

The post town is a significant element of the Postal Address, however it is not always populated in an address. The official post office guide, Eola√≠ an Phoist4, describes post towns in the following manner:  \&quot;A provincial postal address may include the name of a town or village several miles distant, with which the addressee has little or no connection, and, in some places, especially if this residence happens to be near a county boundary, the name of the neighbouring county instead of the county in which he actually resides. The explanation is that the main mail despatches have to be sent for more detailed sub division to certain centres known as POST TOWNS, chosen because of their accessibility and convenience.\&quot; |

This is a special case where the residential and non residential addresses in the building are essentially the same address. The typical example is a farm house on an active farm. It is important to note that this is a special case. In general a building with both residential and non-residential addresses (e.g. an apartment over a shop) will receive two address points, one commercial and one residential, and hence two Eircodes.  Buildings can contain multiple address points of type Residential and/or Non-Residential. |

Ireland has a very high level of non-unique addresses (NUA), i.e. the address does not contain a unique building number or name. Approximately 35% of all Irish addresses are non-unique which equates to 600,000 addresses.  The typical example of NUA addressing is where every address in a townland is the same.
