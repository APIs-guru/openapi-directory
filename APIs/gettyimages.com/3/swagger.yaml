The following fields are provided for every image in your result set when you include **summary_set** in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"images\": \r\n    [\r\n        \"asset_family\",\r\n        \"caption\",\r\n        \"collection_code\",\r\n        \"collection_id\",\r\n        \"collection_name\",\r\n        \"display_sizes\": \r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n            }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"license_model\",\r\n        \"max_dimensions\",\r\n        \"title\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Detail Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe **detail_set** query string parameter fields value represents a large batch of metadata fields that are often used to build a detailed view of images. \r\nThe following fields are provided for every image in your result set when you include **detail_set** in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"images\": \r\n    [\r\n        \"allowed_use\",\r\n        \"artist\",\r\n        \"asset_family\",\r\n        \"call_for_image\",\r\n        \"caption\",\r\n        \"collection_code\",\r\n        \"collection_id\",\r\n        \"collection_name\",\r\n        \"copyright\",\r\n        \"date_created\",\r\n        \"display_sizes\": \r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"comp\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n            }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"editorial_segments\",\r\n        \"event_ids\",\r\n        \"graphical_style\",\r\n        \"license_model\",\r\n        \"max_dimensions\",\r\n        \"orientation\",\r\n        \"product_types\",\r\n        \"quality_rank\",\r\n        \"referral_destinations\",\r\n        \"title\"\r\n    ]\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Display Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe **display_set** query string parameter fields value represents the fields that provide you with URLs for the low resolution files that are most \r\nfrequently used to build a UI displaying search results. The following fields are provided for every image in your result set when you include **display_set**\r\nin your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"images\": \r\n    [\r\n        \"display_sizes\": \r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"comp\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Request Usage Considerations\r\n\r\n- Specifying the \"entity_details\" response field can have significant performance implications.

Please see our [Getting Started](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/getting-started.html) \r\npage for more information on how to sign up for an API key. \r\n \r\nYou can show different information in the response by specifying values on the \"fields\" parameter (see details below).\r\nYou can search with only an API key, and that will give you search results that are equivalent to doing a search on the GettyImages.com site without being logged in (anonymous search).

      description: "Use this endpoint to search our editorial stock photos, illustrations and archival images.  Editorial images represent newsworthy events or illustrate matters of general interest, such as news, sport and entertainment and are generally intended for editorial use.\r\n\r\nYou'll need an API key and access token to use this resource. Please see our [Getting Started](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/getting-started.html) \r\npage for more information on how to sign up for an API key.\r\n\r\nYou can show different information in the response by specifying values on the \"fields\" parameter (see details below).\r\nYou can search with only an API key, and that will give you search results that are equivalent to doing a search on the GettyImages.com site without being logged in (anonymous search).  If you are a Getty Images API customer and would like to ensure that your API searches return only assets that you have a license to use, you need to also include an authorization token in the header of your request.  Please consult our [Authorization FAQ](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/authorization-faq.html) for more information on authorization tokens, and our [Authorization Workflows](https://github.com/gettyimages/gettyimages-api/blob/master/OAuth2Workflow.md) for code examples of getting a token.\r\nTo include your API token in the search request, add it to the headers as a Bearer token (example in curl):\r\n\r\n\t-H \"Authorization: Bearer <your-token>\"\r\n\r\n## Working with Fields Sets\r\n\r\nFields sets are used in the **fields** request parameter to receive a suite of metadata fields. The following fields sets are available:\r\n\r\n#### Summary Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe **summary_set** query string parameter fields value represents a small batch of metadata fields that are often used to build search response results. The following fields are provided for every image in your result set when you include **summary_set** in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"images\": \r\n    [\r\n        \"asset_family\",\r\n        \"caption\",\r\n        \"collection_code\",\r\n        \"collection_id\",\r\n        \"collection_name\",\r\n        \"display_sizes\": \r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n            }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"license_model\",\r\n        \"max_dimensions\",\r\n        \"title\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Detail Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe **detail_set** query string parameter fields value represents a large batch of metadata fields that are often used to build a detailed view of images. The following fields are provided for every image in your result set when you include **detail_set** in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"images\": \r\n    [\r\n        \"allowed_use\",\r\n        \"artist\",\r\n        \"asset_family\",\r\n        \"call_for_image\",\r\n        \"caption\",\r\n        \"collection_code\",\r\n        \"collection_id\",\r\n        \"collection_name\",\r\n        \"copyright\",\r\n        \"date_created\",\r\n        \"display_sizes\": \r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"comp\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n            }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"editorial_segments\",\r\n        \"event_ids\",\r\n        \"graphical_style\",\r\n        \"license_model\",\r\n        \"max_dimensions\",\r\n        \"orientation\",\r\n        \"product_types\",\r\n        \"quality_rank\",\r\n        \"referral_destinations\",\r\n        \"title\"\r\n    ]\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Display Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe **display_set** query string parameter fields value represents the fields that provide you with URLs for the low resolution files that are most frequently used to build a UI displaying search results. The following fields are provided for every image in your result set when you include **display_set** in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"images\": \r\n    [\r\n        \"display_sizes\": \r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"comp\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Request Usage Considerations\r\n\r\n- Specifying the \"entity_details\" response field can have significant performance implications. The field should be used only when necessary.\r\n"

The following fields sets are available:\r\n\r\n#### Summary Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe **summary_set** query string parameter fields value represents a small batch of metadata fields that are often used to build search response results. The following fields are provided for every video in your result set when you include **summary_set** in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"videos\":\r\n    [\r\n        \"asset_family\",\r\n        \"caption\",\r\n        \"collection_code\",\r\n        \"collection_name\",\r\n        \"display_sizes\":\r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"comp\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n            }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"license_model\",\r\n        \"title\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Detail Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe **detail_set** query string parameter fields value represents a large batch of metadata fields that are often used to build a detailed view of videos. The following fields are provided for every video in your result set when you include **detail_set** in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"videos\":\r\n    [\r\n        \"allowed_use\",\r\n        \"artist\",\r\n        \"asset_family\",\r\n\t\t\"call_for_image\",\r\n        \"caption\",\r\n        \"clip_length\",\r\n        \"collection_code\",\r\n        \"collection_id\",\r\n        \"collection_name\",\r\n        \"color_type\",\r\n        \"copyright\",\r\n        \"date_created\",\r\n        \"display_sizes\":\r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"comp\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n            }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"era\",\r\n        \"license_model\",\r\n        \"mastered_to\",\r\n        \"originally_shot_on\",\r\n        \"product_types\",\r\n        \"shot_speed\",\r\n        \"source\",\r\n        \"title\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Display Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe **display_set** query string parameter fields value represents the fields that provide you with URLs for the low resolution files that are most frequently used to build a UI displaying search results. The following fields are provided for every video in your result set when you include **display_set** in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"videos\":\r\n    [\r\n        \"display_sizes\":\r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"comp\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Request Usage Considerations\r\n\r\n- Specifying the \"entity_details\" response field can have significant performance implications. The field should be used only when necessary.\r\n"

The following fields are provided for every video in your result set when you include **summary_set** in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"videos\": \r\n    [\r\n        \"asset_family\", \r\n        \"caption\",\r\n        \"collection_code\",\r\n        \"collection_name\",\r\n        \"display_sizes\":\r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"comp\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n            }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"license_model\",\r\n        \"title\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Detail Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe **detail_set** query string parameter fields value represents a large batch of metadata fields that are often used to build a \r\ndetailed view of videos. The following fields are provided for every video in your result set when you include **detail_set** in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"videos\": \r\n    [\r\n        \"allowed_use\",\r\n        \"artist\",\r\n        \"asset_family\", \r\n\t\t\"call_for_image\",\r\n        \"caption\", \r\n        \"clip_length\",\r\n        \"collection_code\",\r\n        \"collection_id\",\r\n        \"collection_name\", \r\n        \"color_type\",\r\n        \"copyright\",\r\n        \"date_created\",\r\n        \"display_sizes\":\r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"comp\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n            }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"era\",\r\n        \"license_model\",\r\n        \"mastered_to\",\r\n        \"originally_shot_on\",\r\n        \"product_types\",\r\n        \"shot_speed\",\r\n        \"source\",\r\n        \"title\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Display Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe **display_set** query string parameter fields value represents the fields that provide you with URLs for the low resolution files \r\nthat are most frequently used to build a UI displaying search results. The following fields are provided for every video in your result \r\nset when you include **display_set** in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"videos\":\r\n    [\r\n        \"display_sizes\":\r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"comp\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```"

        # Report Usage

        Use this endpoint to report the usages of a set of assets. The count of assets submitted in a single batch to this endpoint is limited to 1000. Note that all asset Ids specified must be valid or the operation will fail causing no usages to be recorded. In this case, you will need to remove the invalid asset Ids from the query request and re-submit the query.

        ##  Quickstart

        You'll need an API key and a [Resource Owner Grant](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/authorization-faq.html) access token to use this resource.
        Please see our [Getting Started](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/getting-started.html) page for more information on how to sign up for an API key. 

        _Note_: Date of use can be in any unambiguous date format.

Please see our [Getting Started](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/getting-started.html) page for more information on how to sign up for an API key.\r\n\r\nYou can show different information in the response by specifying values on the \"fields\" parameter (see details below).\r\nYou can search with only an API key, and that will give you search results that are equivalent to doing a search on the GettyImages.com site without being logged in (anonymous search).  If you are a Getty Images API customer and would like to ensure that your API searches return only assets that you have a license to use, you need to also include an authorization token in the header of your request.  Please consult our [Authorization FAQ](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/authorization-faq.html) for more information on authorization tokens, and our [Authorization Workflows](https://github.com/gettyimages/gettyimages-api/blob/master/OAuth2Workflow.md) for code examples of getting a token.\r\n\r\n## Working with Fields Sets\r\n\r\nFields sets are used in the **fields** request parameter to receive a suite of metadata fields. The following fields sets are available:\r\n\r\n#### Summary Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe **summary_set** query string parameter fields value represents a small batch of metadata fields that are often used to build search response results. The following fields are provided for every video in your result set when you include **summary_set** in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"videos\": \r\n    [\r\n        \"asset_family\",\r\n        \"caption\",\r\n        \"collection_code\",\r\n        \"collection_name\",\r\n        \"display_sizes\":\r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"comp\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n            }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"license_model\",\r\n        \"title\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Detail Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe **detail_set** query string parameter fields value represents a large batch of metadata fields that are often used to build a detailed view of videos. The following fields are provided for every video in your result set when you include **detail_set** in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"videos\": \r\n    [\r\n        \"allowed_use\",\r\n        \"artist\",\r\n        \"asset_family\",\r\n\t\t\"call_for_image\",\r\n        \"caption\",\r\n        \"clip_length\",\r\n        \"collection_code\",\r\n        \"collection_id\",\r\n        \"collection_name\",\r\n        \"color_type\",\r\n        \"copyright\",\r\n        \"date_created\",\r\n        \"display_sizes\":\r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"comp\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n            }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"download_sizes\",\r\n        \"era\",\r\n        \"license_model\",\r\n        \"mastered_to\",\r\n        \"originally_shot_on\",\r\n        \"product_types\",\r\n        \"shot_speed\",\r\n        \"source\",\r\n        \"title\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Display Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe **display_set** query string parameter fields value represents the fields that provide you with URLs for the low resolution files that are most frequently used to build a UI displaying search results. The following fields are provided for every video in your result set when you include **display_set** in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"videos\":\r\n    [\r\n        \"display_sizes\": \r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"comp\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Request Usage Considerations\r\n\r\n- Specifying the \"entity_details\" response field can have significant performance implications. The field should be used only when necessary.\r\n"

      description: "Use this endpoint to return detailed video metadata for the specified video id.\r\n\r\nYou'll need an API key and access token to use this resource. Please see our [Getting Started](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/getting-started.html) page for more information on how to sign up for an API key.\r\n\r\nYou can show different information in the response by specifying values on the \"fields\" parameter (see details below).\r\nYou can search with only an API key, and that will give you search results that are equivalent to doing a search on the GettyImages.com site without being logged in (anonymous search).  If you are a Getty Images API customer and would like to ensure that your API searches return only assets that you have a license to use, you need to also include an authorization token in the header of your request.  Please consult our [Authorization FAQ](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/authorization-faq.html) for more information on authorization tokens, and our [Authorization Workflows](https://github.com/gettyimages/gettyimages-api/blob/master/OAuth2Workflow.md) for code examples of getting a token.\r\n\r\n## Working with Fields Sets\r\n\r\nFields sets are used in the **fields** request parameter to receive a suite of metadata fields. The following fields sets are available:\r\n\r\n#### Summary Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe **summary_set** query string parameter fields value represents a small batch of metadata fields that are often used to build search response results. The following fields are provided for every video in your result set when you include **summary_set** in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"videos\":\r\n    [\r\n        \"asset_family\",\r\n        \"caption\",\r\n        \"collection_code\",\r\n        \"collection_name\",\r\n        \"display_sizes\":\r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"comp\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n            }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"license_model\",\r\n        \"title\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Detail Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe **detail_set** query string parameter fields value represents a large batch of metadata fields that are often used to build a detailed view of videos. The following fields are provided for every video in your result set when you include **detail_set** in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"videos\":\r\n    [\r\n        \"allowed_use\",\r\n        \"artist\",\r\n        \"asset_family\",\r\n\t\t\"call_for_image\",\r\n        \"caption\",\r\n        \"clip_length\",\r\n        \"collection_code\",\r\n        \"collection_id\",\r\n        \"collection_name\",\r\n        \"color_type\",\r\n        \"copyright\",\r\n        \"date_created\",\r\n        \"display_sizes\":\r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"comp\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n            }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"download_sizes\",\r\n        \"era\",\r\n        \"license_model\",\r\n        \"mastered_to\",\r\n        \"originally_shot_on\",\r\n        \"product_types\",\r\n        \"shot_speed\",\r\n        \"source\",\r\n        \"title\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Display Fields Set\r\n\r\nThe **display_set** query string parameter fields value represents the fields that provide you with URLs for the low resolution files that are most frequently used to build a UI displaying search results. The following fields are provided for every video in your result set when you include **display_set** in your request.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"videos\":\r\n    [\r\n        \"display_sizes\":\r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"comp\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"preview\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"thumb\"\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Request Usage Considerations\r\n\r\n- Specifying the \"entity_details\" response field can have significant performance implications. The field should be used only when necessary.\r\n"
