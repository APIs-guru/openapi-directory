    Quick start - Telematics SDK

    # Introduction We have prepared a set of APIs for quick start to integrate telematics SDK that powers mobile telematics inside 3rd party mobile applications.  * [CONTACT US](https://telematicssdk.com) * [SANDBOX](https://userdatahub.com) * [DEV.PORTAL](https://docs.telematicssdk.com) * [DEMO APP](https://raxeltelematics.com/telematics-app)   # Overview Datamotion provides telematics infrastructure for mobile applications.   Telematics SDK turns any smartphone into telematics data gathering device to collect Location, driving and behavior data. API services unlocks power of your mobile application  There are 3 groups of methods: * 1 - user management * 2 - statistics for mobile app * 3 - statistics for back-end(s)  in certain cases you will need SNS or any other notification services. read more [here](https://docs.telematicssdk.com/platform-features/sns) # Possible architecture  There are three common schemes that are used by our clients.
