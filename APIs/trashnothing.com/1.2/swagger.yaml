      Provides access to specific public API endpoints which don't require user authorization. <br /><br /> The API currently allows api key access to list, search and retrieve posts (for public posts and posts on open archive groups) and to list, search and retrieve groups. <br /><br /> NOTE: Some API endpoints behave differently when requests are made using api keys instead of oauth (because api key requests have no user associated with them).  Check the documentation for each endpoint for a description of the differences.

      Manage conversations and messages with other users. <br /><br /> It's important to note that messages are always sent by email to the users.   So it's possible to create a fully functional app using the trash nothing API without using any of the conversations or messages API endpoints.  These API endpoints are useful for developers who want to build a complete messaging interface into their app.

  /posts/client.js:
    get:
      description: >
        Defines javascript functions that can be used to validate and submit posts.


        The advantage of using these functions versus using the post submission endpoint directly is that

        some of the post validation checks can be done on the client side which will be faster.


        NOTE: If used, this javascript file MUST be loaded dynamically for each user because the contents

        of the file are generated dynamically based on the current user.  The file may be cached on a per

        user basis based on the HTTP cache headers that are returned when the file is requested (currently

        the cache headers specify that the file should expire after one day).



        The following functions are available:


        ---


        **window.TN.check_crossposting_restrictions(group_ids)**


        Checks for crossposting restrictions when the user selects more than one group to post to.


        Parameters:

        - **group_ids** is an array of group IDs


        Returns an object with three properties {allowed, restricted, restrictions}.


        - **allowed** is an array of the group IDs from group_ids that can be crossposted to


        - **restricted** is an array of the group IDs from group_ids that can't be crossposted to


        - **restrictions** is an object mapping group IDs that have crossposting restrictions to arrays of group IDs that are restricted.
          It is useful for pinpointing why a group ID shows up in the restricted array so that users can be provided feedback
          about the reason for the crossposting restriction (eg. a message like 'group A doesn't allow crossposting to group B').

        For example, given group_ids = [1, 2, 3, 4] and assuming group 1 doesn't allow posting to group 3 and group 2 doesn't allow

        posting to group 1, the returned object will be:


        {allowed: [4], restricted: [1, 2, 3], restrictions: {1: [3], 2: [1]}}



        ---


        **window.TN.submit_post(args, session, preferences, callback)**


        Submits a new post and performs validation checks on the post before it is accepted for submission.


        Parameters:


        - **args** is an object containing data about the post being submitted and must include
          the following properties:

          - type: The type of post.  One of: offer, wanted
          - title: A short description of the item(s).
          - location: A short location description.

          The following properties are optional:

          - content: A longer description of the item(s).
          - group_ids: An array of group IDs to submit the post to (if any).
          - fair_offer: If set to 1, the post will be posted with the Fair Offer Policy (only valid for offer posts - see https://trashnothing.com/fair_offer_policy ).
          - photo_ids: A comma separated list of the IDs of the photos that should be attached to this post.
          - latitude
          - longitude

        - **session** is a temporary object that is used by submit_post to store data about the submission
          process for a single post.  The first time submit_post is called with a post, session should
          be a new empty object (eg. {}).  The session object should be persisted until that post
          is successfully submitted and then it can be discarded so that the next post will start
          over with a new empty session object.  

        - **preferences** is a permanent object that the client persists and modifies based on warnings returned
          by the post submission process and user input.  Some post warnings passed to the callback object
          have a preference_key string property so that users can opt out of those warnings in the future.
          To save this opt-out preference, set the property indicated by the preference_key in the preferences
          object (eg. preferences[preference_key] = 1).  The preferences object is only read by submit_post and
          never modified - it is up to the client to initialize, modify and persist the preferences object.

        - **callback** is a function used to return the result of the post submission. It is called and passed
          one argument - an object with five properties {result, message, preference_key, identifier, session}.
          The result property is a string that is one of: success, error, warning.  The identifier property is
          set for errors and warnings and will contain a string that represents the type of error or warning that
          occurred.

          A success result indicates that the post was submitted successfully. Note that posts may not
          appear instantly after submission because the moderators of many groups may have additional
          automatic or manual review processes in place that can delay the publishing of a post.
          
          An error result indicates that there is an error with the post to show the user and the message property
          will contain text describing the error.

          A warning result indicates that there is a warning about the post to show the user and the
          message property will contain a string describing the warning.  A warning result doesn't prevent a post from
          being submitted, to continue the submission process after a warning result, just re-submit the post
          (with the updated session object) to temporarily override that specific warning.

          Certain types of warnings can be opted out of.  These warnings will set preference_key to a string that can be 
          set in the preferences object by the client to opt out of that type of warning in the future (see the description
          of the preferences parameter for more details).

          Because many messages are received by email, all messages have a subject. The subject is often useful to allow the recipient to determine which post a message may be referring to.  In rare cases, some senders send emails with a subject and but no email body which causes the message content to be an empty string.

              If the current user can leave positive or negative feedback on this user then restriction is null. <br /><br /> Otherwise, restriction is set to a string that explains why feedback is currently restricted and what type of feedback is restricted. The string will be one of the following:  no-recent-messages, negative-score, moderator, [days]-day-wait-for-negative <br /><br /> - **no-recent-messages**: The current user has not received any messages from this user in the last 30 days. <br /> - **negative-score**: The current user has a negative feedback and will not be able to leave feedback until their score is >= 0. <br /> - **moderator**: The user is a moderator and leaving feedback on moderators is not currently supported. <br /> - **[days]-day-wait-for-negative**: Positive feedback is not restricted but the current user must wait
                some number of days before they will be able to leave negative feedback on this user.  This string can 
                change depending on the number of days.  For example, when the current user must wait one day, the
                string will be '1-day-wait-for-negative'.  A wait is necessary because a lot of negative feedback results
