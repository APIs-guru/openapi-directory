    flexible API provides many options for availability and booking.\r

    <br><br>\r

    Take the API for a test drive. Just click on the Authorize button below
    and authenticate. \r

    You can access our demo company profile if you are not a customer, or
    your own profile by using your assigned ClientId and Secret.\r

    <br><br>\r

    The API has two interfaces, consumer and setup. \r

    <ul>\r

    <li>\r

    The consumer interface provides all the endpoints required for
    implementing consumer booking flows.\r

    </li>\r

    <li>\r

    The setup interface provides endpoints for profile configuration and
    setup.\r

    </li>\r

    </ul>\r

    Toggle freely between the two interfaces using the swagger tool bar
    option labelled 'Select a definition'.\r\n"

        An appointment is reserved but may not be completed as a booking
