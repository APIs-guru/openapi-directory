    Our flexible API provides many options for configuration.\r

    <br><br>\r

    Take the API for a test drive. Just click on the Authorize button below
    and authenticate. \r

    You can access our demo company profile if you are not a customer, or
    your own profile by using your assigned ClientId and Secret.\r

    <br><br>\r

    The API has two interfaces, consumer and setup. \r

    <ul>\r

    <li>\r

    The consumer interface provides all the endpoints required for
    implementing consumer booking flows.\r

    </li>\r

    <li>\r

    The setup interface provides endpoints for profile configuration and
    setup.\r

    </li>\r

    </ul>\r

    Toggle freely between the two interfaces using the swagger tool bar
    option labelled 'Select a definition'.\r\n"

        EndDateTime.\r

        A reason for the block is also required. This reason will
        display in the OnSched Portal Calendar.\r

        \r

        Calendar blocks can be set to specific time ranges or for the
        whole day. \r

        \r

        Calendar blocks can be for a specific date range instance or set
        to repeat at a specified frequency.\r

        The frequency can be set to a value of D,W,M,Y for Day, Week,
        Month, or Year respecitively. \r

        \r

        Daily blocks will repeat for each day of the week for the date
        range specified.\r

        \r

        Weekly blocks will repeat only on the specified days of the week
        for the date range specified. For a weekly block\r

        you must also specify the weekdays. Weekdays are expressed as a
        string of digits with each single digit in the string representing a
        day\r

        of the week. The possible values are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 where
        0=Sunday, 1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, 3=Wed, 4=Thursday, 5=Friday,
        6=Saturday.\r

        For example a repeat weekly entry with weekdays 24 repeats each
        week on Tuesday and Thursday.\r

        \r

        Use the interval property to specify the interval that the block
        repeats. For example an interval of 2 for a weekly block means that\r

        the block will repeat every second week beginning at the day
        specified. A daily block with an interval of 10 means the block will\r

        repeat every 10 days. The interval property applies to all
        repeat frequencies.\r

        \r

        Monthly blocks repeat either on the day of the month specified
        in the month day property or on the day of the week and week of the
        month specified by\r

        the start date. For example, repeat every 3rd friday of each
        month, repeat on the 21st day of the month.\r

        \r

        Repeat blocks will end on the date specified by the end date.
        You can specify never in the EndDateTime field to indicate the repeating
        block\r

        \r

        Service allocations are used primarily for event type services.
        The allocation represents an occurrence of an allocation.\r

        \r

        Service allocations can be set to specific time ranges or for
        the whole day. Use the AllDay setting to create an all day block.\r

        \r

        Service allocations can be for a specific date range instance or
        set to repeat at a specified frequency.\r

        The frequency can be set to a value of D,W,M,Y for Day, Week,
        Month, or Year respecitively. \r

        \r

        Daily allocations will repeat for each day of the week for the
        date range specified.\r

        \r

        Weekly allocations will repeat only on the specified days of the
        week for the date range specified. For a weekly block\r

        you must also specify the weekdays. Weekdays are expressed as a
        string of digits with each single digit in the string representing a
        day\r

        of the week. The possible values are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 where
        0=Sunday, 1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, 3=Wed, 4=Thursday, 5=Friday,
        6=Saturday.\r

        For example a repeat weekly entry with weekdays 24 repeats each
        week on Tuesday and Thursday.\r

        \r

        Use the interval property to specify the interval that the
        allocation repeats. For example an interval of 2 for a weekly block
        means that\r

        the block will repeat every second week beginning at the day
        specified. A daily block with an interval of 10 means the block will\r

        repeat every 10 days. The interval property applies to all
        repeat frequencies.\r

        \r

        Monthly allocations repeat either on the day of the month
        specified in the month day property or on the day of the week and week
        of the month specified by\r

        the start date. For example, repeat every 3rd friday of each
        month, repeat on the 21st day of the month.\r

        \r

        Repeat allocations will end on the date specified by the end
