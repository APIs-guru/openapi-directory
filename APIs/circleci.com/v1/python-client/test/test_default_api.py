    CircleCI REST API

    The CircleCI API is a RESTful, fully-featured API that allows you to do almost anything in CircleCI. You can access all information and trigger all actions. The only thing we donâ€™t provide access to is billing functions, which must be done from the CircleCI web UI. 

    The version of the OpenAPI document: v1
    Generated by OpenAPI Generator (https://openapi-generator.tech)
