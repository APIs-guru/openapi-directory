                    A string that describes the columns (width) and rows (height) of the generated composed video in pixels. Defaults to `640x480`. 
                    The string's format is `{width}x{height}` where: 

                    * 16 <= `{width}` <= 1280

                    * `{width}` * `{height}` <= 921,600

                    Typical values are: 

                    * HD = `1280x720`
                    * PAL = `1024x576`

                    Note that the `resolution` imposes an aspect ratio to the resulting composition. When the original video tracks are constrained by the aspect ratio, they are scaled to fit.
