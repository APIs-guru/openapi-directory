    MetaPub collects, normalizes and distributes publicly available program, episode, and piece metadata through the public radio system. Backed by ContentDepot and its data model, MetaPub allows producers to supply metadata through various methods:


    1. MetaPub Agents that collect producer metadata by "crawling" existing public feeds (e.g. C24, BBC) or the producer's production system (e.g. ATC, ME, TED Radio Hour).

    2. Manually enter metadata in the ContentDepot Portal on each program and episode.

    3. Publish/push the metadata to the MetaPub upload API and execute an ingest job.


    MetaPub then distributes this data to stations through an electronic program guide (EPG model)

    for display on various listener devices such as smart phones, tablets, web streams, HD radios, RDBS enabled FM radios, and more. The EPG format is based on the [RadioDNS specifications](https://radiodns.org/developers/documentation/).


    ## RadioDNS and MetaPub


    The RadioDNS Service and Programme Information Specification ([TS 102 818 v3.1.1](http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102800_102899/102818/03.01.01_60/ts_102818v030101p.pdf)) defines three primary documents: Service Information, Program Information, and Group Information. These documents, along with the core RadioDNS Hybrid Lookup for Radio Services Specification ([TS 103 270 v1.2.1](http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts%5C103200_103299%5C103270%5C01.02.01_60%5Cts_103270v010201p.pdf)) define a system where an end listener device can dynamically discover program metadata and fetch the metadata via Internet Protocol (IP) requests. MetaPub's use of RadioDNS differs slightly in that MetaPub (a.k.a PRSS) acts as the "service provider" while the stations and related middleware act as the end devices. While this is not the primary use case of RadioDNS, the flexibility in the specification, service definitions, and DNS resolution allows this model to be easily represented.


    This documentation gives a high level overview of how the RadioDNS specifications will be used by MetaPub, however it is strongly recommended that the related RadioDNS specifications be read for implementation details, definitions, and required XML schemas.


    ## ContentDepot Drive


    ContentDepot Drive (CD Drive) provides a private, per customer file storage solution similar to other cloud storage solutions such as Google Drive, Box, and Dropbox. The CD Drive is used to stage content uploads such as metadata files, images, or segment audio before associating the content with specific programs or episodes.


    CD Drive content can be referenced using a URI by some operations such as synchronizing metadata. There are two possible CD Drive URI formats supported: ID and hierarchical path. The ID reference takes the form ```cddrive:id:{value}``` where value is the integer ID of the file or folder being referenced. The hierarchical path reference takes the form ```cddrive://{path}``` where path is the full, UNIX style path to the file or folder starting with '/'. For example, two CD Drive URIs pointing to the same file may be ```cddrive:id:12345``` and ```cddrive:///show1/episode2/metadata.xml```. More information about URIs can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier).


    ## Authentication


    The API currently uses OAuth 2.0.  Some operations require specific scopes to limit clients while the ContentDepot backend may also enforce existing user specific permissions.

Note that an EPG program maps to the ContentDepot concept of an episode which is also known as a "program instance".


        A batch operation must be explicitly created rather than the server attempting to detect new metadata in order to allow for all the content to be uploaded including any supporting content like images.

        The group information (GI) document allows programs to be put into groups such as serials, series, shows, or general themes and provide additional metadata for that group such as a description, links, and a logo. A program in the guide can be linked to its group using the "memberOf" field to allow clients to easily link programs together for a given Content Depot Program/Show in the EPG. GI will be published for all Content Depot programs that have the "publish metadata" option enabled. By using the group information, clients have the ability to access a single list of all metadata supported program titles, links, images, and descriptions. This information can be used to assist a station when setting up a schedule or it can be used in the end user metadata to provide additional information about the content such as displaying "other episodes from this program" or displaying the group, program, and program event images.


        Currently all programs with "publish metadata" enabled will be included in the group information even if they are not active in the program guide. This may change in the future if the number of programs grows.


        Note that while the location of the GI document isn't expected to change change in the near future, as per the RadioDNS specification the authoritative link to the document is defined in the SI document with the mime value ```application/xml+gi```.

        The service information (SI) document holds a definition of services provided by the service provider (e.g. MetaPub), including any relevant metadata and bearer details, such as:


        * Names

        * Descriptions

        * Logos

        * Bearers (broadcast and IP)


        MetaPub will define an SI document that lists the distribution services provided by PRSS including basic service metadata, logos, and bearers. The current design calls for two IP based bearers to be defined:


        * Streams
            * Bearer ID: prss:streams
            * Service ID: streams
        * Files
            * Bearer ID: prss:files
            * Service ID: files

        It is possible that more than two services will be defined in the future depending on the content size per service and middleware use cases, however the RadioDNS specification supports the introduction and removal of services dynamically as needed.


        Based on the RadioDNS specification (section 10.2.4), the SI document will be placed in a defined location on the service website. Using standard HTTP cache mechanisms, the SI document will only need to be fetched and process occasionally.

        The program information (PI) document holds the linear and the on-demand schedule of programs for a service over a 24 hour period. This information provides an electronic program guide (EPG) to clients that defines the program metadata such as:


        *   Names

        *   Descriptions

        *   Logos

        *   Links

        *   Genres

        *   Program Events (a.k.a. pieces)


        Using the two services defined in the SI document, streams and files, MetaPub will produce two PI files daily, one for each service. Construction of the PI URL is detailed later in this document as well as the RadioDNS specification. Note that while the number of services defined isn't expected to change in the near future, as per the RadioDNS specification the authoritative list of services is defined in the SI document.


        Each file will contain 24 hours of program guide information. The current day, the previous day, and the next day will contain detailed program event information (a.k.a. Content Depot pieces) while PI files outside of this range will only contain the program (a.k.a Content Depot episode) level information. This may change in the future with the use of an API key as defined by the RadioDNS specification to identify "trusted" clients. If metadata for any program in the guide(s) changes, the PI document will be regenerated. Using standard HTTP cache mechanisms, the PI document for the current day can be fetch frequently (e.g. every 5 minutes) to receive last minute changes while future and past days will only be fetched and processed occasionally (e.g. every two hours).


        By obtaining the full 24 hour guide, clients such as middleware can build a local database/lookup table of program and program event information that allows for more specific program selection based on user configuration, automation events, and other possible inputs. In the event that MetaPub is unreachable for a short period of time, the client has the full guide to prevent any interruption to the on-air broadcast.


        The EPG contains two types of programming, live and on-demand (a.k.a files). A "live with subsequent file (LWSF)" program may appear in both the streams and files services EPG data because it will both a live stream and an on-demand file. File programs with multi-day air windows will appear in the PI file on every day that the air window is open. That is, the EPG data for each day contains the information about programming available that day, even if the programming is also available on other days. The program ID can be used to resolve these duplicates down to a single instance when processing multiple services or multiple days of EPG data.
