        <p>Using the term parameter and given the start of any word in an airport's official name, a city name, or the start of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Air_Transport_Association_airport_code">IATA code</a>, this API provides the full name and IATA location code of the city or airport, for use in flight searches. Only major cities and civilian airports with several commercial flights per week are included by default. The response provides up to 20 possible matches, sorted by importance, in a <a href="http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/">JQuery UI Autocomplete</a> compatible format. <a href="https://github.com/amadeus-travel-innovation-sandbox/sandbox-content/blob/master/airport-autocomplete-template.html">This sample implementation</a> using JQuery UI may help. This API uses data from the <a href="https://github.com/opentraveldata/opentraveldata/blob/master/opentraveldata/optd_por_public.csv">OpenTravelData</a> project.
        </p> 
        <p>By only using the country parameter, this API is also able to find all the IATA location codes associated with a country. Both term and country parameters can be used together to filter the results accordingly.          
        </p>
        <p>The value returned is the IATA location code. The label returned is always in UTF-8 format, with the airport official name (which is often in the native language), in the format of English City Name (if not already included in the airport name).</p>

    get:
      description: |
        <p>This service gives the most relevant airports in a radius of 500 km around the given coordinates. The relevance of an airport is computed by dividing the number of airport movements (take offs and landings) by the distance from the point. This causes the relevance of an airport to increase exponentially as you approach it.</p>

        <p>To minimize response time, all distances are computed as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance">great-circle distance</a> from the provided coordinates to the airport coordinates, and thus do not take into account traffic conditions, international boundaries, mountains, water, or other elements that might make the a nearby airport hard to reach.</p>

        <p>Only civilian airports with at least several commercial flights per week are included in the results.</p>

        <p>The result is a list of airports sorted by decreasing relevance. It always contains the nearest airport with significant commercial traffic. You can freely download the <a href="https://github.com/opentraveldata/opentraveldata/blob/master/opentraveldata/optd_por_public.csv">point of reference information</a> used by this API from the <a href="https://github.com/opentraveldata/opentraveldata">Open Travel Data</a> project.</p>

        <p>The Extensive Flight Search allows you to find the prices of one-way or return flights between two airports over a large number of dates, and for a large variety of stay durations. The search doesn't return exact itineraries, but rather tells you the best price for a flight on a given day, for a stay of a given duration.</p>

        <p>The search is based on our Extreme Search platform, which continually caches a large number of flight search results from a list of origin cities to a variety of destinations. Since it's a cached search, the response time is fast, but not all origin airports are available. Here is <a href="https://github.com/amadeus-travel-innovation-sandbox/sandbox-content/blob/master/flight-search-cache-origin-destination.csv">a list of the currently supported origin-destination IATA location pairs</a>. We try to keep this list as fresh as possible for you, but be aware that it may not always be exactly up-to-date and it can change without warning.</p>

        <p>That said, a price graph like this provides a powerful bargin shopping tool - allowing travelers with flexible itineraries to identify days on which they can get the cheapest flights to their destinations.</p>

        Amadeus has partnered with <a href="http://yapq.io/">YapQ</a> to bring you point of interest APIs with the goal of offering you unbiased ratings of landmarks and tourist attractions. YapQ rates these points according to their interest on social media and provides Wikipedia content and Geonames ID in a given city. <br />
        YapQ's service indexes millions of points around the world, and provides content in 12 different languages. This allows you to ensure you catch the <em>must-see</em> sights in a <a href="http://yapq.io/cities.html">YapQ supported city</a>.<br />
        Each point of interest comes with links to content, grading information, location and directions to help make discovering your destination easy and fun.<br /><br />
        This service is still under active development, and the response format may change without warning. We'd be interested in your feedback - <a href="mailto:sandbox@yapq.com">send us an email</a>.
