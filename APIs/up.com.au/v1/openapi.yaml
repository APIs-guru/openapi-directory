    The Up API gives you programmatic access to your balances and

    transaction data. You can request past transactions or set up

    webhooks to receive real-time events when new transactions hit your

    account. It’s new, it’s exciting and it’s just the beginning.

      Accounts represent the underlying store used to track balances

      and the transactions that have occurred to modify those balances

      over time. Up currently has two types of account: `SAVER`—used to

      earn interest and to hit savings goals, and `TRANSACTIONAL`—used

      for everyday spending.

      Categories enable understanding where your money goes by driving

      powerful insights in Up. All categories in Up are pre-defined

      and are automatically assigned to new purchases in most cases. A

      parent-child relationship is used to represent categories,

      however parent categories cannot be directly assigned to

      transactions.
    name: Categories

      Tags are custom labels that can be associated with transactions

      on Up. Within the Up application, tags provide additional insight

      into spending. For example, you could have a "Take Away" tag that

      you apply to purchases from food delivery services. The Up API

      allows you to manage the tags associated with transactions. Each

      transaction may have up to 6 tags.


      Tags are identified by their labels, which are unique strings,

      so the tag "Holiday" has also the `id` `"Holiday"`.

      Transactions represent the movement of money into and out of an

      account. They have many characteristics that vary depending on

      the kind of transaction. Transactions may be temporarily `HELD`

      (pending) or `SETTLED`, typically depending on which payment

      method was used at the point of sale.

      Some endpoints exist not to expose data, but to test the API

      itself. Currently there is only one endpoint in this group: ping!
    name: Utility endpoints
  - description: >
      Webhooks provide a mechanism for a configured URL to receive

      events when transaction activity occurs on Up. You can think of

      webhooks as being like push notifications for your server-side

      application.

                Once you have created a webhook in the Up API, events are sent to the

                webhook’s configured URL as JSON-encoded `POST` requests. The webhook

                URL must respond with a HTTP `200` status on success.


                It is important that the URL responds in a timely manner. If the URL

                takes too long to respond (currently 30s), the request will be timed

                out. For this reason it is strongly advised to avoid any heavy

                processing before a response has been returned from the URL. A common

                solution to this problem is to use a message broker such as RabbitMQ

                to do the work asynchronously.


                Event delivery is retried with exponential backoff in the case of any

                non-`200` response status, if the URL is unreachable, or if the request

                is timed out.


                Refer to the `eventType` attribute in order to determine what course of

                action to take when handling the event. The following event types are

                currently sent:


                **`PING`**


                Manually triggered by calls to the webhook `ping` endpoint. Used for

                testing and debugging purposes.


                **`TRANSACTION_CREATED`**


                Triggered whenever a new transaction is created in Up. This event

                includes a `transaction` relationship that provides the unique

                identifier for the transaction and a link to the transaction within the

                Up API. This link should be used to retrieve the complete transaction

                data.


                **`TRANSACTION_SETTLED`**


                Triggered whenever a transaction transitions from the `HELD` status to

                the `SETTLED` status. This event includes a `transaction` relationship

                that provides the unique identifier for the transaction and a link to

                the transaction within the Up API. This link should be used to retrieve

                the complete transaction data.


                Due to external factors in banking processes, on rare occasions this

                event may not be triggered. Separate `TRANSACTION_DELETED` and

                `TRANSACTION_CREATED` events will be received in its place.


                **`TRANSACTION_DELETED`**


                Triggered whenever a `HELD` transaction is deleted from Up. This

                generally occurs for example when a hotel deposit is returned. This

                event includes a `transaction` relationship that provides the unique

                identifier for the transaction, however no link is provided to the

                transaction within the Up API as it no longer exists.


                ## Securing Webhook Event Handlers


                Incoming webhook event requests include a `X-Up-Authenticity-Signature`

                header, which can be used to verify that the event was sent by Up.

                Verification of the signature requires knowledge of the shared

                `secretKey` that was returned upon creation of the webhook. This key is

                known only to your application and to Up.


                The verification process involves:


                1. Taking the raw, unparsed webhook event request body.

                2. Computing the SHA-256 HMAC signature of the request body, using the
                   shared `secretKey`.
                3. Comparing the computed HMAC signature with the value of the
                   `X-Up-Authenticity-Signature` header.

                If the computed SHA-256 HMAC signature matches the

                `X-Up-Authenticity-Signature` header, the request is valid.


                A few language-specific examples follow.


                **Ruby**:


                This example uses the Ruby on Rails framework.


                ```ruby

                require 'openssl'


                def handle_webhook_event
                  received_signature =
                    request.headers['X-Up-Authenticity-Signature']

                  signature = OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(
                    'SHA256',
                    secret_key,
                    request.raw_post,
                  )

                  if Rack::Utils.secure_compare(received_signature, signature)
                    # Process webhook event
                  end
                end

                ```


                **PHP**:


                This example uses the Laravel framework.


                ```php

                public function handleWebhookEvent(Request $request) {
                    $received_signature = $request->header(
                        'X-Up-Authenticity-Signature',
                        ''
                    );
                    $raw_body = $request->getContent();
                    $signature = hash_hmac('sha256', $raw_body, $this->secretKey);

                    if (hash_equals($signature, $received_signature)) {
                        // Process webhook event
                    }
                }

                ```


                **Go**:


                This example is in plain Go.


                ```go

                import (
                    "crypto/hmac"
                    "crypto/sha256"
                    "encoding/hex"
                    "io"
                    "net/http"
                )


                func handleWebhookEvent(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
                    receivedSignature, _ := hex.DecodeString(
                        r.Header.Get("X-Up-Authenticity-Signature"),
                    )

                    mac := hmac.New(sha256.New, secretKey)
                    io.Copy(mac, r.Body)
                    signature := mac.Sum(nil)

                    if hmac.Equal(signature, receivedSignature)
                        // Process webhook event
                    }
                }

                ```


                If the `secretKey` for a webhook is lost, simply create a new webhook

                with the same URL, capture the returned `secretKey` and delete the

                original webhook.

      description: >
        Create a new webhook with a given URL. The URL will receive webhook

        events as JSON-encoded `POST` requests. The URL must respond with a HTTP

        `200` status on success.


        There is currently a limit of 10 webhooks at any given time. Once this

        limit is reached, existing webhooks will need to be deleted before new

        webhooks can be created.


        Event delivery is retried with exponential backoff if the URL is

        unreachable or it does not respond with a `200` status. The response

        includes a `secretKey` attribute, which is used to sign requests sent to

        the webhook URL. It will not be returned from any other endpoints within

        the Up API. If the `secretKey` is lost, simply create a new webhook with

        the same URL, capture its `secretKey` and then delete the original

        webhook. See [Handling webhook events](#callback_post_webhookURL) for

        details on how to process webhook events.


        It is probably a good idea to test the webhook by

        [sending it a `PING` event](#post_webhooks_webhookId_ping) after creating

        it.
