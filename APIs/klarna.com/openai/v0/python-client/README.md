from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://www.klarna.com/us/shopping
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://www.klarna.com/us/shopping"
)



# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.OpenAiProductEndpointApi(api_client)
    q = 'q_example' # str | A precise query that matches one very small category or product that needs to be searched for to find the products the user is looking for. If the user explicitly stated what they want, use that as a query. The query is as specific as possible to the product name or category mentioned by the user in its singular form, and don't contain any clarifiers like latest, newest, cheapest, budget, premium, expensive or similar. The query is always taken from the latest topic, if there is a new topic a new query is started.
    size = 56 # int | number of products returned (optional)
    budget = 56 # int | maximum price of the matching product in local currency, filters results (optional)

    try:
        # API for fetching Klarna product information
        api_response = api_instance.products_using_get(q, size=size, budget=budget)
        print("The response of OpenAiProductEndpointApi->products_using_get:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling OpenAiProductEndpointApi->products_using_get: %s\n" % e)
