    # Introduction


    The DigitalOcean API allows you to manage Droplets and resources within the

    DigitalOcean cloud in a simple, programmatic way using conventional HTTP requests.


    All of the functionality that you are familiar with in the DigitalOcean

    control panel is also available through the API, allowing you to script the

    complex actions that your situation requires.


    The API documentation will start with a general overview about the design

    and technology that has been implemented, followed by reference information

    about specific endpoints.


    ## Requests


    Any tool that is fluent in HTTP can communicate with the API simply by

    requesting the correct URI. Requests should be made using the HTTPS protocol

    so that traffic is encrypted. The interface responds to different methods

    depending on the action required.


    |Method|Usage|

    |--- |--- |

    |GET|For simple retrieval of information about your account, Droplets, or environment, you should use the GET method.  The information you request will be returned to you as a JSON object. The attributes defined by the JSON object can be used to form additional requests.  Any request using the GET method is read-only and will not affect any of the objects you are querying.|

    |DELETE|To destroy a resource and remove it from your account and environment, the DELETE method should be used.  This will remove the specified object if it is found.  If it is not found, the operation will return a response indicating that the object was not found. This idempotency means that you do not have to check for a resource's availability prior to issuing a delete command, the final state will be the same regardless of its existence.|

    |PUT|To update the information about a resource in your account, the PUT method is available. Like the DELETE Method, the PUT method is idempotent.  It sets the state of the target using the provided values, regardless of their current values. Requests using the PUT method do not need to check the current attributes of the object.|

    |PATCH|Some resources support partial modification. In these cases, the PATCH method is available. Unlike PUT which generally requires a complete representation of a resource, a PATCH request is is a set of instructions on how to modify a resource updating only specific attributes.|

    |POST|To create a new object, your request should specify the POST method. The POST request includes all of the attributes necessary to create a new object.  When you wish to create a new object, send a POST request to the target endpoint.|

    |HEAD|Finally, to retrieve metadata information, you should use the HEAD method to get the headers.  This returns only the header of what would be returned with an associated GET request. Response headers contain some useful information about your API access and the results that are available for your request. For instance, the headers contain your current rate-limit value and the amount of time available until the limit resets. It also contains metrics about the total number of objects found, pagination information, and the total content length.|



    ## HTTP Statuses


    Along with the HTTP methods that the API responds to, it will also return

    standard HTTP statuses, including error codes.


    In the event of a problem, the status will contain the error code, while the

    body of the response will usually contain additional information about the

    problem that was encountered.


    In general, if the status returned is in the 200 range, it indicates that

    the request was fulfilled successfully and that no error was encountered.


    Return codes in the 400 range typically indicate that there was an issue

    with the request that was sent. Among other things, this could mean that you

    did not authenticate correctly, that you are requesting an action that you

    do not have authorization for, that the object you are requesting does not

    exist, or that your request is malformed.


    If you receive a status in the 500 range, this generally indicates a

    server-side problem. This means that we are having an issue on our end and

    cannot fulfill your request currently.


    400 and 500 level error responses will include a JSON object in their body,

    including the following attributes:


    |Name|Type|Description|

    |--- |--- |--- |

    |id|string|A short identifier corresponding to the HTTP status code returned. For example, the ID for a response returning a 404 status code would be "not_found."|

    |message|string|A message providing additional information about the error, including details to help resolve it when possible.|

    |request_id|string|Optionally, some endpoints may include a request ID that should be provided when reporting bugs or opening support tickets to help identify the issue.|


    ### Example Error Response


    ```
        HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
        {
          "id":       "forbidden",
          "message":  "You do not have access for the attempted action."
        }
    ```


    ## Responses


    When a request is successful, a response body will typically be sent back in

    the form of a JSON object. An exception to this is when a DELETE request is

    processed, which will result in a successful HTTP 204 status and an empty

    response body.


    Inside of this JSON object, the resource root that was the target of the

    request will be set as the key. This will be the singular form of the word

    if the request operated on a single object, and the plural form of the word

    if a collection was processed.


    For example, if you send a GET request to `/v2/droplets/$DROPLET_ID` you

    will get back an object with a key called "`droplet`". However, if you send

    the GET request to the general collection at `/v2/droplets`, you will get

    back an object with a key called "`droplets`".


    The value of these keys will generally be a JSON object for a request on a

    single object and an array of objects for a request on a collection of

    objects.


    ### Response for a Single Object


    ```
        {
            "droplet": {
                "name": "example.com"
                . . .
            }
        }
    ```


    ### Response for an Object Collection


    ```
        {
            "droplets": [
                {
                    "name": "example.com"
                    . . .
                },
                {
                    "name": "second.com"
                    . . .
                }
            ]
        }
    ```


    ## Meta


    In addition to the main resource root, the response may also contain a

    `meta` object. This object contains information about the response itself.


    The `meta` object contains a `total` key that is set to the total number of

    objects returned by the request. This has implications on the `links` object

    and pagination.


    The `meta` object will only be displayed when it has a value. Currently, the

    `meta` object will have a value when a request is made on a collection (like

    `droplets` or `domains`).



    ### Sample Meta Object


    ```
        {
            . . .
            "meta": {
                "total": 43
            }
            . . .
        }
    ```


    ## Links & Pagination


    The `links` object is returned as part of the response body when pagination

    is enabled. By default, 20 objects are returned per page. If the response

    contains 20 objects or fewer, no `links` object will be returned. If the

    response contains more than 20 objects, the first 20 will be returned along

    with the `links` object.


    You can request a different pagination limit or force pagination by

    appending `?per_page=` to the request with the number of items you would

    like per page. For instance, to show only two results per page, you could

    add `?per_page=2` to the end of your query. The maximum number of results

    per page is 200.


    The `links` object contains a `pages` object. The `pages` object, in turn,

    contains keys indicating the relationship of additional pages. The values of

    these are the URLs of the associated pages. The keys will be one of the

    following:


    *   **first**: The URI of the first page of results.

    *   **prev**: The URI of the previous sequential page of results.

    *   **next**: The URI of the next sequential page of results.

    *   **last**: The URI of the last page of results.


    The `pages` object will only include the links that make sense. So for the

    first page of results, no `first` or `prev` links will ever be set. This

    convention holds true in other situations where a link would not make sense.


    ### Sample Links Object


    ```
        {
            . . .
            "links": {
                "pages": {
                    "last": "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/images?page=2",
                    "next": "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/images?page=2"
                }
            }
            . . .
        }
    ```


    ## Rate Limit


    Requests through the API are rate limited per OAuth token. Current rate limits:


    *   5,000 requests per hour

    *   250 requests per minute (5% of the hourly total)


    Once you exceed either limit, you will be rate limited until the next cycle

    starts. Space out any requests that you would otherwise issue in bursts for

    the best results.


    The rate limiting information is contained within the response headers of

    each request. The relevant headers are:


    *   **RateLimit-Limit**: The number of requests that can be made per hour.

    *   **RateLimit-Remaining**: The number of requests that remain before you hit your request limit. See the information below for how the request limits expire.

    *   **RateLimit-Reset**: This represents the time when the oldest request will expire. The value is given in [Unix epoch time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). See below for more information about how request limits expire.


    As long as the `RateLimit-Remaining` count is above zero, you will be able

    to make additional requests.


    The way that a request expires and is removed from the current limit count

    is important to understand. Rather than counting all of the requests for an

    hour and resetting the `RateLimit-Remaining` value at the end of the hour,

    each request instead has its own timer.


    This means that each request contributes toward the `RateLimit-Remaining`

    count for one complete hour after the request is made. When that request's

    timer runs out, it is no longer counted towards the request limit.


    This has implications on the meaning of the `RateLimit-Reset` header as

    well. Because the entire rate limit is not reset at one time, the value of

    this header is set to the time when the _oldest_ request will expire.


    Keep this in mind if you see your `RateLimit-Reset` value change, but not

    move an entire hour into the future.


    If the `RateLimit-Remaining` reaches zero, subsequent requests will receive

    a 429 error code until the request reset has been reached. You can see the

    format of the response in the examples.


    **Note:** The following endpoints have special rate limit requirements that

    are independent of the limits defined above.


    *   Only 12 `POST` requests to the `/v2/floating_ips` endpoint to create Floating IPs can be made per 60 seconds.

    *   Only 10 `GET` requests to the `/v2/account/keys` endpoint to list SSH keys can be made per 60 seconds.


    ### Sample Rate Limit Headers


    ```
        . . .
        RateLimit-Limit: 1200
        RateLimit-Remaining: 1193
        RateLimit-Reset: 1402425459
        . . .
    ```


    ### Sample Rate Exceeded Response


    ```
        429 Too Many Requests
        {
                id: "too_many_requests",
                message: "API Rate limit exceeded."
        }
    ```


    ## Curl Examples


    Throughout this document, some example API requests will be given using the

    `curl` command. This will allow us to demonstrate the various endpoints in a

    simple, textual format.


    The names of account-specific references (like Droplet IDs, for instance)

    will be represented by variables. For instance, a Droplet ID may be

    represented by a variable called `$DROPLET_ID`. You can set the associated

    variables in your environment if you wish to use the examples without

    modification.


    The first variable that you should set to get started is your OAuth

    authorization token. The next section will go over the details of this, but

    you can set an environmental variable for it now.


    Generate a token by going to the [Apps & API](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/applications)

    section of the DigitalOcean control panel. Use an existing token if you have

    saved one, or generate a new token with the "Generate new token" button.

    Copy the generated token and use it to set and export the TOKEN variable in

    your environment as the example shows.


    You may also wish to set some other variables now or as you go along. For

    example, you may wish to set the `DROPLET_ID` variable to one of your

    Droplet IDs since this will be used frequently in the API.


    If you are following along, make sure you use a Droplet ID that you control

    so that your commands will execute correctly.


    If you need access to the headers of a response through `curl`, you can pass

    the `-i` flag to display the header information along with the body. If you

    are only interested in the header, you can instead pass the `-I` flag, which

    will exclude the response body entirely.


    ### Set and Export your OAuth Token


    ```

    export DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN=your_token_here

    ```


    ### Set and Export a Variable


    ```

    export DROPLET_ID=1111111

    ```


    ## Parameters


    There are two different ways to pass parameters in a request with the API.


    When passing parameters to create or update an object, parameters should be

    passed as a JSON object containing the appropriate attribute names and

    values as key-value pairs. When you use this format, you should specify that

    you are sending a JSON object in the header. This is done by setting the

    `Content-Type` header to `application/json`. This ensures that your request

    is interpreted correctly.


    When passing parameters to filter a response on GET requests, parameters can

    be passed using standard query attributes. In this case, the parameters

    would be embedded into the URI itself by appending a `?` to the end of the

    URI and then setting each attribute with an equal sign. Attributes can be

    separated with a `&`. Tools like `curl` can create the appropriate URI when

    given parameters and values; this can also be done using the `-F` flag and

    then passing the key and value as an argument. The argument should take the

    form of a quoted string with the attribute being set to a value with an

    equal sign.


    ### Pass Parameters as a JSON Object


    ```
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{"name": "example.com", "ip_address": "127.0.0.1"}' \
            -X POST "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/domains"
    ```


    ### Pass Filter Parameters as a Query String


    ```
         curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN" \
             -X GET \
             "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/images?private=true"
    ```


    ## Cross Origin Resource Sharing


    In order to make requests to the API from other domains, the API implements

    Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support.


    CORS support is generally used to create AJAX requests outside of the domain

    that the request originated from. This is necessary to implement projects

    like control panels utilizing the API. This tells the browser that it can

    send requests to an outside domain.


    The procedure that the browser initiates in order to perform these actions

    (other than GET requests) begins by sending a "preflight" request. This sets

    the `Origin` header and uses the `OPTIONS` method. The server will reply

    back with the methods it allows and some of the limits it imposes. The

    client then sends the actual request if it falls within the allowed

    constraints.


    This process is usually done in the background by the browser, but you can

    use curl to emulate this process using the example provided. The headers

    that will be set to show the constraints are:


    *   **Access-Control-Allow-Origin**: This is the domain that is sent by the client or browser as the origin of the request. It is set through an `Origin` header.

    *   **Access-Control-Allow-Methods**: This specifies the allowed options for requests from that domain. This will generally be all available methods.

    *   **Access-Control-Expose-Headers**: This will contain the headers that will be available to requests from the origin domain.

    *   **Access-Control-Max-Age**: This is the length of time that the access is considered valid. After this expires, a new preflight should be sent.

    *   **Access-Control-Allow-Credentials**: This will be set to `true`. It basically allows you to send your OAuth token for authentication.


    You should not need to be concerned with the details of these headers,

    because the browser will typically do all of the work for you.

      The billing endpoints allow you to retrieve your account balance,
      invoices and billing history.  


      **Balance:** By sending requests to the `/v2/customers/my/balance` endpoint, you can retrieve the balance information for the requested customer account.  


      **Invoices:** [Invoices](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/accounts/billing/invoices/) are generated on the first of each month for every DigitalOcean customer. An invoice preview is generated daily, which can be accessed with the `preview` keyword in place of `$INVOICE_UUID`. To interact with  invoices, you will generally send requests to the invoices endpoint at `/v2/customers/my/invoices`.  


      **Billing History:** Billing history is a record of billing events for your account. For example, entries may include events like payments made, invoices issued, or credits granted. To interact with invoices, you will generally send requests to the invoices endpoint at `/v2/customers/my/billing_history`.

      DigitalOcean's [managed database
      service](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases)

      simplifies the creation and management of highly available database clusters. Currently, it

      offers support for [PostgreSQL](http://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases/postgresql/),

      [Redis](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases/redis/),

      [MySQL](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases/mysql/), and 

      [MongoDB](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases/mongodb/).


      By sending requests to the `/v2/databases` endpoint, you can list, create, or delete

      database clusters as well as scale the size of a cluster, add or remove read-only replicas,

      and manage other configuration details.


      The size of individual nodes in a database cluster is represented by a human-readable slug.

      These slugs denote the underlying Droplet class, amount of RAM, and CPU count for the node.

      Database clusters may be deployed in a multi-node, highly available configuration. In

      addition to the primary node, up to two standby nodes may be added to a cluster with one

      exception. High availability configurations are not available when using the smallest node

      size. The currently available sizes and their corresponding slugs are:


      Size Slug        | RAM   | CPU     | Storage | High Availability Plans

      Domain resources are domain names that you have purchased from a
      domain name registrar that you are managing through the [DigitalOcean DNS
      interface](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/dns/).

      This resource establishes top-level control over each domain. Actions that affect individual domain records should be taken on the [Domain Records](#tag/Domain-Records) resource.

      Droplet actions are tasks that can be executed on a Droplet. These
      can be things like rebooting, resizing, snapshotting, etc.

      Droplet action requests are generally targeted at one of the "actions" endpoints for a specific Droplet. The specific actions are usually initiated by sending a POST request with the action and arguments as parameters.

      Droplet action requests create a Droplet actions object, which can be used to get information about the status of an action. Creating a Droplet action is asynchronous: the HTTP call will return the action object before the action has finished processing on the Droplet. The current status of an action can be retrieved from either the Droplet actions endpoint or the global actions endpoint. If a Droplet action is uncompleted it may block the creation of a subsequent action for that Droplet, the locked attribute of the Droplet will be true and attempts to create a Droplet action will fail with a status of 422.

      Floating IP actions are commands that can be given to a
      DigitalOcean floating IP. These requests are made on the actions endpoint
      of a specific floating IP.

      A DigitalOcean [image](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/)
      can be used to create a Droplet and may come in a number of flavors.
      Currently, there are five types of images: snapshots, backups,
      applications, distributions, and custom images.

      * [Snapshots](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/snapshots/) provide a full copy of an existing Droplet instance taken on demand.

      * [Backups](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/backups/) are similar to snapshots but are created automatically at regular intervals when enabled for a Droplet.

      * [Custom images](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/custom-images/) are Linux-based virtual machine images (raw, qcow2, vhdx, vdi, and vmdk formats are supported) that you may upload for use on DigitalOcean.

      * Distributions are the public Linux distributions that are available to be used as a base to create Droplets.

      * Applications, or [1-Click Apps](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/one-clicks/), are distributions pre-configured with additional software.

      To interact with images, you will generally send requests to the images endpoint at /v2/images.

      Project Resources are resources that can be grouped into your
      projects.

      You can group resources (like Droplets, Spaces, load balancers, domains,

      and floating IPs) in ways that align with the applications you host on

      DigitalOcean.


      ### Supported Resource Types Examples


      Projects resources are identified by uniform resource names or URNs. A

      valid URN has the following format: `do:resource_type:resource_id`. The

      following resource types are supported:


      Resource Type | Example URN

      --------------|------------

      Database      | `do:dbaas:83c7a55f-0d84-4760-9245-aba076ec2fb2`

      Domain        | `do:domain:example.com`

      Droplet       | `do:droplet:4126873`

      Floating IP   | `do:floatingip:192.168.99.100`

      Load Balancer | `do:loadbalancer:39052d89-8dd4-4d49-8d5a-3c3b6b365b5b`

      Space         | `do:space:my-website-assets`

      Volume        | `do:volume:6fc4c277-ea5c-448a-93cd-dd496cfef71f`


      ### Resource Status Codes


      When assigning and retrieving resources in projects, a `status` attribute

      is returned that indicates if a resource was successfully retrieved or

      assigned. The status codes can be one of the following:


      Status Code | Explanation

      ------------|------------

      `ok`          | There was no problem retrieving or assigning a resource.

      `not_found`   | The resource was not found.

      `assigned`    | The resource was successfully assigned.

      `already_assigned` | The resource was already assigned.

      `service_down`     | There was a problem retrieving or assigning a resource. Please try again.

      The sizes objects represent different packages of hardware
      resources that can be used for Droplets. When a Droplet is created, a size
      must be selected so that the correct resources can be allocated.

      Each size represents a plan that bundles together specific sets of resources. This includes the amount of RAM, the number of virtual CPUs, disk space, and transfer. The size object also includes the pricing details and the regions that the size is available in.

      [Snapshots](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/snapshots/)
      are saved instances of a Droplet or a block storage volume, which is
      reflected in the `resource_type` attribute. In order to avoid problems
      with compressing filesystems, each defines a `min_disk_size` attribute
      which is the minimum size of the Droplet or volume disk when creating a
      new resource from the saved snapshot.

      To interact with snapshots, you will generally send requests to the snapshots endpoint at `/v2/snapshots`.

      A tag is a label that can be applied to a resource (currently
      Droplets, Images, Volumes, Volume Snapshots, and Database clusters) in
      order to better organize or facilitate the lookups and actions on it.

      Tags have two attributes: a user defined `name` attribute and an embedded `resources` attribute with information about resources that have been tagged.

        To create a database cluster, send a POST request to
        `/v2/databases`.

        The response will be a JSON object with a key called `database`. The value of this will be an object that contains the standard attributes associated with a database cluster. The initial value of the database cluster's `status` attribute will be `creating`. When the cluster is ready to receive traffic, this will transition to `online`.

        The embedded `connection` and `private_connection` objects will contain the information needed to access the database cluster.

        DigitalOcean managed PostgreSQL and MySQL database clusters take automated daily backups. To create a new database cluster based on a backup of an exising cluster, send a POST request to `/v2/databases`. In addition to the standard database cluster attributes, the JSON body must include a key named `backup_restore` with the name of the original database cluster and the timestamp of the backup to be restored.

        Note: Backups are not supported for Redis clusters.

        For PostgreSQL database clusters, connection pools can be used to
        allow a

        database to share its idle connections. The popular PostgreSQL connection

        pooling utility PgBouncer is used to provide this service. [See here for more information](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases/postgresql/how-to/manage-connection-pools/)

        about how and why to use PgBouncer connection pooling including

        details about the available transaction modes.


        To add a new connection pool to a PostgreSQL database cluster, send a POST

        request to `/v2/databases/$DATABASE_ID/pools` specifying a name for the pool,

        the user to connect with, the database to connect to, as well as its desired

        size and transaction mode.

        To get a listing of all records configured for a domain, send a GET
        request to `/v2/domains/$DOMAIN_NAME/records`.

        The list of records returned can be filtered by using the `name` and `type` query parameters. For example, to only include A records for a domain, send a GET request to `/v2/domains/$DOMAIN_NAME/records?type=A`. `name` must be a fully qualified record name. For example, to only include records matching `sub.example.com`, send a GET request to `/v2/domains/$DOMAIN_NAME/records?name=sub.example.com`. Both name and type may be used together.

        The response body will be a JSON object with a key of `droplets`. This will be

        set to an array containing objects each representing a Droplet. These will

        contain the standard Droplet attributes.


        ### Filtering Results by Tag


        It's possible to request filtered results by including certain query parameters.

        To only list Droplets assigned to a specific tag, include the `tag_name` query

        parameter set to the name of the tag in your GET request. For example,

        `/v2/droplets?tag_name=$TAG_NAME`.

        To create a new Droplet, send a POST request to `/v2/droplets`
        setting the

        required attributes.


        A Droplet will be created using the provided information. The response body

        will contain a JSON object with a key called `droplet`. The value will be an

        object containing the standard attributes for your new Droplet. The response

        code, 202 Accepted, does not indicate the success or failure of the operation,

        just that the request has been accepted for processing. The `actions` returned

        as part of the response's `links` object can be used to check the status

        of the Droplet create event.


        ### Create Multiple Droplets


        Creating multiple Droplets is very similar to creating a single Droplet.

        Instead of sending `name` as a string, send `names` as an array of strings. A

        Droplet will be created for each name you send using the associated

        information. Up to ten Droplets may be created this way at a time.


        Rather than returning a single Droplet, the response body will contain a JSON

        array with a key called `droplets`. This will be set to an array of JSON

        objects, each of which will contain the standard Droplet attributes. The

        response code, 202 Accepted, does not indicate the success or failure of any

        operation, just that the request has been accepted for processing. The array

        of `actions` returned as part of the response's `links` object can be used to

        check the status of each individual Droplet create event.

        To initiate an action on a Droplet send a POST request to

        `/v2/droplets/$DROPLET_ID/actions`. In the JSON body to the request,

        set the `type` attribute to on of the supported action types:


        | Action                                   | Details |

        | ---------------------------------------- | ----------- |

        | <nobr>`enable_backups`</nobr>            | Enables backups for a Droplet |

        | <nobr>`disable_backups`</nobr>           | Disables backups for a Droplet |

        | <nobr>`reboot`</nobr>                    | Reboots a Droplet. A `reboot` action is an attempt to reboot the Droplet in a graceful way, similar to using the `reboot` command from the console. |

        | <nobr>`power_cycle`</nobr>               | Power cycles a Droplet. A `powercycle` action is similar to pushing the reset button on a physical machine, it's similar to booting from scratch. |

        | <nobr>`shutdown`</nobr>                  | Shutsdown a Droplet. A shutdown action is an attempt to shutdown the Droplet in a graceful way, similar to using the `shutdown` command from the console. Since a `shutdown` command can fail, this action guarantees that the command is issued, not that it succeeds. The preferred way to turn off a Droplet is to attempt a shutdown, with a reasonable timeout, followed by a `power_off` action to ensure the Droplet is off. |

        | <nobr>`power_off`</nobr>                 | Powers off a Droplet. A `power_off` event is a hard shutdown and should only be used if the `shutdown` action is not successful. It is similar to cutting the power on a server and could lead to complications. |

        | <nobr>`power_on`</nobr>                  | Powers on a Droplet. |

        | <nobr>`restore`</nobr>                   | Restore a Droplet using a backup image. The image ID that is passed in must be a backup of the current Droplet instance. The operation will leave any embedded SSH keys intact. |

        | <nobr>`password_reset`</nobr>            | Resets the root password for a Droplet. A new password will be provided via email. It must be changed after first use. |

        | <nobr>`resize`</nobr>                    | Resizes a Droplet. Set the `size` attribute to a size slug. If a permanent resize with disk changes included is desired, set the `disk` attribute to `true`. |

        | <nobr>`rebuild`</nobr>                   | Rebuilds a Droplet from a new base image. Set the `image` attribute to an image ID or slug. |

        | <nobr>`rename`</nobr>                    | Renames a Droplet. |

        | <nobr>`change_kernel`</nobr>             | Changes a Droplet's kernel. Only applies to Droplets with externally managed kernels. All Droplets created after March 2017 use internal kernels by default. |

        | <nobr>`enable_ipv6`</nobr>               | Enables IPv6 for a Droplet. |

        | <nobr>`snapshot`</nobr>                  | Takes a snapshot of a Droplet. |

        resources, send a

        DELETE request to the `/v2/droplets/$DROPLET_ID/destroy_with_associated_resources/selective`

        endpoint. The JSON body of the request should include `snapshots`, `volumes`,

        or `volume_snapshots` keys each set to an array of IDs for the associated

        resources to be destroyed. The IDs can be found by querying the Droplet's

        associated resources. Any associated resource not included in the request

        will remain and continue to accrue changes on your account.


        A successful response will include a 202 response code and no content. Use

        the status endpoint to check on the success or failure of the destruction of

        the individual resources.

        On creation, a floating IP must be either assigned to a Droplet or
        reserved to a region.

        * To create a new floating IP assigned to a Droplet, send a POST
          request to `/v2/floating_ips` with the `droplet_id` attribute.

        * To create a new floating IP reserved to a region, send a POST request to
          `/v2/floating_ips` with the `region` attribute.

        **Note**:  In addition to the standard rate limiting, only 12 floating IPs may be created per 60 seconds.

            The value of this will be an object that contains the standard
            attributes associated with a floating IP.

            When assigning a floating IP to a Droplet at same time as it created, the response's `links` object will contain links to both the Droplet and the assignment action. The latter can be used to check the status of the action.

        ## Filtering Results

        -----


        It's possible to request filtered results by including certain query parameters.


        **Image Type**


        Either 1-Click Application or OS Distribution images can be filtered by using the `type` query parameter.


        > Important: The `type` query parameter does not directly relate to the `type` attribute.


        To retrieve only ***distribution*** images, include the `type` query parameter set to distribution, `/v2/images?type=distribution`.


        To retrieve only ***application*** images, include the `type` query parameter set to application, `/v2/images?type=application`.


        **User Images**


        To retrieve only the private images of a user, include the `private` query parameter set to true, `/v2/images?private=true`.


        **Tags**


        To list all images assigned to a specific tag, include the `tag_name` query parameter set to the name of the tag in your GET request. For example, `/v2/images?tag_name=$TAG_NAME`.
      operationId: get_images_list
      parameters:

        To create a new Kubernetes cluster, send a POST request to

        `/v2/kubernetes/clusters`. The request must contain at least one node pool

        with at least one worker.


        The request may contain a maintenance window policy describing a time period

        when disruptive maintenance tasks may be carried out. Omitting the policy

        implies that a window will be chosen automatically. See

        [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/kubernetes/how-to/upgrade-cluster/)

        for details.

                  This example request creates a Kubernetes cluster with two node
                  pools. It

                  also demonstrates setting tags, labels, auto scaling, and a maintenance

                  policy.

            value of this will be an object containing the standard attributes of a

            Kubernetes cluster.


            The IP address and cluster API server endpoint will not be available until the

            cluster has finished provisioning. The initial value of the cluster's

            this will transition to `running`.

        resources, security and reliability to avoid common problems while operating

        or upgrading the clusters.


        To request a clusterlint run on your cluster, send a POST request to

        `/v2/kubernetes/clusters/$K8S_CLUSTER_ID/clusterlint`. This will run all

        checks present in the `doks` group by default, if a request body is not

        specified. Optionally specify the below attributes.


        For information about the available checks, please refer to

        This endpoint returns a JSON object . It can be used to

        construct Kubernetes clients which cannot parse kubeconfig files.


        The resulting JSON object contains token-based authentication for clusters

        supporting it, and certificate-based authentication otherwise. For a list of

        supported versions and more information, see "[How to Connect to a DigitalOcean

        Kubernetes Cluster with kubectl](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/kubernetes/how-to/connect-with-kubectl/)".


        To retrieve credentials for accessing a Kubernetes cluster, send a GET

        request to `/v2/kubernetes/clusters/$K8S_CLUSTER_ID/credentials`.


        Clusters supporting token-based authentication may define an expiration by

        passing a duration in seconds as a query parameter to

        `/v2/kubernetes/clusters/$K8S_CLUSTER_ID/kubeconfig?expiry_seconds=$DURATION_IN_SECONDS`.

        If not set or 0, then the token will have a 7 day expiry. The query parameter

        has no impact in certificate-based authentication.

        `kubectl`, or other programs supporting kubeconfig files (e.g., client libraries).


        The resulting kubeconfig file uses token-based authentication for clusters

        supporting it, and certificate-based authentication otherwise. For a list of

        supported versions and more information, see "[How to Connect to a DigitalOcean

        Kubernetes Cluster with kubectl](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/kubernetes/how-to/connect-with-kubectl/)".


        To retrieve a kubeconfig file for use with a Kubernetes cluster, send a GET

        request to `/v2/kubernetes/clusters/$K8S_CLUSTER_ID/kubeconfig`.


        Clusters supporting token-based authentication may define an expiration by

        passing a duration in seconds as a query parameter to

        `/v2/kubernetes/clusters/$K8S_CLUSTER_ID/kubeconfig?expiry_seconds=$DURATION_IN_SECONDS`.

        If not set or 0, then the token will have a 7 day expiry. The query parameter

        has no impact in certificate-based authentication.

        You can specify the Droplets that will sit behind the load balancer using one

        of two methods:


        * Set `droplet_ids` to a list of specific Droplet IDs.

        * Set `tag` to the name of a tag. All Droplets with this tag applied will be
          assigned to the load balancer. Additional Droplets will be automatically
          assigned as they are tagged.

        These methods are mutually exclusive.

      description: >
        In order to access your container registry with the Docker client
        or from a

        Kubernetes cluster, you will need to configure authentication. The necessary

        JSON configuration can be retrieved by sending a GET request to

        `/v2/registry/docker-credentials`.


        The response will be in the format of a Docker `config.json` file. To use the

        config in your Kubernetes cluster, create a Secret with:

            kubectl create secret generic docr \

              --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson

        By default, the returned credentials have read-only access to your registry

        and cannot be used to push images. This is appropriate for most Kubernetes

        clusters. To retrieve read/write credentials, suitable for use with the Docker

        client or in a CI system, read_write may be provided as query parameter. For

        example: `/v2/registry/docker-credentials?read_write=true`

        Garbage collection enables users to clear out unreferenced blobs
        (layer &

        manifest data) after deleting one or more manifests from a repository. If

        there are no unreferenced blobs resulting from the deletion of one or more

        manifests, garbage collection is effectively a noop.

        [See here for more information](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/container-registry/how-to/clean-up-container-registry/)

        about how and why you should clean up your container registry periodically.


        To request a garbage collection run on your registry, send a POST request to

        `/v2/registry/$REGISTRY_NAME/garbage-collection`. This will initiate the

        following sequence of events on your registry.


        * Set the registry to read-only mode, meaning no further write-scoped
          JWTs will be issued to registry clients. Existing write-scoped JWTs will
          continue to work until they expire which can take up to 15 minutes.
        * Wait until all existing write-scoped JWTs have expired.

        * Scan all registry manifests to determine which blobs are unreferenced.

        * Delete all unreferenced blobs from the registry.

        * Record the number of blobs deleted and bytes freed, mark the garbage
          collection status as `success`.
        * Remove the read-only mode restriction from the registry, meaning write-scoped
          JWTs will once again be issued to registry clients.

        To list all of the snapshots available on your account, send a GET
        request to

        `/v2/snapshots`.


        The response will be a JSON object with a key called `snapshots`. This will be

        set to an array of `snapshot` objects, each of which will contain the standard

        snapshot attributes.


        ### Filtering Results by Resource Type


        It's possible to request filtered results by including certain query parameters.


        #### List Droplet Snapshots


        To retrieve only snapshots based on Droplets, include the `resource_type`

        query parameter set to `droplet`. For example, `/v2/snapshots?resource_type=droplet`.


        #### List Volume Snapshots


        To retrieve only snapshots based on volumes, include the `resource_type`

        query parameter set to `volume`. For example, `/v2/snapshots?resource_type=volume`.

                            Droplets, Images, Volumes, Volume Snapshots, and
                            Database clusters) in order to better organize or
                            facilitate the lookups and actions on it.

                            Tags have two attributes: a user defined `name` attribute and an embedded `resources` attribute with information about resources that have been tagged.
                          properties:
                            name:

                                The name of the tag. Tags may contain letters, numbers, colons,
                                dashes, and underscores.

                                There is a limit of 255 characters per tag.


                                **Note:** Tag names are case stable, which means the capitalization you use when you first create a tag is canonical.


                                When working with tags in the API, you must use the tag's canonical capitalization. For example, if you create a tag named "PROD", the URL to add that tag to a resource would be `https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/tags/PROD/resources` (not `/v2/tags/prod/resources`).


                                Tagged resources in the control panel will always display the canonical capitalization. For example, if you create a tag named "PROD", you can tag resources in the control panel by entering "prod". The tag will still display with its canonical capitalization, "PROD".

        Resources can be tagged by sending a POST request to
        `/v2/tags/$TAG_NAME/resources` with an array of json objects containing
        `resource_id` and `resource_type` attributes.

        Currently only tagging of Droplets, Images, Volumes, and Volume Snapshots is supported. `resource_id` is expected to be the Droplet's id, Image's id, or Volume/Volume Snapshot's UUID attribute as a string, and `resource_type` is expected to be the string `droplet`, `image`, `volume` or `volume_snapshot`.

        To list all of the block storage volumes available on your account,
        send a GET request to `/v2/volumes`.

        ## Filtering Results

        ### By Region

        The `region` may be provided as query paramater in order to restrict results to volumes available in a specific region. For example: `/v2/volumes?region=nyc1`

        ### By Name

        It is also possible to list volumes on your account that match a specified name. To do so, send a GET request with the volume's name as a query parameter to `/v2/volumes?name=$VOLUME_NAME`.

        **Note:** You can only create one volume per region with the same name.

        ### By Name and Region

        It is also possible to retrieve information about a block storage volume by name. To do so, send a GET request with the volume's name and the region slug for the region it is located in as query parameters to `/v2/volumes?name=$VOLUME_NAME&region=nyc1`.

        Each volume may only be attached to a single Droplet. However, up to five

        volumes may be attached to a Droplet at a time. Pre-formatted volumes will be

        automatically mounted to Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Fedora Atomic, and CentOS

        Droplets created on or after April 26, 2018 when attached. On older Droplets,

        [additional configuration](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-partition-and-format-digitalocean-block-storage-volumes-in-linux#mounting-the-filesystems)

        ## Attach a Block Storage Volume to a Droplet


        | Attribute  | Details                                                             |

        | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |

        | type       | This must be `attach`                                               |

        | region     | Set to the slug representing the region where the volume is located |


        Each volume may only be attached to a single Droplet. However, up to five

        volumes may be attached to a Droplet at a time. Pre-formatted volumes will be

        automatically mounted to Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Fedora Atomic, and CentOS

        Droplets created on or after April 26, 2018 when attached. On older Droplets,

        [additional configuration](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-partition-and-format-digitalocean-block-storage-volumes-in-linux#mounting-the-filesystems)

        is required.

        | size_gigabytes | The new size of the block storage volume in GiB (1024^3)            |

        | region         | Set to the slug representing the region where the volume is located |


        Volumes may only be resized upwards. The maximum size for a volume is 16TiB.

        ## OAuth Authentication


        In order to interact with the DigitalOcean API, you or your application must

        authenticate.


        The DigitalOcean API handles this through OAuth, an open standard for

        authorization. OAuth allows you to delegate access to your account in full

        or in read-only mode.


        You can generate an OAuth token by visiting the [Apps & API](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/applications)

        section of the DigitalOcean control panel for your account.


        An OAuth token functions as a complete authentication request. In effect, it

        acts as a substitute for a username and password pair.


        Because of this, it is absolutely **essential** that you keep your OAuth

        tokens secure. In fact, upon generation, the web interface will only display

        each token a single time in order to prevent the token from being compromised.


        ### How to Authenticate with OAuth


        In order to make an authenticated request, include a bearer-type

        `Authorization` header containing your OAuth token. All requests must be

        made over HTTPS.


        ### Authenticate with a Bearer Authorization Header


        ```

        curl -X $HTTP_METHOD -H "Authorization: Bearer $DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN" "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/$OBJECT"

        ```
      scheme: bearer
      type: http
