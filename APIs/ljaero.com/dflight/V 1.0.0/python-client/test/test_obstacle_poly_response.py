    DFlight API

    [DFlight API](https://ljaero.com/solutions/dflight/) supplies the up-to-date information needed for compliance with UAV preflight assessment requirements. Separate endpoints are available for each of the following information categories: - Airspace - Weather - Temporary Flight Restrictions - Special Security Areas - Restricted Public Venues - Surface Obstacles - Aerodromes - UAS Operating Areas  You can define your geographic area of interest in one of three convenient ways: - Providing a latitude/longitude point and distance around that point - Providing a GeoJSON LineString defining your route - Providing an arbitrary GeoJSON Polygon defining your area of interest
