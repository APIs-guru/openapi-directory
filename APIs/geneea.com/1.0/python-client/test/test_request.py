    <div class=\"api-description\">     <h2>Authentication</h2>     <p>For all calls, supply your API key. <a href=\"https://www.geneea.com/pricing\">Sign up to <em>obtain the key</em></a>.</p>     <p>         Our API supports both <em>unencrypted (HTTP)</em> and <em>encrypted (HTTPS)</em> protocols.         However, for security reasons, we strongly encourage using only the encrypted version.     </p>     <p>The API key should be supplied as either a request parameter <code>user_key</code> or in <code>Authorization</code> header.</p>     <pre><code>Authorization: user_key &lt;YOUR_API_KEY&gt;</code></pre>      <h2>API operations</h2>     <p>         All API operations can perform analysis on supplied raw text or on text extracted from a given URL.         Optionally, one can supply additional information which can make the result more precise. An example         of such information would be the language of text or a particular text extractor for URL resources.     </p>     <p>The supported types of analyses are:</p>     <ul>         <li><strong>lemmatization</strong> &longrightarrow;             Finds out lemmata (basic forms) of all the words in the document.         </li>         <li><strong>correction</strong> &longrightarrow;             Performs correction (diacritization) on all the words in the document.         </li>         <li><strong>topic detection</strong> &longrightarrow;             Determines a topic of the document, e.g. finance or sports.         </li>         <li><strong>sentiment analysis</strong> &longrightarrow;             Determines a sentiment of the document, i.e. how positive or negative the document is.         </li>         <li><strong>named entity recognition</strong> &longrightarrow;             Finds named entities (like person, location, date etc.) mentioned the the document.         </li>     </ul>      <h2>Encoding</h2>     <p>The supplied text is expected to be in UTF-8 encoding, this is especially important for non-english texts.</p>      <h2>Returned values</h2>     <p>The API calls always return objects in serialized JSON format in UTF-8 encoding.</p>     <p>         If any error occurs, the HTTP response code will be in the range <code>4xx</code> (client-side error) or         <code>5xx</code> (server-side error). In this situation, the body of the response will contain information         about the error in JSON format, with <code>exception</code> and <code>message</code> values.     </p>      <h2>URL limitations</h2>     <p>         All the requests are semantically <code>GET</code>. However, for longer texts, you may run into issues         with URL length limit. Therefore, it's possible to always issue a <code>POST</code> request with all         the parameters encoded as a JSON in the request body.     </p>     <p>Example:</p>     <pre><code>         POST /s1/sentiment         Content-Type: application/json          {\"text\":\"There is no harm in being sometimes wrong - especially if one is promptly found out.\"}     </code></pre>     <p>This is equivalent to <code>GET /s1/sentiment?text=There%20is%20no%20harm...</code></p>      <h2>Request limitations</h2>     <p>         The API has other limitations concerning the size of the HTTP requests. The maximum allowed size of any         POST request body is <em>512 KiB</em>. For request with a URL resource, the maximum allowed number of         extracted characters from each such resource is <em>100,000</em>.     </p>      <h2>Terms of Service</h2>     <p>         By using the API, you agree to our         <a href=\"https://www.geneea.com/terms.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service Agreement</a>.     </p>      <h2>More information</h2>     <p>         <a href=\"https://help.geneea.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">         The Interpretor Public Documentation         </a>     </p> </div>
