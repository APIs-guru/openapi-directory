    **Base API URL**: https://api.configcat.com


    If you prefer the swagger documentation, you can find it here: [Swagger UI](https://api.configcat.com/swagger).


    The purpose of this API is to access the ConfigCat platform programmatically. 

    You can **Create**, **Read**, **Update** and **Delete** any entities like **Feature Flags, Configs, Environments** or **Products** within ConfigCat. 


    The API is based on HTTP REST, uses resource-oriented URLs, status codes and supports JSON 

    and JSON+HAL format. Do not use this API for accessing and evaluating feature flag values. Use the [SDKs instead](https://configcat.com/docs/sdk-reference/overview).



    # OpenAPI Specification


    The complete specification is publicly available here: [swagger.json](v1/swagger.json). 

    You can use it to generate client libraries in various languages with [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) or

    [Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/) to interact with this API.


    # Authentication

    This API uses the [Basic HTTP Authentication Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). 


    <!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->


    # Throttling and rate limits

    All the rate limited API calls are returning information about the current rate limit period in the following HTTP headers:


    | Header | Description |

    | :- | :- |

    | X-Rate-Limit-Remaining | The maximum number of requests remaining in the current rate limit period. |

    | X-Rate-Limit-Reset     | The time	when the current rate limit period resets.						  |


    When the rate limit is exceeded by a request, the API returns with a `HTTP 429 - Too many requests` status along with a `Retry-After` HTTP header.

      With these endpoints you can control how your existing Feature
      Flags and Settings should serve their values. 

      You can turn Feature Flags on or off, update Setting values and also add, remove or change the order of Percentage and Targeting Rules.


      These endpoints are determining the Environment and Config by the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://app.configcat.com/sdkkey">SDK key</a> passed in

      the `X-CONFIGCAT-SDKKEY` request header. To identify the desired Feature Flag or Setting to change, 

      you can use either its `settingId` or `key` attribute. You can get those attributes 

      from the [Feature Flag & Setting](#tag/Feature-Flags-and-Settings) endpoints.

      With these endpoints you can control how your existing Feature
      Flags and Settings should serve their values. 

      You can turn Feature Flags on or off, update Setting values and also add, remove or reorder Percentage and Targeting Rules.


      To determine which Feature Flag or Setting you want to work with you have to pass its `settingId`. It can be

      obtained from the [Feature Flag & Setting](#tag/Feature-Flags-and-Settings) endpoints.


      You also have to specify in which Environment you want to change the served value configuration by its

      `environmentId` which can be obtained from the [List Environments](#operation/get-environments) endpoint.
    name: Feature Flag & Setting values
  - description: >-
      With these endpoints you can manage your Feature Flags or Settings
      within a Config. 

      However you can't use them for manipulating the values of your Feature Flags and Settings,

      to do that please visit the [Feature Flag & Setting values using SDK Key](#tag/Feature-Flag-and-Setting-values-using-SDK-Key)

      and [Feature Flag & Setting values](#tag/Feature-Flag-and-Setting-values) sections of the API.


      For using these endpoints, first you have to select which Config you want to work with by its `configId` 

      which can be obtained from the [List Configs](#operation/get-configs) endpoint. 

      Then you can use it to create new Feature Flags or to get information about existing ones.


      Then you can obtain the `settingId` or `key` of your desired Feature Flag or Setting 

      to use them for further operations in this API.

    get:
      description: >-
        This endpoint returns the value of a Feature Flag or Setting 

        in a specified Environment identified by the `environmentId` parameter.


        The most important attributes in the response are the `value`, `rolloutRules` and `percentageRules`.

        The `value` represents what the clients will get when the evaluation requests of our SDKs 

        are not matching to any of the defined Targeting or Percentage Rules, or when there are no additional rules to evaluate.


        The `rolloutRules` and `percentageRules` attributes are representing the current 

        Targeting and Percentage Rules configuration of the actual Feature Flag or Setting 

        in an **ordered** collection, which means the order of the returned rules is matching to the

        evaluation order. You can read more about these rules [here](https://configcat.com/docs/advanced/targeting/).

        This endpoint updates the value of a Feature Flag or Setting 

        with a collection of [JSON Patch](http://jsonpatch.com) operations in a specified Environment.


        Only the `value`, `rolloutRules` and `percentageRules` attributes are modifiable by this endpoint.


        The advantage of using JSON Patch is that you can describe individual update operations on a resource

        without touching attributes that you don't want to change. It supports collection reordering, so it also 

        can be used for reordering the targeting rules of a Feature Flag or Setting.


        For example: We have the following resource.

        ```

        {
        	"rolloutPercentageItems": [
        		{
        			"percentage": 30,
        			"value": true
        		},
        		{
        			"percentage": 70,
        			"value": false
        		}
        	],
        	"rolloutRules": [],
        	"value": false
        }

        ```

        If we send an update request body as below:

        ```

        [
        	{
        		"op": "replace",
        		"path": "/value",
        		"value": true
        	}
        ]

        ```

        Only the default value is going to be set to `true` and all the Percentage Rules are remaining unchanged.

        So we get a response like this:

        ```

        {
        	"rolloutPercentageItems": [
        		{
        			"percentage": 30,
        			"value": true
        		},
        		{
        			"percentage": 70,
        			"value": false
        		}
        	],
        	"rolloutRules": [],
        	"value": true
        }

        ```

        This endpoint replaces the whole value of a Feature Flag or Setting
        in a specified Environment.


        Only the `value`, `rolloutRules` and `percentageRules` attributes are modifiable by this endpoint.


        **Important:** As this endpoint is doing a complete replace, it's important to set every other attribute that you don't 

        want to change in its original state. Not listing one means that it will reset.


        For example: We have the following resource.

        ```

        {
        	"rolloutPercentageItems": [
        		{
        			"percentage": 30,
        			"value": true
        		},
        		{
        			"percentage": 70,
        			"value": false
        		}
        	],
        	"rolloutRules": [],
        	"value": false
        }

        ```

        If we send a replace request body as below:

        ```

        {
        	"value": true
        }

        ```

        Then besides that the default value is set to `true`, all the Percentage Rules are deleted. 

        So we get a response like this:

        ```

        {
        	"rolloutPercentageItems": [],
        	"rolloutRules": [],
        	"value": true
        }

        ```

    patch:
      description: >-
        This endpoint updates the metadata of a Feature Flag or Setting 

        with a collection of [JSON Patch](http://jsonpatch.com) operations in a specified Config.


        Only the `name`, `hint` and `tags` attributes are modifiable by this endpoint.

        The `tags` attribute is a simple collection of the [tag IDs](#operation/get-tags) attached to the given setting.


        The advantage of using JSON Patch is that you can describe individual update operations on a resource

        without touching attributes that you don't want to change.


        For example: We have the following resource.

        ```

        {
        	"settingId": 5345,
        	"key": "myAwesomeFeature",
        	"name": "Tihs is a naem with soem typos.",
        	"hint": "This Flag controls my awesome feature.",
        	"settingType": "boolean",
        	"tags": [
        		{
        			"tagId": 0,
        			"name": "sample tag",
        			"color": "whale"
        		}
        	]
        }

        ```

        If we send an update request body as below (it changes the name and adds the already existing tag with the id 2):

        ```

        [
        	{
        		"op": "replace",
        		"path": "/name",
        		"value": "This is the name without typos."
        	},
        	{
        		"op": "add",
        		"path": "/tags/-",
        		"value": 2
        	}
        ]

        ```

        Only the `name` and `tags` are going to be updated and all the other attributes are remaining unchanged.

        So we get a response like this:

        ```

        {
        	"settingId": 5345,
        	"key": "myAwesomeFeature",
        	"name": "This is the name without typos.",
        	"hint": "This Flag controls my awesome feature.",
        	"settingType": "boolean",
        	"tags": [
        		{
        			"tagId": 0,
        			"name": "sample tag",
        			"color": "whale"
        		},
        		{
        			"tagId": 2,
        			"name": "another tag",
        			"color": "koala"
        		}
        	]
        }

        ```

        The most important attributes in the response are the `value`, `rolloutRules` and `percentageRules`.

        The `value` represents what the clients will get when the evaluation requests of our SDKs

        The `rolloutRules` and `percentageRules` attributes are representing the current 

        Targeting and Percentage Rules configuration of the actual Feature Flag or Setting 

        in an **ordered** collection, which means the order of the returned rules is matching to the

        evaluation order. You can read more about these rules [here](https://configcat.com/docs/advanced/targeting/).

        Only the `value`, `rolloutRules` and `percentageRules` attributes are modifiable by this endpoint.


        The advantage of using JSON Patch is that you can describe individual update operations on a resource

        without touching attributes that you don't want to change. It supports collection reordering, so it also 

        can be used for reordering the targeting rules of a Feature Flag or Setting.


        For example: We have the following resource.

        ```

        {
        	"rolloutPercentageItems": [
        		{
        			"percentage": 30,
        			"value": true
        		},
        		{
        			"percentage": 70,
        			"value": false
        		}
        	],
        	"rolloutRules": [],
        	"value": false
        }

        ```

        If we send an update request body as below:

        ```

        [
        	{
        		"op": "replace",
        		"path": "/value",
        		"value": true
        	}
        ]

        ```

        Only the default served value is going to be set to `true` and all the Percentage Rules are remaining unchanged.

        So we get a response like this:

        ```

        {
        	"rolloutPercentageItems": [
        		{
        			"percentage": 30,
        			"value": true
        		},
        		{
        			"percentage": 70,
        			"value": false
        		}
        	],
        	"rolloutRules": [],
        	"value": true
        }

        ```

        This endpoint replaces the value of a Feature Flag or Setting 

        in a specified Environment identified by the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://app.configcat.com/sdkkey">SDK key</a> passed in the `X-CONFIGCAT-SDKKEY` header.


        Only the `value`, `rolloutRules` and `percentageRules` attributes are modifiable by this endpoint.


        **Important:** As this endpoint is doing a complete replace, it's important to set every other attribute that you don't 

        want to change to its original state. Not listing one means that it will reset.


        For example: We have the following resource.

        ```

        {
        	"rolloutPercentageItems": [
        		{
        			"percentage": 30,
        			"value": true
        		},
        		{
        			"percentage": 70,
        			"value": false
        		}
        	],
        	"rolloutRules": [],
        	"value": false
        }

        ```

        If we send a replace request body as below:

        ```

        {
        	"value": true
        }

        ```

        Then besides that the default served value is set to `true`, all the Percentage Rules are deleted. 

        So we get a response like this:

        ```

        {
        	"rolloutPercentageItems": [],
        	"rolloutRules": [],
        	"value": true
        }
