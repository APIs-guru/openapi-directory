# openapi-client
Hyperlocal Demographics, Vehicle Traffic, Economic, Market Signals, and More. Use this API to request IdealSpot hyperlocal geospatial market insight and geometry data. 

## Detailed Description

Use this API as your **local economy microscope** by querying [IdealSpot](https://www.idealspot.com) hyperlocal market insight and geometry data. We offer the most precise, extensive, and frequently-updated local market data in the US. Our data is available across the entire US and can be queried at geographic scales ranging from the micro (Census block) through the macro (nation).

Better data and analysis leads to a better understanding of local market opportunities and risks. Integrate with your commercial real estate and marketing applications, machine learning workflows, and other investment analytics.

Our goal is to offer the most complete snapshot of the geographically distributed consumer and retail economy. We start with the fundamentals of consumers and business establishments. To connect retailers with consumers, we provide mobility data like vehicle traffic and mobile device data. To describe consumer intent, we provide geolocated digital marketing data. 

We believe that accurate capital allocation through reliable local market data is foundational to creating robust, healthy, and livable communities for all. We hope you and your clients find tremendous value in this service.

## Features

Query data and GeoJSON geometries at these scales for any US latitude and longitude:

* Rings (0.5 km+)
* Drive time (1-60 minutes)
* Bike time (3-60 minutes)
* Walk time (5-60 minutes)
* Public transit time (5-60 minutes)
* Administrative region (US, states, core-based statistical areas, counties, Census-designated places, Census tracts, zipcodes, Census block groups, opportunity zones)

Mobile device visit counts, points of interest, brands | Fresh point of interest data across 3000+ brands, millions of POI, and historical foot traffic counts using mobile data for those points of interest
Origin/destination trips from mobile devices | Map origins and destinations of devices visiting an arbitrary catchment area
Competition search | Search all major point-of-interest aggregators in one query
Environment/climate | Expected weather patterns like temperature and precipitation
Filter search API | Query data for all counties in state, all tracts in MSA, etc
Road segment tiles | Plot road segments on maps in interactive applications

(or `sudo python setup.py install` to install the package for all users)

Then import the package:
```python
import openapi_client
```

### Tests

Execute `pytest` to run the tests.

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation procedure](#installation--usage) and then run the following:

```python

import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://idealspot-geodata.p.rapidapi.com/api/v1
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://idealspot-geodata.p.rapidapi.com/api/v1"
)



# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.GeometriesAPIApi(api_client)
    latitude = 3.4 # float | (Required) Search coordinate latitude
    longitude = 3.4 # float | (Required) Search coordinate longitude
    x_rapid_api_key = 'x_rapid_api_key_example' # str | (Required) Rapid API Key. See https://rapidapi.com/idealspot-inc-idealspot-inc-default/api/idealspot-geodata
    x_rapid_api_host = 'x_rapid_api_host_example' # str | 

    try:
        # Fetch Administrative Regions using Lat/Lng
        api_response = api_instance.fetch_administrative_regionsusing_lat_lng(latitude, longitude, x_rapid_api_key, x_rapid_api_host)
        print("The response of GeometriesAPIApi->fetch_administrative_regionsusing_lat_lng:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling GeometriesAPIApi->fetch_administrative_regionsusing_lat_lng: %s\n" % e)

```
