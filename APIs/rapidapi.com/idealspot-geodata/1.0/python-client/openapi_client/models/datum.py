    IdealSpot GeoData

    Hyperlocal Demographics, Vehicle Traffic, Economic, Market Signals, and More. Use this API to request IdealSpot hyperlocal geospatial market insight and geometry data.   ## Detailed Description  Use this API as your **local economy microscope** by querying [IdealSpot](https://www.idealspot.com) hyperlocal market insight and geometry data. We offer the most precise, extensive, and frequently-updated local market data in the US. Our data is available across the entire US and can be queried at geographic scales ranging from the micro (Census block) through the macro (nation).  Better data and analysis leads to a better understanding of local market opportunities and risks.

Our goal is to offer the most complete snapshot of the geographically distributed consumer and retail economy. We start with the fundamentals of consumers and business establishments. To connect retailers with consumers, we provide mobility data like vehicle traffic and mobile device data. To describe consumer intent, we provide geolocated digital marketing data.   We believe that accurate capital allocation through reliable local market data is foundational to creating robust, healthy, and livable communities for all. We hope you and your clients find tremendous value in this service.  ## Features  Query data and GeoJSON geometries at these scales for any US latitude and longitude:  * Rings (0.5 km+) * Drive time (1-60 minutes) * Bike time (3-60 minutes) * Walk time (5-60 minutes) * Public transit time (5-60 minutes) * Administrative region (US, states, core-based statistical areas, counties, Census-designated places, Census tracts, zipcodes, Census block groups, opportunity zones)  | Data Feature | Description | | ------- | ------------------------------| | Demographics, Housing, Spending | *Updated Quarterly*.
