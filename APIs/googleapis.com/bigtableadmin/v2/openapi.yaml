If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be <, >, <=, >=, !=, =, or :. Colon ':' represents a HAS operator which is roughly synonymous with equality. Filter rules are case insensitive. The fields eligible for filtering are: * `name` * `source_table` * `state` * `start_time` (and values are of the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) * `end_time` (and values are of the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) * `expire_time` (and values are of the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) * `size_bytes` To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND, OR, and NOT expressions explicitly. Some examples of using filters are: * `name:\"exact\"` --> The backup's name is the string \"exact\". * `name:howl` --> The backup's name contains the string \"howl\". * `source_table:prod` --> The source_table's name contains the string \"prod\". * `state:CREATING` --> The backup is pending creation. * `state:READY` --> The backup is fully created and ready for use. * `(name:howl) AND (start_time < \\\"2018-03-28T14:50:00Z\\\")` --> The backup name contains the string \"howl\" and start_time of the backup is before 2018-03-28T14:50:00Z. * `size_bytes > 10000000000` --> The backup's size is greater than 10GB"

    Policy:
      description: "An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\", } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/)."

Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
