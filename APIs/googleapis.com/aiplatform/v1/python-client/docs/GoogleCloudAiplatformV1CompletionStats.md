**successful_count** | **str** | Output only. The number of entities that had been processed successfully. | [optional] [readonly] 
**successful_forecast_point_count** | **str** | Output only. The number of the successful forecast points that are generated by the forecasting model. This is ONLY used by the forecasting batch prediction. | [optional] [readonly] 

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.google_cloud_aiplatform_v1_completion_stats import GoogleCloudAiplatformV1CompletionStats

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of GoogleCloudAiplatformV1CompletionStats from a JSON string
google_cloud_aiplatform_v1_completion_stats_instance = GoogleCloudAiplatformV1CompletionStats.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(GoogleCloudAiplatformV1CompletionStats.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
google_cloud_aiplatform_v1_completion_stats_dict = google_cloud_aiplatform_v1_completion_stats_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of GoogleCloudAiplatformV1CompletionStats from a dict
google_cloud_aiplatform_v1_completion_stats_from_dict = GoogleCloudAiplatformV1CompletionStats.from_dict(google_cloud_aiplatform_v1_completion_stats_dict)
