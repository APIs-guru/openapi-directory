    Configuration for ConvexAutomatedStoppingSpec. When there are enough completed trials (configured by min_measurement_count), for pending trials with enough measurements and steps, the policy first computes an overestimate of the objective value at max_num_steps according to the slope of the incomplete objective value curve. No prediction can be made if the curve is completely flat. If the overestimation is worse than the best objective value of the completed trials, this pending trial will be early-stopped, but a last measurement will be added to the pending trial with max_num_steps and predicted objective value from the autoregression model.
