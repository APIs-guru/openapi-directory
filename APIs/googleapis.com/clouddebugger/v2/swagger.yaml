The breakpoint specification (location, condition, and expression fields) is semantically immutable, although the field values may change. For example, an agent may update the location line number to reflect the actual line the breakpoint was set to, but that doesn't change the breakpoint semantics. Thus, an agent does not need to check if a breakpoint has changed when it encounters the same breakpoint on a successive call. Moreover, an agent should remember breakpoints that are complete until the controller removes them from the active list to avoid setting those breakpoints again."
