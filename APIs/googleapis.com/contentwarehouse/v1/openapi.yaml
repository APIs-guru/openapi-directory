    AppsPeopleActivityBackendDestinationStream:
      description: "A DestinationStream is a /namespace/id[0]/id[1]/.../id[n] that represents a collection of Activities. Example destinations: -The Profile Stream on http://plus.google.com/+JohnDoe/posts -A Square Stream on http://plus.google.com/squares/123 -A \"comment Stream\" (Fountain) on http://www.youtube.com/watch?id=123 It's possible for a single Activity to show in each of these destinations - and it might behave/look slightly differently for each one. Destinations can have their own business logic associated with them at both write-time and read-time server-side (these are documented below). Each DestinationStream is indexed and can be retrieved using the GetDestinationStreamRequest. For the repeated ID space indexing happens at all levels, e.g. if you have: /square/123/abc /square/123/efd /square/456 You can fetch /square/123/abc directly or /square/123 (which includes all Activities in both /square/123/abc and /square/123/efd), or even /square which retrieves all Activities in the Square namespace (visible for that user). On the storage layer, we represent DestinationStream as Channel (http://cs/#google3/social/common/channel/channel.proto), since the storage does not have the concept of a Stream. Both terms are used interchangeably within the service layer, but client of Social Infrastructure should use the term DestinationStream. Next ID: 3"

For users that do have birthday data: - \"Profile Birthday\" (person.birthday.metadata.container is PROFILE) may not have a year set if user \"hides\" the year. - \"Account Birthday\" (see api-specific notes below) will only be returned for the requester's own profile. - People API (go/peopleapi): * Account birthday is only supported in GetPeople for PeopleAPI. * If account birthday is needed, use a request mask with: `include_field { paths: \"person.birthday\" }` `include_container: ACCOUNT` - People API++ (go/peopleapi++): * Account birthday is supported for most apis in PeopleAPI++. * If account birthday is needed, use a request mask with: `include_field { paths: \"person.account_birthday\" }` `include_container: PROFILE` (note: it will also need `include_container: DOMAIN_PROFILE` because they must be requested together: go/people-api-masks#profile-domain_profile) - See go/papi-vs-papi++#birthday for more details."

        calendarDay:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/GoogleTypeDate"
          description: Birthdays are more accurately represented as a calendar day that does not depend on a timestamp representation at all. When given a timestamp, there are lots of opportunities to make mistakes, so a CalendarDay proto is replacing timestamps. Currently this is always returned by PeopleApi on reads that include birthday fields. New clients should write using calendar_day. Clients that were already writing via date_ms are allowlisted such that writes use that field. Old callers should migrate to writing BOTH date_ms and calendar_day values. If those are consistent, they may be removed from the 'legacy_timestamp_event_write_behavior_enabled' capability.
        dateMs:
          description: Birthdays are currently represented as timestamp values, although the interpretation of these timestamp values is a calendar date. Clients are recommended to read the calendar_day field, which is easier to work with than date_ms. New clients writing to PeopleApi must set calendar_day instead of date_ms. There are a few important details about how this value should be mapped to a calendar date that should be consistent among all clients. 1. Epoch - The epoch or calendar date equivalent to 0 ms is chosen to be 1970-01-01 UTC. 2. Timezone - All of the conversions to calendars should occur in the UTC timezone. We don't typically think of someones birthday changing when they travel, so clients should not use local times. 3. Calendar - The calendar used for the dates should be a Gregorian proleptic calendar. Proleptic means that the rules of the Gregorian calendar are retrofitted to before its adoption. It is easy to get this wrong, particularly with the java GregorianCalendar class, which by default is a mixed Gregorian/Julian calendar. Joda Time makes this easy, but if it's not an option, look into GregorianCalendar.setGregorianChange(). 4. Omitted years - Clients have chosen to represent birthdays or events without years as timestamps within the year zero. When the computed date has a year of 0, it means the client did not specify a year. Note that a year 0 does not exist in a chronology like the familiar Anno Domini (A.D. and B.C.); clients must agree on year numbering. 5. Year Numbering - The chronology used to map dates to the calendar should use Astronomical Year Numbering so that the year 0 is defined and dates before it have a negative year. If libraries only provide Anno Domini, then the year of 1 BC corresponds to year zero and an omitted user provided year. Other BC values are presumed rare, but clients should still not ignore the era and interpret the year as an A.D. value, especially if writing values back to PeopleApi.

    AppsPeopleOzExternalMergedpeopleapiGender:
      description: 'Gender in PeopleApi has some odd semantics about writing and reading that are not obvious from the proto definition. First, the `type` string, when read, always maps to the constrained domain of "male", "female", and "other", aside from a pathological case that PeopleApi would like to fix. There are two typical patterns: 1. `type` is either "male" or "female" and `custom_type` and `address_me_as` are exactly as specified by an update to PeopleApi, although they are most often absent for "male" and "female" writes. 2. `type` is "other" and `custom_type` is set to a freeform string from the request. `address_me_as` is equal to whatever was provided at write time. When writing, the free-form string for `custom_type` can come from either `custom_type` if the field is present on the request, or if `custom_type` is absent, the string value of `type` will be copied into it. Any value in `type` will be coerced to "other" and the free-form value will be copied into `custom_type`, even if `type` is exactly "other". Prefer to explicitly set `custom_type` and set type to "other" instead of setting type to a free-form value. There are weird edge cases when the value is "unknown". Consider the behavior for `type` == "unknown" unspecified. Clients reading the gender should use the value from `formatted_type` if `type` is "male" or "female". If `type` is "other", `formatted_type` will be "Other" (or some translation) and clients should read `custom_type` for more specificity. '

For CONTACT mutates, (i.e. when Name.metadata.container is CONTACT), it is recommended for clients to set either the `unstructured_name` or the set of structured name fields, not both. * When only the `unstructured_name` is set, it is parsed to produce a best-guess set of structured name values for the `given_name`, `family_name`, etc. * When only the structured name fields are set, the various values are combined to produce an `unstructured_name`. * When both are set, the `unstructured_name` is saved as-is and the structured name fields are saved as-is. This may be confusing as they might not "match". For PROFILE mutates, (i.e. when Name.metadata.container is PROFILE), it is _required_ for clients to use the structured name fields as the unstructured field value is ignored on write. The unstructured name fields are generated for convenience on read. For DEVICE_CONTACTS, see b/156020778.

NOTE: when responding to the user, the Assistant may actually make use of other roles such as "ETA" or "driver" that are not part of the intent declaration. These should still be assigned consistent semantic roles. For example, a dialog with the Shopping feature: User: Where can I buy XYZ? Google: [Best Buy in Sunnyvale] has [XYZ] in stock. User: Great! Give me directions. In this case, both "Best Buy" and "XYZ" would be pushed to attentional entities.

Within the remaining documents, we say the image is "rejected". Note that this distinction is slightly different from selected for indexing. Only images within doc_images where is_indexed_by_imagesearch is true will be selected for indexing. You can find the rejected images at composite_doc.doc_attachments().get(). You can find images that are selected, but for which we have no ImageData (yet) at composite_doc.image_indexing_info().selected_not_indexed_image_link()

Applications must ensure that EventIdMessages have increasing times, artificially increasing time_usec to one greater than the previous value if necessary. Alternate implementations were considered: 1. storing unix time and microseconds separately would require a bit more storage, and the convenience of having a single value representing the time seemed more useful than having trivial access to a unix time. 2. storing unix time in the upper 32 bits would allow for more precision - up to 4G events/second, but it wouldn't print nicely as a decimal value and it seems unlikely that any single server would ever sustain more than 1M events/second. 3. Java-compatible time uses millis - this would limit servers to 1000 events per second - too small. Other names for this field were considered, including time, time_stamp, and utime. We felt that including the units in the name would tend to produce more readable code. utime might be interpreted as user time. unix timestamp * 1e6 + microseconds"

    GeostoreAccessPointProto:
      description: 'This class holds information about a single access point. An access point establishes a relationship between a feature (like a POI or building) and some other feature. For example, consider a TYPE_LOCALITY feature like Seattle. An access point might be the TYPE_AIRPORT feature for Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. The airport feature defines the access point to gain airplane-based access to Seattle. A feature like Seattle will typically have multiple access points. You can get to Seattle using airplanes, various forms of public transit, or by driving a car. Thus Seattle would have multiple access points. You may be able to get to Seattle by flying into SeaTac, or you might be able to fly into Boeing Field, or Paine Field in Everett. You could drive in from the North/South using I-5, or you could drive in from the East using I-90. Many access points are from the road network. Thus the access point for some building at 123 Main Street would likely be a segment that defines the 100-200 block of "Main Street". A feature at the corner of "Hollywood" and "Vine" streets might have access points from both named streets. Access points are an optional field. Data editors may ignore them when creating features or editing other fields. In these cases, other quality teams will synthesize and update them. Several fields are also optional, as they are derivable from other fields. Access points to non-TYPE_SEGMENT features should always have the following fields set: - feature_type - feature_id - point Location and reference fields: BASIC vs DERIVABLE Access points to TYPE_SEGMENT features must have all the following BASIC fields: - feature_type (of the segment, e.g. TYPE_ROAD or TYPE_VIRTUAL_SEGMENT) - point_off_segment (or point; see "fuzzy point" note below) - unsuitable_travel_mode (may be empty) - level (indoor access points only) The following are DERIVABLE fields, which should only be added if the supplier is confident about their accuracy: - feature_id - point_on_segment - segment_position Editing clients are encouraged to set all fields, but they may set only the BASIC fields, in which case quality teams may use the BASIC fields to snap to an appropriate segment and derive the remaining fields. Example: The segment is split, so that the portion that the access point is on has a new feature ID. Quality teams notice that the point_on_segment is no longer on the segment with feature_id, finds the new nearest segment based on feature_type and existing point_on_segment, and re-derives a new feature_id, point_on_segment, and segment_position, keeping other fields consistent. Fuzzy point special case If the editor does not have side-of-road information for access points or is otherwise unsure of the precise placement of the access point, it may supply the point field (and not point_off_segment) as basic data instead, in which case quality teams may generate the point_off_segment. Identity Access points are considered semantically equivalent if they have the same geometry, including derived fields, and the same references to other features (feature_id, level_feature_id). For the exact definition, see cs/symbol:geostore::AreAccessPointsEquivalent. Field definitions'

This offset is in a direction perpendicular to the direction of travel along the segment. The actual offset distance is unspecified. It would typically be relatively small (approximately 1 meter). You can subtract the "off segment" point from the "on segment" point to get a vector of unknown length pointing from "on segment" point to the "off segment" point. You can then scale that vector to whatever length you want. Note that extending this displacement vector a large distance (10s of meters) may result in a new point that is in the middle of some other feature (park, street, intersection). This is the preferred basic geometry field for incoming data from editing clients and importers, if side-of-road is well-established.

When an address is initially parsed via a feed or other raw input and structured as an AddressProto, parsed_name should contain the set of names that corresponds to the (possibly normalized) raw text from the raw input. 2. In MapFacts, the address component may be linked to an actual feature via feature_id. Any address formatting directly from MapFacts should follow links to retrieve names when possible. The parsed_name contents may be formatted directly if the address component is unlinked following the same rules as selecting and formatting the name of a feature. The cached parsed_name is regularly refreshed from the linked feature with the minimal set of names for address components (usually just a single, preferred name, in the local language, plus a Latin-script name: go/story-of-ac-names). 3. In serving systems, the names of linked features may be denormalized into the parsed_name field to facilitate quicker address formatting or for simple data filtering (e.g. finding all geocodes in California by name). If reading a feature from such a system, the parsed_name field could contain multiple names in multiple languages that reflect a cached copy of the names associated with the linked features. Formatting of such names should follow the same rules as selecting and formatting the name of a feature itself."

      description: "This class represents an address, partial address, or address range. It is intended to be attached to features to identify their address(es). Some important points about addresses: - The addresses in the Geo Schema do *not* include a component for the name of the feature, i.e. they are not self-referential. For example, the name of a feature might be \"Zack's Pizza\" and its address would be \"123 Main Street\". Similarly, streets, cities, and counties do not include themselves as part of their address. The address of \"Seattle\" is \"King County, Washington, USA\". If want to construct an address that *does* include the feature name, you can simply prepend it to the other address components. - Lakes, mountains, and other natural features do not normally have addresses. Countries also do not have addresses because they are at the top of the political hierarchy. - Address components in the Geo Schema are listed in a particular order, independent of the conventions used by the country in which they occur. The basic order is \"smallest to largest\" starting with street numbers and routes, then political features, and ending with postal features. The exact rules are defined by the implementation of the AddressComponentOrdering::IsLessThan() function. - Some types of address components may occur more than once in an address. For example, a UK address with a \"dependent thoroughfare\" would have two components of TYPE_ROUTE (i.e. street names). These are listed in the order they are normally written."

See go/address-lines-multi-language for information about why we made this change. If any components are filled in, this is supplemental to (i.e. disjoint from) them. Furthermore, this must be the most specific portion of the address (except for the portion, if any, stored in the name field of feature.proto). Unparsed lines are always formatted together in a block. Other address components are never formatted between the address lines. This doesn't imply that the address lines are always either the first or the last part of the formatted output.

We have future plans to make other changes so we can handle this case. Example #2: Single semi-numeric address (e.g., "12bis") The number array contains two copies of the single numeric value (12). The prefix is empty and the suffix contains "bis". The parameter array has two identical values specifying the position of the single address. Example #3: Simple address range (e.g., "100 to 198, even numbers only") The number array contains the two values "100" and "198". The prefix and suffix strings are empty in this example. The parameter array has two values, one for each number. The same_parity flag is set in this example.'

    GeostoreBorderProto:

Borders are only used for features that tile an area. For example, country features have borders with one another because they tile an area of land. Country features do not have borders with province features because those two types of features may intersect with each other. The geometry of a border will often be similar (or derived from) the geometry of the two features that it separates. However, it is useful to have borders represented by stand-alone features for map-styling purposes. Ideally, the geometry in a border feature would be exactly the same as the common edges of the polygonal geometry of the two features. This may not always be true in practice. At some point in the future we would like to build a network of borders for features that are supposed to tile with each other. The network would be composed of different border types meeting at endpoint intersections. In the process of building this network, we would perform small geometry corrections to ensure that the borders align properly at all zoom levels. Border features are intended primarily for map drawing, and they would rarely be useful for geocoding. One exception would be for famous borders like the "Mason Dixon Line" or the "Berlin Wall." The standard feature properties have the following interpretations: name - Borders rarely have names unless they notable in their own right (e.g. "Mason Dixon Line", "Berlin Wall"). point - A border should not have point geometry. polyline - A border should have a single polyline that represents the division between the two features. polygon - A border should not have polygon geometry.'

It is more likely that the precision of a date will be inferred from the date format. For example "19th century" is likely to be correct to the century, while "1800" is probably correct to the year. The precision should be semantically interpreted as a cast, so a DateTimeProto object with a seconds value corresponding to 2018-03-28 18:40:00 UTC and a precision of MONTH should be interpreted as "March 2018". The enums above are only some of the possible precision levels for dates and times. Clients may wish to add more precision enums in the future. However, these enums must be ordered by decreasing duration. Clients should be able to write date formatting code that looks like this: if (datetime.precision() <= DateTimeProto::PRECISION_CENTURY) { date = FormatCenturyDate(proto.seconds()); } else if (proto.precision() <= case DateTimeProto::PRECISION_DECADE) { date = FormatDecadeDate(proto.seconds()); } else { ... } See geostore/base/public/datetime.h for date formatting utility functions.'

    GeostoreFeatureIdProto:
      description: A globally unique identifier associated with each feature. We use 128-bit identifiers so that we have lots of bits available to distinguish between features. The feature id currently consists of a 64-bit "cell id" that **sometimes** corresponds to the approximate centroid of the feature, plus a 64-bit fingerprint of other identifying information. See more on each respective field in its comments. Feature ids are first assigned when the data is created in MapFacts. After initial creation of the feature, they are immutable. This means that the only properties that you should rely on are that they are unique, and that cell_ids often - but not always - preserve spatial locality. The degree of locality varies as the feature undergoes geometry changes, and should not in general be considered a firm guarantee of the location of any particular feature. In fact, some locationless features have randomized cell IDs! Consumers of FeatureProtos from Mapfacts are guaranteed that fprints in the id field of features will be globally unique. Using the fprint allows consumers who don't need the spatial benefit of cell ids to uniquely identify features in a 64-bit address space. This property is not guaranteed for other sources of FeatureProtos.
      properties:
        cellId:
          description: "The S2CellId corresponding to the approximate location of this feature as of when it was first created. This can be of variable accuracy, ranging from the exact centroid of the feature at creation, a very large S2 Cell, or even being completely randomized for locationless features. Cell ids have the nice property that they follow a space-filling curve over the surface of the earth. (See s2cellid.h for details.) WARNING: Clients should only use cell IDs to perform spatial locality optimizations. There is no strict guarantee that the cell ID of a feature is related to the current geometry of the feature in any way."

        fprint:

If creating new fprints, the strategy should be chosen so that the chance of collision is remote or non-existent, and the distribution should be reasonably uniform. For example, if the source data assigns unique ids to features, then a fingerprint of the provider name, version, and source id is sufficient.

          description: "Address for this feature. A Geo Schema address is designed to model a mailing address, so only features that have mailing addresses in the real world may have addresses. Each feature should have only one address. If you want to describe the geographic location of a feature which does not have a mailing address with respect to other well-known features, some other schema constructs should be used. Note that the field is defined as repeated though features that use this field with its intended semantics are constrained to have a single address even if they may have multiple mailing addresses in the real world. The “single address” rule is enforced by lint. Current exceptions to the single address rule and mailing address rule are described in the g3doc. Bear note that the schema team is actively working on eliminating these exceptions. http://go/geo-addresses Note the following conventions: - Addresses follow the postal hierarchy, not the political hierarchy. Addresses may have components that refer to political entities when those entities also appear in the postal hierarchy. - As stated previously, but it bears repeating, addresses on features are mailing addresses. In many cases the physical address and the mailing address are the same but the address stored on a feature represents the mailing address of the feature. An example of a non-physical mailing address would be a PO Box. - These addresses are commonly defined and verifiable by a governmental authority (e.g. the United States Postal Service in the United States, Royal Mail in the United Kingdom, Correios in Brazil, etc.) and should follow conventions and rules defined by those authorities."

          description: A latitude-longitude rectangle used by bucketing MapReduces. See the documentation on bucketing MapReduce for details. This field can be a source of confusion. Because it is called "bound", it is often assumed that it is a tight bound on the geometry but it can be (and often is) much larger. If a tight bound is needed then use the standard GetFeatureGeometryBound() function instead. To be more explicit, if you are using this field for *anything* else than a bucketing MapReduce, you are doing the wrong thing. Not all features are required to have bounding boxes. See geostore::IsBoundRequiredForFeatureType() for the list of feature types required to have a bounding box. This bound field will be updated when a feature changes in MapFacts to include its geometry. Also, a GeoSchema pipeline, go/geo-schema-pipelines-docs#expand-bounds runs periodically to update the field for strong references from other features. Therefore, most editors don't need to edit this field explicitly. See go/geo-changes:no-edit-for-feature-bound for the details.

          description: The conceptual center of the feature, used for routing. For cities, this would be the center of the downtown, or maybe the location of city hall. For states and countries it might be the capital city. Most feature types will not have a conceptual center - by default, routing will use the centroid of the feature's geometry. If you need a feature center point consider using GetFeatureGeometryCenter() function from geostore/base/public/feature.h rather than reading from this field directly.
        child:
          description: Features can define themselves as a collection of other features. For example, a route is a collection of road segments, and a feature for the "Great Lakes" could be defined as lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario. It is not recommended to design a multi level tree using the child field to build up a feature because it requires fetching many features to see the details of the feature. In practice this is used to model archipelago, route, transit (agencies, lines, trips, departures), and river features. The geometry of a feature is implicitly defined by its children, so if a feature has children then it should not have any points, polylines, or polygons. In general, this field should not be used to represent political or postal hierarchies. For example, a county would not list its cities as children, because the county is not defined in terms of its cities (it also contains unincorporated areas, etc.).

Not all properties that exist in the KG schema can be asserted via this mechanism. The set of properties that are allowed to be set on a feature depends on the feature's GConcepts (and feature type). For instance, only gcid:country features may have the /geo/type/country/president property (made up example, since that property doesn't actually exist in the KG schema). GConcept hierarchy is taken into account for deciding the set of allowed properties. Additionally, the specific properties allowed are further constrained by the list specified at go/kg-property-allowlist. NOTE: not all types of properties are allowed to appear in the Geo Schema. For now, we limit ourselves to properties whose value type is TYPE_BOOL, TYPE_COMPOUND, TYPE_DATETIME, TYPE_FLOAT, TYPE_ID, TYPE_INT, TYPE_NESTED_STRUCT, TYPE_TEXT, or TYPE_URI. NOTE(b/35039936): We are in the process of changing how a KG property with multiple values is stored in this field. Currently, such a KG property is stored in a single instance of the kg_property field. However, we will be changing this so that each value will be stored in its own instance of kg_property. Any client that wants to read from this field should be prepared to read data represented in either format. See b/35039936 or the announcement at http://g/geo-schema-announce/7IXR3Fex8to/7yFyT5UoAwAJ for an example and more details. The mechanism to assert that a KG property has no value is via the property_value_status field below. freebase.PropertyValue.value_status is not allowed be set here for consistency reason."

Geometry may be synthesized if none is available (e.g., polygons for postal codes). The synthetic_geometry flag should be set in that case. Point is currently enforced as a non-repeating field for all feature types, though it is defined as repeating in case future modeling requires multiple points. The number of allowed polylines, tracks, or polygons vary based on feature type. A feature can have at most one pose (it is an optional field).

    GeostoreGradeLevelProto:

For example, you might have a freeway at level = 0 and an overpass at level = 2. Vertical segments are represented by a polyline containing only 1 vertex and exactly two grade_level in segment.proto whose indices are 0. grade_level(0) represents the relative height at the start point of the segments, and grade_level(1) represents the one at the end point.
      properties:
        index:
          description: The index of the point along the segment, where 0 is the starting point. This means that the index of a point along a segment and its sibling will be different.

        level:
          description: The grade level of the indexed point. The grade level can be thought of as a relative vertical ordering with respect to other segments at the same point, where larger/more positive numbers are "higher". Negative grade level values are allowed and are typically used for points below grade level (0 is a common choice to represent the level of points at the ground level). For vertical segments, the height, i.e. the vertical length, is represented by difference of levels in millimeters. For example, feature.segment().grade_level(0).level() == 0 and feature.segment().grade_level(1).level() == 5000, then the length of the vertical segment feature is 5000 millimeters (5 meters).

      description: "Our TYPE_INTERSECTION features model the point where one or more segments terminate. This is topological definition: it may not match what a typical user would think of as an \"intersection\". Consider the intersections where Hayes, Market, Larkin, and 9th Street meet near (37.77765, -122.41638) in San Francisco. Most people would probably consider this a single feature, even though we model it as four separate TYPE_INTERSECTION features. The TYPE_INTERSECTION_GROUP is used to model the user's concept of a real-world intersection, which also includes turn lanes or a whole roundabout (a logical intersection). For the purposes of modeling turn restrictions and lane connections, a smaller grouping is needed to model the \"core\" part of the intersection where there are no lane markings. This is called a core or artifact group. An intersection group must contain at least two intersections or add some information (e.g. a name or a polygon) compared to the intersection itself, or else must not exist. The standard feature properties are interpreted as follows: name - Can be used to specify any \"special\" names associated with this intersection (e.g. Reads Corner intersection, PEI, Canada). Intersections that are named according to their cross streets do not need to specify this field, since this can be determined by looking at the routes associated with each segment. address - This should always be empty. point - Specifies the center of the intersection. This is basically the point where the intersection name should be rendered. Can be omitted in favor of a polygon. polyline - This should always be empty. polygon - Specifies the two-dimensional extent of the intersection. This may substitute to the point field, though having a center set is desirable in this case. child - This should always be empty."

The standard feature properties are interpreted as follows: name - This should always be empty. Intersections that have a "special" name (e.g. Reads Corner intersection, PEI, Canada) should point to a separate TYPE_INTERSECTION_GROUP feature that captures it.

    GeostoreLaneProto:
      description: "Describes an individual road lane. Not only driving lanes, but also parking and biking lanes are covered by this. Note that we may eventually add curbs and walking to this schema. MOTIVATION/DESIGN DISCUSSION The intent of this schema is to model a schematic representation of the road for a bunch of use cases within GMM, navigation, map tiles. For rendering, we do not want to represent the geometry of each lane exactly, but do want to model types/width/gaps/lane markings so that a schematic rendering can be made. For navigation, we model lane connectivity and restrictions per lane, so that Pathfinder can potentially pick routes based on lanes, and definitely use the lanes to better describe the path to the driver. This schema is driven by the GT team, which is likely to be the only provider of this data. It is based on compromises that we are working out with other teams, based on what our operators can reasonably collect and what is useful. See docs here: https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/11XJ1WvqS5Sm7MxWXzzc3tnsk49VhrR3BYFjiRMAzYm0/edit?hl=en_US https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/1nzdupynTUKE8xY8JcfvQbU-KWtCJ6IwHiTaCxuq40EM/edit?hl=en_US Note: Some lane information (width, surface type, etc) may duplicate or contradict information stored at the segment level."

For instance, this can happen with timed or vehicle type based restrictions on the segment. If lane connectivity implies a segment-level restriction (can't transition to some target segment), that restriction will also exist as a segment level restriction. In effect - PathFinder does not have to look at lane connectivity to figure out segment connectivity. Example: Typically, lanes are just connected to one other lane. Example: A splitting lane is connected to the two resulting lanes. Example: At an intersection, a lane is connected to crossing lanes according to how lanes are painted across the intersection. In the common case, the target segment will be connected to the same intersection as this segment. That will however NOT be true for complex intersections where there is an intersection group. The connections will be across the whole group, connecting to one of the outgoing segments from the group. This is analogous to how we do turn restrictions around intersection groups."

For features with very complex polygonal geometry, we break up the polygon into pieces that align with S2 cells at various levels. We do this for performance reasons as some geometry operations have quadratic complexity with regards to the total number of vertices. In these cases, we store the S2 cell ID corresponding to the piece of the overall polygon that is described by this specific PolygonProto message. Each polygon piece is expected to be fully contained by the S2 cell corresponding to this cell ID. However, note that the S2 cell ID is not required to correspond to the smallest S2 cell that fully contains the polygon (and often won't be). In addition, polygon pieces are required to not have any overlap (which translates to having entirely disjoint S2 cell IDs, i.e. one can not be parent (or grand parent, etc.) of another)."

This is an orthogonal concept to FeatureProto.synthetic_geometry, which only pertains to the method by which a polygon was created, rather than its fidelity to ground truth. For features that have multiple polygons, this bit should be consistently set to the same value on all polygons.

        rank:
          description: A value in the range [0, 1] estimating Oyster Rank according to this signal. Non-provider specific signals (e.g. SIGNAL_POPULATION) are interpreted by some common code in the ranking pipeline. Because of that, data providers should leave this field empty when setting such signals (so that the rank assignment can be uniform across all features regardless of contributing data providers). On the other hand, provider-specific signals (e.g. SIGNAL_ZENRIN_CITY_CATEGORY) are required to specify the rank field (it is not optional for them). That is because no code other than that of the provider itself will be able to fill in a meaningful value later on. We don't want clients to be reading from the raw_scalar / raw_string fields to interpret the data.

If both of these conditions apply, the restriction is true, and the turn is prohibited. Multiple restrictions may apply to the same action. Clients handle this by always declaring RestrictionProto as a "repeated" element. The semantics of having multiple restrictions are that if any restriction applies, then the action cannot be taken. In other words, restrictions are OR-ed together. Putting all of this together, a set of RestrictionProtos can be interpreted as an bool expression in disjunctive normal form: (A and B) or (D and E and F) or (G and H) The action is prohibited if this expression is true. Note that a restriction with no conditions is always true, i.e. its action is always prohibited.'

Segments that are referenced by this subpath field also refer to this feature back via the same subpath field. For all styles of restriction, all segments in the subpath must have identical copies of the restriction. In other words, restrictions are duplicated along every segment in the subpath. Note that subpaths of length 1 do not have any purpose and are disallowed. Note that it is possible to represent restrictions either using STYLE_CONTIGUOUS, or depending on the length of the subpath, one of the more specific STYLE_SINGLE, STYLE_TURN, or STYLE_IN_OUT. New code should use the more specific alternatives if possible, as they support instant updates. For restriction_style == STYLE_CONTIGUOUS (the default): "subpath" can either be empty, for a single-segment restriction, or it specifies exactly the sequence of segments which this restriction applies to. The subpath may be used to specify a turn restriction (a subpath of length 2) or to prohibit more complex maneuvers. For example, when merging onto a road from the right-hand side it may not be possible to make an immediate left turn due to insufficient time to cross the intervening lanes or the presence of a physical barrier. This would be indicated by a subpath restriction of length 3 or more. For restriction_style == STYLE_SINGLE: The subpath field of the Restriction must be empty. The restriction applies only to the segment it is attached to. There must not be an intersection group specified. For restriction_style == STYLE_TURN: The subpath field of the Restriction must contain exactly two segments. The first is called the "in_segment", the second is the "out_segment". They must be contiguous, i.e. the end intersection of the in_segment is the start intersection of the out_segment. The restriction applies only to a direct maneuver from the in_segment to the out_segment. Other paths from the in_segment to the out_segment are not restricted. There must not be an intersection group specified. For restriction_style == STYLE_IN_OUT: The subpath field of the Restriction must contain exactly two segments. The first is called the "in_segment", the second is the "out_segment". Note that the two segments define paths, but may not actually be one. The end intersection of the in_segment must be in an intersection group which also contains the start intersection of the out_segment. The in- and out-segments are not required to be adjacent, but may be. Either way, the restriction applies to any path from the in_segment to the out_segment through the intersection group, not just direct turns. The intersection_group must be specified. Note that clients which read restrictions and need to know which paths are restricted by a given IN_OUT restriction must expand the IN_OUT restriction by finding all paths through the intersection group from the in_segment to the out_segment.'

Pathfinder currently (last updated August 2013) has heuristics to cope with incomplete data that reduce or extend application of the specified restrictions to pedestrians or bicycles. We are actively working to remove these heuristics and replace them with explicit, correct travel modes in the data. See b/8746491."

Restrictions may make a single segment, turn, or more complex maneuver along a set of segments unroutable for the specified travel modes, or may only add penalties or warnings, depending on the restriction type. Turn restrictions are one example of a restriction. By default, turns are allowed onto all outgoing segments from this segment's intersection (including the sibling of this segment, i.e. U-turns are allowed by default). If any of these turns are disallowed they will be listed as "subpath restrictions". A subpath restriction disallows travel on given sequence of segments. In the case of a disallowed turn, the subpath simply consists of the source and destination feature ids. There may also be restrictions that apply to all travel on this segment (e.g. chains required, or closed in winter), or restrictions that just apply to certain lanes (e.g. high occupancy vehicle lanes).

The absence of fields larger than any specified field indicates repetition (e.g. no year indicates that the interval occurs every year). The absence of units that are "smaller" than the largest specified unit indicates a default lowest value (no hour means midnight (0)). When intersecting time intervals, "smaller" units repeat within the "larger" unit as many times as necessary. For example, the intersection of the interval from hour 0 to hour 24 with the interval from second 0 to second 1 is equivalent to the union of the set of intervals which represents the first second of every minute of every hour of every day. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- WARNING - if you add new fields to TimeEndpointProto you need to: - ensure AreTimeEndpointsEquivalent considers the new fields (and update the corresponding tests) -----------------------------------------------------------------------------'

          description: 'Flow identifies a single sequential unit of text (or other content). It is only set on Blocks -- a flow identifies a sequence of Blocks. The default, main flow is just the empty string. The "FlowThread" of a block is the flow (if non-empty), suffixed with the block appearance. This is computed by GoodocUtils::FlowThread(). Paragraphs may be split over blocks in the same FlowThread, across pages. The following table shows how FlowThread gets computed: ## Flow Appearance FlowThread (empty) UNSPECIFIED "UNSPECIFIED" foo BODY "foo:BODY" Please use lower-case strings for flows (such as article-33-box). One useful way to think of flows is this: A logical unit of interest in a a Document (for example, an article) would be identified by a starting block, an ending block, and a list of flows of interest within the [start, end) span. message Article { (page#, block#): article_start; (page#, block#): article_end; repeated string flows; } The reading order of blocks, paragraphs/etc within this article would be the same order as present in the goodoc itself. Some applications (such as rendering) may want to process the article by running over all the flows together, others (such as indexing) may want to deal with the FlowThreads one after the other.'

Note(viresh): I experimented with this compression, and here are some numbers for reference. If the zlib-compressed page goodoc string size was 100 to start with, then this compaction makes it 65. As a possible future relaxation to consider: if we add in, for each symbol, a \"top\" and \"bottom\" box offset then the size would be 75 (that's with \"repeated int32 top/bottom_offset\" fields inside BoxPartitions, instead of inside each symbol)."

Supported operators are: `=`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, and `~~` where the left of the operator is a property name and the right of the operator is a number or a quoted string. You must escape backslash (\\) and quote (\") characters. `~~` is the LIKE operator. The right of the operator must be a string. The only supported property data type for LIKE is text_values. It provides semantic search functionality by parsing, stemming and doing synonyms expansion against the input query. It matches if the property contains semantic similar content to the query. It is not regex matching or wildcard matching. For example, "property.company ~~ \"google\"" will match records whose property `property.compnay` have values like "Google Inc.", "Google LLC" or "Google Company". Supported functions are `LOWER([property_name])` to perform a case insensitive match and `EMPTY([property_name])` to filter on the existence of a key. Boolean expressions (AND/OR/NOT) are supported up to 3 levels of nesting (for example, "((A AND B AND C) OR NOT D) AND E"), a maximum of 100 comparisons or functions are allowed in the expression. The expression must be < 6000 bytes in length. Only properties that are marked filterable are allowed (PropertyDefinition.is_filterable). Property names do not need to be prefixed by the document schema id (as is the case with histograms), however property names will need to be prefixed by its parent hierarchy, if any. For example: top_property_name.sub_property_name. Sample Query: `(LOWER(driving_license)="class \"a\"" OR EMPTY(driving_license)) AND driving_years > 10` CMEK compliant deployment only supports: * Operators: `=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`. * Boolean expressions: AND and OR.'

Data types: * Histogram facet (aka filterable properties): Facet names with format <schema id>.<facet>. Facets will have the format of: `a-zA-Z`. If the facet is a child facet, then the parent hierarchy needs to be specified separated by dots in the prefix after the schema id. Thus, the format for a multi- level facet is: <schema id>.<parent facet name>. <child facet name>. Example: schema123.root_parent_facet.middle_facet.child_facet * DocumentSchemaId: (with no schema id prefix) to get histograms for each document type (returns the schema id path, e.g. projects/12345/locations/us-west/documentSchemas/abc123). Example expression: * Document type counts: count('DocumentSchemaId') * For schema id, abc123, get the counts for MORTGAGE_TYPE: count('abc123.MORTGAGE_TYPE')"

A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\", } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/)."

Each range represents what should be displayed in the UI during this time range. The time range might be different from the actual time range of the underlying status. For example, if the user is OOO from 09:00 to 10:00, and a request is made at 8:00, the response might contain two intervals: [08:00, 09:00) - \"User is INACTIVE, but leaving the office soon\" [09:00, 10:00) - \"User is OOO till 10:00\" For intervals that don't have a clear availability signal coming from Calendar (e.g. OOO), we return INACTIVE.

Below there is an example response from the server. Let's assume the client calls the service at 17:59:45. The client receives the message and, assuming its current time is between [17:59:45, 18:00:00), it displays \"inactive\". When the current time becomes 18:00:00 it displays \"outside working hours\". At 18:00:40 the client issues another rpc which will return the availabilities for the next minute. The original response looks like availabilities { time_range { start_time: 17:59:45 end_time: 18:00:00 } status { inactive {} } } availabilities { time_range { start_time: 18:00:00 end_time: 18:00:45 } status { outside_working_hours { } } } next_poll_time: 18:00:40"

    GoogleTypeColor:
      description: "Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor's `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn't carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&red green:&green blue:&blue alpha:&alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha <= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!('alpha' in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(','); return ['rgba(', rgbParams, ',', alphaFrac, ')'].join(''); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red << 16) | (green << 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = ['#']; for (var i = 0; i < missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push('0'); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(''); }; // ..."

The date is relative to the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar. If year, month, or day are 0, the DateTime is considered not to have a specific year, month, or day respectively. This type may also be used to represent a physical time if all the date and time fields are set and either case of the `time_offset` oneof is set.

In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used.

Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. "Austin, TX"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be "envelope order" for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. "ja" for large-to-small ordering and "ja-Latn" or "en" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

        italianLeadingZero:
          description: In some countries, the national (significant) number starts with one or more "0"s without this being a national prefix or trunk code of some kind. For example, the leading zero in the national (significant) number of an Italian phone number indicates the number is a fixed-line number. There have been plans to migrate fixed-line numbers to start with the digit two since December 2000, but it has not happened yet. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%2B39 for more details. These fields can be safely ignored (there is no need to set them) for most countries. Some limited number of countries behave like Italy - for these cases, if the leading zero(s) of a number would be retained even when dialling internationally, set this flag to true, and also set the number of leading zeros. Clients who use the parsing or conversion functionality of the i18n phone number libraries (go/phonenumbers) will have these fields set if necessary automatically.

        nationalNumber:
          description: 'The National (significant) Number, as defined in International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Recommendation E.164, without any leading zero. The leading-zero is stored separately if required, since this is an uint64 and hence cannot store such information. Do not use this field directly: if you want the national significant number, call the getNationalSignificantNumber method of PhoneNumberUtil. For countries which have the concept of an "area code" or "national destination code", this is included in the National (significant) Number. Although the ITU says the maximum length should be 15, we have found longer numbers in some countries e.g. Germany. Note that the National (significant) Number does not contain the National (trunk) prefix. Obviously, as a uint64, it will never contain any formatting (hyphens, spaces, parentheses), nor any alphanumeric spellings.'

For example, in Columbia, a "3" needs to be dialed before the phone number itself when calling from a mobile phone to a domestic landline phone and vice versa. Note this is the "preferred" code, which means other codes may work as well.

      description: DataVersion tracks the version of data in CompositeDoc. The notion of "data" here is loose and people can define the name of their own. For example, a signal generated by Index Signals or an annotation generated by Goldmine (and other components) can all be considered as data here. Each field in this proto represents the human readable version string and the timestamp of one particular data. We choose to explicitly list out all of the data here for better understanding about which data are tracked. NOTE that human_readable_version is not intended for comparison, use timestamp_micros. In addition, we have an annotation about the field paths of each data. With proto reflection (using google3/net/proto2/util/public/field_path.h), downstream systems can take advantage of this annotation to automatically handle newly introduced data without modifying their code. Please also see the comment of FieldProjector above. There are also some fields in DataInfo that annotate who generates the data, the Index Signals or Goldmine annotator name.

Also see the file doc of RunningMeanAndVarianceUtil for a specification and more info about the algorithm. Notation: The data set is X = {(x_1, w_1), ..., (x_n, w_n)}. It consists of n weighted data points. The ith data point has value x_i and weight w_i. REQUIRES: x_i is finite for each i. w_i is finite for each i. w_i >= 0 for each i."

The ngram for this token would be \"present\" and the string \"current\" would be stored in synonym_ngram. Example 2: [nys important cities] We can generate interpretation kc:/location/us_state:cities by converting \"important\" to its synonym \"major\" or its synonym \"biggest\", because both \"major cities\" and \"biggest cities\" are attribute phrases for the intent. In this case, the ngram in this Token is \"important cities\", and the token_synonyms (specifically, the synonym_ngram field) would store \"major cities\" and \"biggest cities\", since those are the actual synonym ngrams that match the attribute phrases. For context phrases, we generally should have only one matched_squery_synonyms, since we try to find the best synonyms to use using the context phrase score.

An OpaqueType configures a value whose type is only interpretable by _specific_ clients of the intent catalog. This means horizontal 'features' like pretty printing, correct logging, intent blacklisting and signal aggregation will not work for opaque value types. It has a field for each type in IntentQuery that is not covered by a non-opaque type (specifically: protocol messages). The fields are themselves messages declared in this file. The specific opaque value types must be empty messages. If you find a need to add any fields to these messages, make them non-opaque and implement all of the code to treat them as first class types.

In principle fulfillment services (e.g., Monastery) should only dispatch such intents to multi-account approved fulfillers (schemas), at least when the user has a linked dasher account. The Assistant runtime policy engine should treat a query as dasher data if 1) this bit is true in the string redaction, and 2) the user has a linked dasher account, and apply a more restrictive rule for whitelisting, regardless of the actual account provenance in Sensitivity. Example: [User logged in to their personal gmail account.] Q1: \"Schedule a meeting tiltled okr review at 3pm\". Assistant: \"Should I scheduled it on your xyz@gmail.com account?\" Q2: \"No, add it to my xyz@bigcorp.com account.\" We don't know Q1 is dasher data until Q2. To prevent leaking of Q1 to non-dasher approved binaries, this bit should be used as a proactive measure. It might introduce some over-triggering (e.g., user says \"Yes\" in Q2), but is much better than blindly treating every query as dasher, not considering whether it actually triggers any multi-account capable intents or not (see b/164420114 for example)."

Query and intent could have data from multiple accounts, so this field is repeated. A sensitive knowledge_context.PreviousQuery might be dropped to prevent leaking cross-account data via Genie rewrite. For arguments, the best practice is to not blend multi-account data, and this field should be treated as singular to make ownership clear. When publishing attentional entities, contextual NLU might drop an argument that contains data from a different account for data protection. Mixing multi-account data in one argument will cause data from the primary account to be dropped altogether, which is an unnecessary quality loss.

A query matches a pattern if all the entities marked as T (== required) are found by QRef. If QRef also finds entities marked as star (== optional), those entities will be consumed in the LRS interpretation and added to the `QueryToLrsInterpretation.consumed_qref_mids` field. A query matches an entry if either: - QRef found the LRS entity itself in the query. This is the best-case scenario, it happens when the name of the event is well defined (for example "brexit") and the query mentions it explicitly; - the query matches any of the patterns defined in the entry.

Similarly, ordinal=0 represents a reference to the "current instance", which may vary depending on the target. E.g. "this week" is simply defined as the week range that contains the current reference time point, but "this " can be ambiguous and its resolution will depend on language/locale conventions ("this monday" in some languages refers to the closest upcoming instance of Monday, while in other languages it represents the Monday instance within the current week).

Semantics are partially expressed when later, unprompted user input is expected to modify the semantics.

These inputs can trigger modifications including adding arguments, changing the intent, or modifying existing arguments. Sensing this status can be done both directly and indirectly. Fluid Actions directly detects this status as the user moves between, or enters and leaves, argument form fields. Understanding indirectly detects this status by the pace of the user's speech, the semantics of the language, and the user's intonation. See go/streaming-nlu-fulfilment-protocol-v1 for details about how it is used in the Streaming NLU Fulfillment protocol.

There isn't a very reliable division between intercity rail and commuter rail -- Amtrak, LIRR, PATH, and NJ Transit are all classified as HEAVY_RAIL. That's why in these types we make a distinction between train and subway, and not train and muni_rail, (unlike TransitMode in the TravelAction proto).

It is possible that the annotator is absolutely sure that an entity is mentioned in a given range in the document, but this entity may be unrelated to the overall topic of the page (e.g. the entity "RSS" is mentioned in the footer of appleinsider.com). In this case the mention has a very high confidence score, but very low topicality score.

      description: "Metadata about a name. There are two metadata protos, whose content is meant to be similar but their usage different: NameEntityMetadata for readability and ConceptNameMetadata for size / decoding speed. NameEntityMetadata is propagated to GlobalNameInfo and EntityJoin tables, while ConceptNameMetadata is propagated from EntityJoins to the name matching tables and later to the Webref's/QRef's output. To add a new metadata field in the Names pipeline, and propagate it to EntityJoins and Names matching tables, it is necessary to: (1) Add the field to NameEntityMetadata, and a corresponding data representation in ConceptNameMetadata. (2) Populate the field in NameVariantSignals.name_metadata, from any source. This can be done in a corresponding NameProcessor. (3) Update the library name-metadata.h/cc to make sure that the metadata field is: a) merged correctly when merging two NameSignals; and b) transformed to the corresponding field in ConceptNameMetadata proto.

    RepositoryWebrefSimplifiedAnchor:
      description: Represents a subpart of the anchor data of the docjoins, but is much smaller. When we build this SimplifiedAnchor from the anchor data of the docjoins, by specifying the option separate_onsite_anchors to SimplifiedAnchorsBuilder, we can also separate the onsite anchors from the other (offdomain) anchors. So onsite anchors and offdomain anchors will have their own count, score, normalized score, and total volume (.._offdomain and .._onsite fields). For example, if there are 10 onsite anchors and 20 offdomain anchors for the anchor text "mountain view", then the count_from_onsite is 10, and the count_from_offdomain is 20 when we separate onsite anchors out. Otherwise (if we don't separate onsite anchors), the count is 30 (10 + 20) and we don't have values in the .._offdomain and .._onsite fields.

      description: 'Each SupportTransferRule proto represents a single STBR (go/stbr) rule. These rules are attached to entities (called STBR sources).

If an STBR source gets annotated, its attached rules result in creation of annotations for corresponding STBR targets. An STBR source might have more than one STBR rule attached to it. STBR rules allow us to address cases where otherwise annotations for what people say do not match what people mean. For example, a query [france vs spain] uses names of countries while in sports context the query would actually be about national sports teams of those countries. In other words, STBR rules have meaning of "in this particular context (see domain + target_collection fields below) a mention of this particular STBR source (the entity this rule is attached to) actually should be treated as that STBR target (see the target field below)". To describe the meaning of STBR settings (proto fields below), we are going to use a hypothetical example of an STBR rule making Search stack treat annotations for /m/France as annotations for /m/Louis_XIV, since he was the one saying "I am the state". In this example /m/France is going to be the STBR source.

If the domain is set to anything other than "default", the STBR rule is only going to result in an annotation for the STBR target inside of the Aqua domain of the corresponding name. If there is no such Aqua domain, the rule is going to be ignored. The default value of string "default" for domain makes it possible for the STBR rule to be used inside Loose Parser.

        isReverseLink:
          description: Whether this rule points from an STBR target to its STBR source. This field is an internal implementation detail that is not configurable by customers. Inside QRewrite we have to keep track of relations between entities. Among other things it is useful to remember which STBR target a given STBR source came from. For that purpose we attach an STBR proto to the STBR target, reversing the rule, i.e, putting STBR source's mid as the target etc. For this reversed rule we set is_reverse_link to true.
          type: boolean
        mentionsOnly:
          description: "STBR doesn't just create annotations for STBR targets. It also can modify search result support (useful in PostRef) in order for web pages supporting the STBR source to also support the STBR target. Otherwise in PostRef annotations for STBR targets are going to be demoted, resulting in the STBR rule potentially not affecting anything. Regarding treatment of this result support, STBR has 3 possible modes that for historical reasons are represented as 2 booleans - mentions_only and support_share. No more than one of these bools is supposed to be set to 'true' for a rule. Setting both to 'true' at once would lead to undefined behaviour. These 3 modes are: 1. (default) All the support gets assigned to the STBR target. The STBR source is left with no support. To be extra sure, interpretations that still managed to get triggered by STBR source are suppressed later unless STBR target has no interpretations of its own. In other words this is \"we are pretty sure that if France is mentioned in a query that might be talking about a person, we want to treat the query as if it is about Louis XIV\". This mode would result in a query [age of france] being treated as [age of louis xiv], while [population of france] still being about the country unless [population of louis xiv] matches some intents. For this mode both mentions_only and support_share should be set to 'false'. 2. Support is shared between STBR source ans STBR target. That allows both STBR source and STBR target to trigger some intents with KScorer later deciding which intent is better. In other words, this is \"when it is not clear whether a query is about France of Louis XIV, provide KScorer with both options and let it decide\". For this mode mentions_only should be set to 'false' and support_share should be set to 'true'. 3. While annotations for the STBR target are created, no support is given to those annotations. This is more like \"we are mostly sure that a mention of France is about the country, but just for a rare case it is about the monarch, we would like to have Louis XIV annotated\". For this mode mentions_only should be set to 'true' and support_share should be set to 'false'."

          $ref: "#/components/schemas/RepositoryWebrefKGCollection"
          description: Collection that is going to be assigned to the target when the annotation for the target is created. This setting together with allow_wildcard_intents define what intents are allowed to be triggered by the STBR target. At the moment those annotations get created, we can not afford to fetch information about the STBR target from Topic Server, but the target mid by itself doesn't mean much for the Search stack. Setting up the collection for that annotated mid allows us to provide at least some information to the stack on how to treat the mid. This collection together with domain and allow_wildcard_intents fields (see below) defines what intents can be triggered by annotations created for this STBR target. Intents that accept only entities of specific collections can only be triggered if the value of this field matches one of the allowed collections for that intent. In our example, KGCollection.debug_id might be "/collection/people" if we care about context of the monarch as a person, e.g. if we would like to understand queries like [how many children does france have] as [how many childred does lous xiv have]. Or, if we would like to be more restrictive and to only apply the rule to contexts that only make sense for monarch, e.g. [how long did france reign], we might decide to use more specific "/collection/monarchs" instead.

Keep it unset if you want the rule not to depend on local language settings of user's computer.

        mrf:
          description: MRF equivalent representations of this entity as a compound, one for each unique MRF representation. Populated for compounds. Each MRF expression contains a minimum FunctionCall structure wrapped in a nameless Argument without signals and range data. This is not meant to be directly usable as MRF, use QueryJoinToMeaningStructConverter to expand it into a usable form. References to entities are made as component_reference ArgumentValue. Each compound Mention of this entity (not all of its mentions need be compounds, some may be plain entity mentions) have one or more compound_value fields claiming these MRF expressions via their mrf_index. The compound_value has nested components, one for each unique component_reference.index in the MRF expression. The processing expectation is that each ArgumentValue which has a component_reference has its contents discarded and replaced with the MRF for the target entity and mention named by the compound_value.component. If the target is not a compound, the ArgumentValue becomes a simple mid value and the signals are taken from the entity and the mention. If the target is a compound itself, the expansion continues recursively. If the target is a compound with multiple MRFs, a cartesian product of recursive expansions may need to be produced. Along with the component_reference we also emit an example value, but this is purely for human consumption so it's easier to understand what the full compound is like. The processing expectation remains that the ArgumentValue containing a component_reference is completely discarded and rebuilt with the reference target value. If the target has more than one MRF expression, it's not specified which one will be used as an example, except that the choice is guaranteed to be deterministic from run to run.

UDR has the same features and can be used similarly: - To consume the topical entities (+properties, incl. hitcat, browsy, ...) go/udr/migrate-wma provides a migration with minimal changes. - To consume IQL, please consult go/udr/superroot#access and go/pianno team.

We currently support V1 and V3 restrict systems. V3 restrict is a superset of V1 restrict. New users are encouraged to use V3 directly for its rich features and cleaner semantics. See the document go/scam-v3-restricts, or read the comments in //research/scam/proto/restricts.proto for details. Nevertheless, V1 restrict is still supported by ScaM team. There's some minor tradeoff of performance between V1 and V3. User may prefer V1 over V3 if performance is the first priority. However, the CPU cost between V1 and V3 should be very minor. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The semantics of V1 restrict is described below: V1 \"forward\" restricts: The dataset defines a many:many mapping between the database points and a token space. Each token names a set of tokens and each database point is a member of zero-to-many tokens. Queries specify zero-to-many whitelist and blacklist tokens that activate database points according to the following rules: * If whitelist_token is populated, the search will be restricted to points named by at least one whitelist token. If whitelist_token is empty, all points are whitelisted by default. * If blacklist_token is populated, it overrides the whitelist. Points named by a blacklisted token are *not* searched. * Note that, if neither whitelist_token nor blacklist_token is populated, the search remains unrestricted. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- V1 \"reverse\" restricts: Each database point is whitelisted and/or blacklisted for zero or more tokens, specified by whitelist_token and blacklist_token fields. Each query specifies zero or more tokens, and the same rules apply: * If a point's whitelist_token is populated, the point will only be searched if the query has at least one matching whitelist token. If whitelist_token is empty, the point is always whitelisted by default. * If a point's blacklist_token is populated, it overrides the whitelist. The point will be ignored for any query with a matching blacklist token. * Note that, if neither whitelist_token nor blacklist_token is populated, the point will always be searched.

Note that, due to symmetry, if one of the database points is {red, !blue}, that point will be excluded from queries that specify blue.

The field(s) below are for declaring the tokens that name the datapoint that this TokenNamespace proto is attached to. For convenience, we support either string or uint64 tokens. Internally, the restricts system is based on uint64s, but for many applications, strings are the more natural format, and they should be preferred whenever this is the case. * When only uint64s are specified, they will be used as-is. * When only strings are specified, they will be converted to uint64s via Fingerprint2011. (See \"Note on the safety of Fingerprint2011\"). * ADVANCED: When both fields are specified, the uint64s are used as-is. Note that, when both fields are used, they *must* have the same number of entries, and the system will assume that your strings correspond 1:1 with the list of uint64 tokens. * EDGE CASE: All matching is done in the uint64 space, so, I'm not sure why you'd do this, but if, eg, your database uses strings, and your queries specify the Fingerprint2011 hashes of those strings, matching will work, and this is a specified behavior. Note on the safety of Fingerprint2011: Unless you have well over 1M+ unique string tokens, you can safely assume that every string will map to a unique 64-bit token. Internally, both Mustang and PSI use Fingerprint2011 to hash arbitrary strings into uint64 tokens, and assume, without validation, that each 64-bit token is unique. And the math backs up this assumption: If we are using a \"perfect\" hashing function (and Fingerprint2011 is close-enough for our purposes), and we then hash 1M unique tokens into a 64-bit space, there's still better than 99.9999% odds that all tokens are collision-free, nearly as good as the odds for the datacenter's continued existence. Scenarios for having both the string and uint64 token forms: * Probably none that matter to you. Just use the strings directly. * You could have uint64 enum values, yet want to include the string values for debugging purposes. Note that it *is* supported to use a proprietary string => uint64 mapping, assuming that it is consistent, and that you always specify the uint64 values. * The mixer-tier in a multi-shard deployment might convert the strings into uint64s to avoid redundant hashing overhead on the leaves, yet keep the string tokens to preserve proto-level debugging. * When strings are present, I reserve the right to use them for making logging \"better\", but, thusfar, there are 0 examples of this."

All that's stored here is an identifying label.

    SecurityCredentialsSimpleSecretLabelProto:
      description: SimpleSecretProto (in authenticator.proto) and SimpleSecretHolderProto (below) share the notion of a "label", which identifies a particular secret without (hopefully) revealing the secret. Note that a SimpleSecretLabel only disambiguates between secrets used to get access to some particular object. Two different secrets that apply to two different objects could have the same label. For example, in the common sharing model, each object has no more than one "auth key". Therefore, the label for an auth key simply has type = AUTH_KEY with no additional information. In theory, we could add some sort of resource ID to SimpleSecretLabel to make it more explicit. However, in practice, this is never really needed. A SimpleSecret for one object is never used to authorize a request on some other object, so there is no ambiguity. Also, since SimpleSecrets must obviously be unguessable, there is no risk that a SimpleSecret intended for one object will accidentally grant access to another.

It contains an Embed (apps/tacotown/proto/embeds/embed_client.proto) with fields specific to the appropriate type of linked entity. For example, if we are linking to a photo album, the Embed may include the album ID and gaia ID of the creator. Clients that understand the Embed type within the Attachment may construct and/or decorate their link appropriately e.g. to make use of type-specific functionality or first-party integrations. The link_target and (if appropriate) display_url fields must still be set even when an Attachment is present, so that clients who do not know how to interpret the Attachment can fall back to those fields, and render the Segment as an ordinary web link. N.B. Even when an Attachment is present, the intention of a "LINK" Segment is for the Segment to be presented inline with the rest of the text of a post or comment, with a clickable link or other UI suitable for inlining (though the client may modify the UI based on Attachment data, e.g. to add appropriate hovers, icons, etc.). When an entity is intended to be rendered separately from the main body of the post/comment, a separate Attachment proto can be added outside the set of Segments. N.B. Within the Attachment, fields of EmbedClientItem have their own visibility annotations, which should be enforced separately from Segment visibility annotations.

Thus, for a hashtag, it should be "#Foo", and for a link, it should be the display text. Clients that do not understand a particular segment type may use this text, along with the Formatting info below, as a fallback for display. The field is not required -- if all relevant information is carried in other metadata fields and there is no need for a fallback, or it is not practical for a fallback to be provided for any other reason, the field may be left blank. A standard example would be a user reference being transmitted between server layers, where a gaia-ID representation may be sufficient and there is no need for a textual fallback. In such a case, it would be valid and useful - though not required - for servers to compute and populate a fallback on the serving path.

While `partial_name_options` allows the limited profile name to be computed from the core name, the resulting shortened name might change across different versions of the name shortening logic, and we want to preserve the user's choice verbatim whenever possible. This field will be cleared when the two conditions below are met: (1) A successful core name change is not accompanied by a limited profile settings update and (2) The shortened name computed from `partial_name_options` yields a different result than what is originally stored in `verbatim_full_name`. When this happens, the limited profile is effectively *disabled*. E.g., if 'John Doe' from the example above changes their name to 'Jane Doe' and no LimitedProfileSettings are provided, `Jane D.` is the resulting shortened name. Therefore `verbatim_full_name` will be cleared and the limited profile settings will be disabled. On the other hand, if they change their name to `John Dõe`, the resulting shortened name remains `John D.`, and `verbatim_full_name` is kept as is."

The restriction can subsequently be removed with an UpdateStanza call, at which point the post will be treated as if it were newly created. A few notes/limitations about this option: 1. Client should keep a stanza unpublishable for a small period of time (if possible to) so that our ranking system does not consider this as a stale post (thus downranking the post). 2. Client should keep the number of unpublishable stanzas to a minimum, to reduce under-serving. 3. Updating a stanza from publishable to unpublishable after creation is not supported 4. At this time, publishing options are only supported on root stanzas; let us know if you require this for child stanzas. 5. Similarly, this is only supported as a global restriction.

        weakData:
          description: WARNING! The feature is still under active development and the exact semantics may be subject to change pending KE Design Review. Data marked as weak will be less preferred to regular data which does not have the marker. This allows ingesting data with a lower chance of negatively affecting existing features and products, at the cost of potentially not showing the data when competing data is available. Specifically, weak data is less preferred by conflict resolution inside of Livegraph composition. Additionally, RefX triggering will prefer to trigger based on signals computed from regular data. Aside from data providers choosing to mark their data as weak, Livegraph and RefX are the only horizontal systems expected to use this information. Please contact livegraph-team@ if you see a need for this to change. See go/weak-data for more information.

This field is useful when partitioning of data is needed, but using a separate process is intractable due to organizational or infrastructure limitations. For example, if a process such as \"geo\" wishes to distinguish some of their /type/object/name triples as higher priority in Composer's conflict resolution rules, then they can add a config entry with a dedicated ranking_token and tag the relevant triples with that ranking_token. This field should only be used in conjunction with a Composer-side configuration to use it for value selection. It is not appropriate to use this field as free-form metadata. This value must match [[:alnum:]][[:alnum:]_-]{0,127} (i.e., [a-zA-Z0-9]+[a-zA-Z0-9_-]* and must be less than 128 characters in length) , or else its containing triple will be considered malformed and will be rejected by Livegraph at ingress. As of 2018-02-14, this field is used within Livegraph's Composer and is exposed in Livegraph's Lookup APIs to aid debugging, but it is not indexed or served by TopicServer. "

To illustrate, think of 3 sizes: 1) TotalFetchedSize - amount Trawler read over the wire from the server. If they used gzip/deflate, this might be 4-5x smaller than the body. 2) UnTruncatedSize/CutoffSize - how big is the full document, after uncompressing any gzip/deflate encoding? If truncated, this is reflected in CutoffSize. 3) FetchReply::Body size - most crawls enable Trawler compression to save storage space (gzip + a google html dictionary).

Although the WaitNextFlow time is the time spent by a flow in the WaitNextFlow state, its also equivalent to the entire timeline of another flow. It is the time spent in the various states of another flow. In computing the total time spent in the primary flow, one must omit the WaitNextFlow time, since it is already included in the form of slices of individual state time intervals in the aggregated time intervals for other states, and will result in double counting.

    VideoAssetsVenomTransition:
      description: As video mutations are reconciled by Venom, we can tell if the ingredient did or did not reach certain objectives. When processing has completed, all objectives will have a corresponding transition. All transitions are reset for every mutation, but will take into account assets outside of that mutation. For example, if Asset X fails, and was part of "OBJECTIVE_PRIMARY_ASSETS_DONE", a rerun of Asset Y is destined to result in OUTCOME_FAILED, regardless of the fate of Asset Y. Some phenonema have effects on most or all Objectives. For example, a bad input file will result on OUTCOME_INFEASIBLE across the board (eventually, for now it's just GO_LIVE and DO_ALL, work in progress), and a failure to produce Format 18 will cause OUTCOME_FAILED across most Objectives.

Also frame rate can be parsed from headers and can be wrong if it is not available there since ffmpeg uses a heuristic for determining it.

For example, this range can be set to encompass a few days before and after a sports game to which the page refers. If this field is missing, no boosting is performed. Specifying that a page should always be boosted is not recommended, but can be accomplished by setting hot_times.start_unix_time=0 and hot_time.end_unix_time=0x7fffffff. Note that multiple time ranges can be implemented by adding several LiveResultDocBoostData messages to the LiveResultsDocAttachments proto. If overlapping time ranges are used, the proto containing the highest boost level will be used.
