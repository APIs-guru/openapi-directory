If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

There is additional cost for each prediction performed. Unlike manual scaling, if the load gets too heavy for the nodes that are up, the service will automatically add nodes to handle the increased load as well as scale back as traffic drops, always maintaining at least `min_nodes`. You will be charged for the time in which additional nodes are used. If `min_nodes` is not specified and AutoScaling is used with a [legacy (MLS1) machine type](/ml-engine/docs/machine-types-online-prediction), `min_nodes` defaults to 0, in which case, when traffic to a model stops (and after a cool-down period), nodes will be shut down and no charges will be incurred until traffic to the model resumes.

In this field, you can reference [environment variables set by AI Platform Prediction](/ai-platform/prediction/docs/custom-container-requirements#aip-variables) and environment variables set earlier in the same env field as where this message occurs. You cannot reference environment variables set in the Docker image. In order for environment variables to be expanded, reference them by using the following syntax: $(VARIABLE_NAME) Note that this differs from Bash variable expansion, which does not use parentheses. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string is used unchanged. To avoid variable expansion, you can escape this syntax with `$$`; for example: $$(VARIABLE_NAME)"

        maxRunningTime:
          description: "Optional. The maximum job running time, expressed in seconds. The field can contain up to nine fractional digits, terminated by `s`. If not specified, this field defaults to `604800s` (seven days). If the training job is still running after this duration, AI Platform Training cancels it. The duration is measured from when the job enters the `RUNNING` state; therefore it does not overlap with the duration limited by Scheduling.max_wait_time. For example, if you want to ensure your job runs for no more than 2 hours, set this field to `7200s` (2 hours * 60 minutes / hour * 60 seconds / minute). If you submit your training job using the `gcloud` tool, you can [specify this field in a `config.yaml` file](/ai-platform/training/docs/training-jobs#formatting_your_configuration_parameters). For example: ```yaml trainingInput: scheduling: maxRunningTime: 7200s ```"

        maxWaitTime:
          description: "Optional. The maximum job wait time, expressed in seconds. The field can contain up to nine fractional digits, terminated by `s`. If not specified, there is no limit to the wait time. The minimum for this field is `1800s` (30 minutes). If the training job has not entered the `RUNNING` state after this duration, AI Platform Training cancels it. After the job begins running, it can no longer be cancelled due to the maximum wait time. Therefore the duration limited by this field does not overlap with the duration limited by Scheduling.max_running_time. For example, if the job temporarily stops running and retries due to a [VM restart](/ai-platform/training/docs/overview#restarts), this cannot lead to a maximum wait time cancellation. However, independently of this constraint, AI Platform Training might stop a job if there are too many retries due to exhausted resources in a region. The following example describes how you might use this field: To cancel your job if it doesn't start running within 1 hour, set this field to `3600s` (1 hour * 60 minutes / hour * 60 seconds / minute). If the job is still in the `QUEUED` or `PREPARING` state after an hour of waiting, AI Platform Training cancels the job. If you submit your training job using the `gcloud` tool, you can [specify this field in a `config.yaml` file](/ai-platform/training/docs/training-jobs#formatting_your_configuration_parameters). For example: ```yaml trainingInput: scheduling: maxWaitTime: 3600s ```"

A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\", } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/)."
