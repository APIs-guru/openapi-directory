  AuditConfig:
    description: |-
      Specifies the audit configuration for a service.
      The configuration determines which permission types are logged, and what
      identities, if any, are exempted from logging.
      An AuditConfig must have one or more AuditLogConfigs.

      If there are AuditConfigs for both `allServices` and a specific service,
      the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that service: the log_types
      specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and the exempted_members in each
      AuditLogConfig are exempted.

      Example Policy with multiple AuditConfigs:

          {
            "audit_configs": [
              {
                "service": "allServices"
                "audit_log_configs": [
                  {
                    "log_type": "DATA_READ",
                    "exempted_members": [
                      "user:jose@example.com"
                    ]
                  },
                  {
                    "log_type": "DATA_WRITE",
                  },
                  {
                    "log_type": "ADMIN_READ",
                  }
                ]
              },
              {
                "service": "sampleservice.googleapis.com"
                "audit_log_configs": [
                  {
                    "log_type": "DATA_READ",
                  },
                  {
                    "log_type": "DATA_WRITE",
                    "exempted_members": [
                      "user:aliya@example.com"
                    ]
                  }
                ]
              }
            ]
          }

      For sampleservice, this policy enables DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE and ADMIN_READ
      logging. It also exempts jose@example.com from DATA_READ logging, and
      aliya@example.com from DATA_WRITE logging.

              }
            ]
          }

          The uri of the Cloud Storage object. It's the same uri that is used by
          gsutil. For example: "gs://bucket_name/object_name". See [Viewing and

        description: |-
          The uri prefix of all generated Cloud Storage objects. For example:

          "gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix/<asset type>/<shard number> and only
          contains assets for that type. <shard number> starts from 0. For example:
          "gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix/google.compute.disk/0" is the first
          shard of output objects containing all google.compute.disk assets.
          An INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned if file with the same name
          "gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix" already exists.

          If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.

          Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.  It typically
          contains progress information and common metadata such as create time.
          Some services might not provide such metadata.  Any method that returns a
          long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
        type: object
      name:
        description: |-
          The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that
          originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the
          `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.

      response:
        additionalProperties:
          description: Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
        description: |-
          The normal response of the operation in case of success.  If the original
          method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is
          `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard
          `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other
          methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`
          is the original method name.  For example, if the original method name
          is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is
          `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

  Policy:
    description: |-
      Defines an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. It is used to
      specify access control policies for Cloud Platform resources.


      A `Policy` consists of a list of `bindings`. A `binding` binds a list of
      `members` to a `role`, where the members can be user accounts, Google groups,
      Google domains, and service accounts. A `role` is a named list of permissions
      defined by IAM.

      **JSON Example**

          {
            "bindings": [
              {
                "role": "roles/owner",
                "members": [
                  "user:mike@example.com",
                  "group:admins@example.com",
                  "domain:google.com",
                  "serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"
                ]
              },
              {
                "role": "roles/viewer",
                "members": ["user:sean@example.com"]
              }
            ]
          }

      **YAML Example**

          bindings:
          - members:
            - user:mike@example.com
            - group:admins@example.com
            - domain:google.com
            - serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
            role: roles/owner
          - members:
            - user:sean@example.com
            role: roles/viewer

      etag:
        description: |-
          `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
          prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.
          It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
          read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
          conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
          systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to
          ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.

          If no `etag` is provided in the call to `setIamPolicy`, then the existing
          policy is overwritten.

          Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be
          rejected.

          Policies with any conditional bindings must specify version 3. Policies
          without any conditional bindings may specify any valid value or leave the
          field unset.

          For GCP assets, it is the parent resource defined in the [Cloud IAM policy
          hierarchy](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#policy_hierarchy).
          For example:
          `"//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/my_project_123"`.

      The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
      different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
      used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains
      three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.

      You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the
      [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
