Analyzes IAM policies to answer which identities have what accesses on which resources.

### Example

* OAuth Authentication (Oauth2c):
* OAuth Authentication (Oauth2):

```python
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.models.analyze_iam_policy_response import AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://cloudasset.googleapis.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://cloudasset.googleapis.com"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

configuration.access_token = os.environ["ACCESS_TOKEN"]

configuration.access_token = os.environ["ACCESS_TOKEN"]

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.V1p4beta1Api(api_client)
    parent = 'parent_example' # str | Required. The relative name of the root asset. Only resources and IAM policies within the parent will be analyzed. This can only be an organization number (such as \"organizations/123\"), a folder number (such as \"folders/123\"), a project ID (such as \"projects/my-project-id\"), or a project number (such as \"projects/12345\"). To know how to get organization id, visit [here ](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization#retrieving_your_organization_id). To know how to get folder or project id, visit [here ](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-folders#viewing_or_listing_folders_and_projects).

    fields = 'fields_example' # str | Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. (optional)

    oauth_token = 'oauth_token_example' # str | OAuth 2.0 token for the current user. (optional)
    pretty_print = True # bool | Returns response with indentations and line breaks. (optional)

    upload_protocol = 'upload_protocol_example' # str | Upload protocol for media (e.g. \"raw\", \"multipart\"). (optional)
    upload_type = 'upload_type_example' # str | Legacy upload protocol for media (e.g. \"media\", \"multipart\"). (optional)
    analysis_query_access_selector_permissions = ['analysis_query_access_selector_permissions_example'] # List[str] | Optional. The permissions to appear in result. (optional)

    analysis_query_identity_selector_identity = 'analysis_query_identity_selector_identity_example' # str | Required. The identity appear in the form of members in [IAM policy binding](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Binding). The examples of supported forms are: \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\". Notice that wildcard characters (such as * and ?) are not supported. You must give a specific identity. (optional)

The [full resource name](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/resource-name-format) of a resource of [supported resource types](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types#analyzable_asset_types). (optional)
    options_analyze_service_account_impersonation = True # bool | Optional. If true, the response will include access analysis from identities to resources via service account impersonation. This is a very expensive operation, because many derived queries will be executed. We highly recommend you use AssetService.ExportIamPolicyAnalysis rpc instead. For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has permission P, and there's an IAM policy states user A has iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission to a service account SA, and there's another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P to a GCP folder F, then user A potentially has access to the GCP folder F. And those advanced analysis results will be included in AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse.service_account_impersonation_analysis. Another example, if the request analyzes for who has permission P to a GCP folder F, and there's an IAM policy states user A has iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission to a service account SA, and there's another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P to the GCP folder F, then user A potentially has access to the GCP folder F.

    options_execution_timeout = 'options_execution_timeout_example' # str | Optional. Amount of time executable has to complete. See JSON representation of [Duration](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json). If this field is set with a value less than the RPC deadline, and the execution of your query hasn't finished in the specified execution timeout, you will get a response with partial result. Otherwise, your query's execution will continue until the RPC deadline. If it's not finished until then, you will get a DEADLINE_EXCEEDED error. Default is empty. (optional)
    options_expand_groups = True # bool | Optional. If true, the identities section of the result will expand any Google groups appearing in an IAM policy binding. If identity_selector is specified, the identity in the result will be determined by the selector, and this flag will have no effect. Default is false. (optional)
    options_expand_resources = True # bool | Optional. If true, the resource section of the result will expand any resource attached to an IAM policy to include resources lower in the resource hierarchy. For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has permission P, and the results include an IAM policy with P on a GCP folder, the results will also include resources in that folder with permission P. If resource_selector is specified, the resource section of the result will be determined by the selector, and this flag will have no effect. Default is false. (optional)
    options_expand_roles = True # bool | Optional. If true, the access section of result will expand any roles appearing in IAM policy bindings to include their permissions. If access_selector is specified, the access section of the result will be determined by the selector, and this flag will have no effect. Default is false. (optional)
    options_output_group_edges = True # bool | Optional. If true, the result will output group identity edges, starting from the binding's group members, to any expanded identities. Default is false. (optional)
    options_output_resource_edges = True # bool | Optional. If true, the result will output resource edges, starting from the policy attached resource, to any expanded resources. Default is false. (optional)

> Operation cloudasset_export_iam_policy_analysis(parent, xgafv=xgafv, access_token=access_token, alt=alt, param_callback=param_callback, fields=fields, key=key, oauth_token=oauth_token, pretty_print=pretty_print, quota_user=quota_user, upload_protocol=upload_protocol, upload_type=upload_type, export_iam_policy_analysis_request=export_iam_policy_analysis_request)



Exports the answers of which identities have what accesses on which resources to a Google Cloud Storage destination. The output format is the JSON format that represents a AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse in the JSON format. This method implements the google.longrunning.Operation, which allows you to keep track of the export. We recommend intervals of at least 2 seconds with exponential retry to poll the export operation result. The metadata contains the request to help callers to map responses to requests.
