Grammar Syntax: * `filter = \"tag=\" tag | \"tag_function=\" function` * `tag = string` * `function = \"oldest_tag()\"` The `oldest_tag()` function returns tasks which have the same tag as the oldest task (ordered by schedule time). SDK compatibility: Although the SDK allows tags to be either string or [bytes](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/javadoc/com/google/appengine/api/taskqueue/TaskOptions.html#tag-byte:A-), only UTF-8 encoded tags can be used in Cloud Tasks.
