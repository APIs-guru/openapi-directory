Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time. The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue's bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on max_dispatches_per_second. Cloud Tasks will pick the value of `max_burst_size` based on the value of max_dispatches_per_second. For queues that were created or updated using `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` is equal to [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size). Since `max_burst_size` is output only, if UpdateQueue is called on a queue created by `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` will be reset based on the value of max_dispatches_per_second, regardless of whether max_dispatches_per_second is updated.
