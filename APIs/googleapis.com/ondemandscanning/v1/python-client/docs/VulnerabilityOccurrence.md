# VulnerabilityOccurrence

An occurrence of a severity vulnerability on a resource.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**cvss_score** | **float** | Output only. The CVSS score of this vulnerability. CVSS score is on a scale of 0 - 10 where 0 indicates low severity and 10 indicates high severity. | [optional] 
**cvss_v2** | [**CVSS**](CVSS.md) |  | [optional] 
**cvss_version** | **str** | Output only. CVSS version used to populate cvss_score and severity. | [optional] 
**cvssv3** | [**CVSS**](CVSS.md) |  | [optional] 
**effective_severity** | **str** | The distro assigned severity for this vulnerability when it is available, otherwise this is the note provider assigned severity. When there are multiple PackageIssues for this vulnerability, they can have different effective severities because some might be provided by the distro while others are provided by the language ecosystem for a language pack. For this reason, it is advised to use the effective severity on the PackageIssue level. In the case where multiple PackageIssues have differing effective severities, this field should be the highest severity for any of the PackageIssues. | [optional] 
**extra_details** | **str** | Occurrence-specific extra details about the vulnerability. | [optional] 
**fix_available** | **bool** | Output only. Whether at least one of the affected packages has a fix available. | [optional] 
**long_description** | **str** | Output only. A detailed description of this vulnerability. | [optional] 
**package_issue** | [**List[PackageIssue]**](PackageIssue.md) | Required. The set of affected locations and their fixes (if available) within the associated resource. | [optional] 
**related_urls** | [**List[RelatedUrl]**](RelatedUrl.md) | Output only. URLs related to this vulnerability. | [optional] 
**severity** | **str** | Output only. The note provider assigned severity of this vulnerability. | [optional] 
**short_description** | **str** | Output only. A one sentence description of this vulnerability. | [optional] 
**type** | **str** | The type of package; whether native or non native (e.g., ruby gems, node.js packages, etc.). | [optional] 
**vex_assessment** | [**VexAssessment**](VexAssessment.md) |  | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.vulnerability_occurrence import VulnerabilityOccurrence

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of VulnerabilityOccurrence from a JSON string
vulnerability_occurrence_instance = VulnerabilityOccurrence.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(VulnerabilityOccurrence.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
vulnerability_occurrence_dict = vulnerability_occurrence_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of VulnerabilityOccurrence from a dict
vulnerability_occurrence_from_dict = VulnerabilityOccurrence.from_dict(vulnerability_occurrence_dict)
