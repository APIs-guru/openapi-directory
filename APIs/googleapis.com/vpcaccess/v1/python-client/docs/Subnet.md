# Subnet

The subnet in which to house the connector

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**name** | **str** | Subnet name (relative, not fully qualified). E.g. if the full subnet selfLink is https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/regions/{region}/subnetworks/{subnetName} the correct input for this field would be {subnetName} | [optional] 
**project_id** | **str** | Project in which the subnet exists. If not set, this project is assumed to be the project for which the connector create request was issued. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.subnet import Subnet

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Subnet from a JSON string
subnet_instance = Subnet.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(Subnet.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
subnet_dict = subnet_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Subnet from a dict
subnet_from_dict = Subnet.from_dict(subnet_dict)
