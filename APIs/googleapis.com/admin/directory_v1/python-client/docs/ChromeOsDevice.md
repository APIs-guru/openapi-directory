## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.chrome_os_device import ChromeOsDevice

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of ChromeOsDevice from a JSON string
chrome_os_device_instance = ChromeOsDevice.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(ChromeOsDevice.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
chrome_os_device_dict = chrome_os_device_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of ChromeOsDevice from a dict
chrome_os_device_from_dict = ChromeOsDevice.from_dict(chrome_os_device_dict)
