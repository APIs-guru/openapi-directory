If the job has a body and the following headers are not set by the user, Cloud Scheduler sets default values: * `Content-Type`: This will be set to `"application/octet-stream"`. You can override this default by explicitly setting `Content-Type` to a particular media type when creating the job. For example, you can set `Content-Type` to `"application/json"`. The headers below are output only.

Cloud Scheduler will never allow two simultaneously outstanding executions. For example, this implies that if the `n+1`th execution is scheduled to run at 16:00 but the `n`th execution takes until 16:15, the `n+1`th execution will not start until `16:15`. A scheduled start time will be delayed if the previous execution has not ended when its scheduled time occurs.
