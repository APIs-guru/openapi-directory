# RawEncryptRequest

Request message for KeyManagementService.RawEncrypt.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**additional_authenticated_data** | **bytearray** | Optional. Optional data that, if specified, must also be provided during decryption through RawDecryptRequest.additional_authenticated_data. This field may only be used in conjunction with an algorithm that accepts additional authenticated data (for example, AES-GCM). The maximum size depends on the key version&#39;s protection_level. For SOFTWARE keys, the plaintext must be no larger than 64KiB. For HSM keys, the combined length of the plaintext and additional_authenticated_data fields must be no larger than 8KiB. | [optional] 
**additional_authenticated_data_crc32c** | **str** | Optional. An optional CRC32C checksum of the RawEncryptRequest.additional_authenticated_data. If specified, KeyManagementService will verify the integrity of the received additional_authenticated_data using this checksum. KeyManagementService will report an error if the checksum verification fails. If you receive a checksum error, your client should verify that CRC32C(additional_authenticated_data) is equal to additional_authenticated_data_crc32c, and if so, perform a limited number of retries. A persistent mismatch may indicate an issue in your computation of the CRC32C checksum. Note: This field is defined as int64 for reasons of compatibility across different languages. However, it is a non-negative integer, which will never exceed 2^32-1, and can be safely downconverted to uint32 in languages that support this type. | [optional] 
**initialization_vector** | **bytearray** | Optional. A customer-supplied initialization vector that will be used for encryption. If it is not provided for AES-CBC and AES-CTR, one will be generated. It will be returned in RawEncryptResponse.initialization_vector. | [optional] 
**initialization_vector_crc32c** | **str** | Optional. An optional CRC32C checksum of the RawEncryptRequest.initialization_vector. If specified, KeyManagementService will verify the integrity of the received initialization_vector using this checksum. KeyManagementService will report an error if the checksum verification fails. If you receive a checksum error, your client should verify that CRC32C(initialization_vector) is equal to initialization_vector_crc32c, and if so, perform a limited number of retries. A persistent mismatch may indicate an issue in your computation of the CRC32C checksum. Note: This field is defined as int64 for reasons of compatibility across different languages. However, it is a non-negative integer, which will never exceed 2^32-1, and can be safely downconverted to uint32 in languages that support this type. | [optional] 
**plaintext** | **bytearray** | Required. The data to encrypt. Must be no larger than 64KiB. The maximum size depends on the key version&#39;s protection_level. For SOFTWARE keys, the plaintext must be no larger than 64KiB. For HSM keys, the combined length of the plaintext and additional_authenticated_data fields must be no larger than 8KiB. | [optional] 
**plaintext_crc32c** | **str** | Optional. An optional CRC32C checksum of the RawEncryptRequest.plaintext. If specified, KeyManagementService will verify the integrity of the received plaintext using this checksum. KeyManagementService will report an error if the checksum verification fails. If you receive a checksum error, your client should verify that CRC32C(plaintext) is equal to plaintext_crc32c, and if so, perform a limited number of retries. A persistent mismatch may indicate an issue in your computation of the CRC32C checksum. Note: This field is defined as int64 for reasons of compatibility across different languages. However, it is a non-negative integer, which will never exceed 2^32-1, and can be safely downconverted to uint32 in languages that support this type. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.raw_encrypt_request import RawEncryptRequest

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of RawEncryptRequest from a JSON string
raw_encrypt_request_instance = RawEncryptRequest.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(RawEncryptRequest.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
raw_encrypt_request_dict = raw_encrypt_request_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of RawEncryptRequest from a dict
raw_encrypt_request_from_dict = RawEncryptRequest.from_dict(raw_encrypt_request_dict)
```
