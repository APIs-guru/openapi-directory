## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.execution_stage_summary import ExecutionStageSummary

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of ExecutionStageSummary from a JSON string
execution_stage_summary_instance = ExecutionStageSummary.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(ExecutionStageSummary.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
execution_stage_summary_dict = execution_stage_summary_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of ExecutionStageSummary from a dict
execution_stage_summary_from_dict = ExecutionStageSummary.from_dict(execution_stage_summary_dict)
