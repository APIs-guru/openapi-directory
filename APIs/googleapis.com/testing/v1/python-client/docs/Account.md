# Account

Identifies an account and how to log into it.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**google_auto** | **object** | Enables automatic Google account login. If set, the service automatically generates a Google test account and adds it to the device, before executing the test. Note that test accounts might be reused. Many applications show their full set of functionalities when an account is present on the device. Logging into the device with these generated accounts allows testing more functionalities. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.account import Account

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Account from a JSON string
account_instance = Account.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(Account.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
account_dict = account_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Account from a dict
account_from_dict = Account.from_dict(account_dict)
```
