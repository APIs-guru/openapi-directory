      description: Cancels a transfer. Use the transferOperations.get method to check if the cancellation succeeded or if the operation completed despite the `cancel` request. When you cancel an operation, the currently running transfer is interrupted. For recurring transfer jobs, the next instance of the transfer job will still run. For example, if your job is configured to run every day at 1pm and you cancel Monday's operation at 1:05pm, Monday's transfer will stop. However, a transfer job will still be attempted on Tuesday. This applies only to currently running operations. If an operation is not currently running, `cancel` does nothing. *Caution:* Canceling a transfer job can leave your data in an unknown state. We recommend that you restore the state at both the destination and the source after the `cancel` request completes so that your data is in a consistent state. When you cancel a job, the next job computes a delta of files and may repair any inconsistent state. For instance, if you run a job every day, and today's job found 10 new files and transferred five files before you canceled the job, tomorrow's transfer operation will compute a new delta with the five files that were not copied today plus any new files discovered tomorrow.

Subsequent lines specify the information of the list of objects, one object per list entry. Each entry has the following tab-delimited fields: * **HTTP URL** — The location of the object. * **Length** — The size of the object in bytes. * **MD5** — The base64-encoded MD5 hash of the object. For an example of a valid TSV file, see [Transferring data from URLs](https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/create-url-list). When transferring data based on a URL list, keep the following in mind: * When an object located at `http(s)://hostname:port/` is transferred to a data sink, the name of the object at the data sink is `/`. * If the specified size of an object does not match the actual size of the object fetched, the object is not transferred. * If the specified MD5 does not match the MD5 computed from the transferred bytes, the object transfer fails. * Ensure that each URL you specify is publicly accessible. For example, in Cloud Storage you can [share an object publicly] (/storage/docs/cloud-console#_sharingdata) and get a link to it. * Storage Transfer Service obeys `robots.txt` rules and requires the source HTTP server to support `Range` requests and to return a `Content-Length` header in each response. * ObjectConditions have no effect when filtering objects to transfer.'
