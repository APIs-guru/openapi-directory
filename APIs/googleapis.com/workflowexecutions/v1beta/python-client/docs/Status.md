------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**current_steps** | [**List[Step]**](Step.md) | A list of currently executing or last executed step names for the workflow execution currently running. If the workflow has succeeded or failed, this is the last attempted or executed step. Presently, if the current step is inside a subworkflow, the list only includes that step. In the future, the list will contain items for each step in the call stack, starting with the outermost step in the &#x60;main&#x60; subworkflow, and ending with the most deeply nested step. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.status import Status

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Status from a JSON string
status_instance = Status.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(Status.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
status_dict = status_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Status from a dict
status_from_dict = Status.from_dict(status_dict)
