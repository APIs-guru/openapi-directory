# GrpcRouteStatefulSessionAffinityPolicy

The specification for cookie-based stateful session affinity where the date plane supplies a “session cookie” with the name \"GSSA\" which encodes a specific destination host and each request containing that cookie will be directed to that host as long as the destination host remains up and healthy. The gRPC proxyless mesh library or sidecar proxy will manage the session cookie but the client application code is responsible for copying the cookie from each RPC in the session to the next.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**cookie_ttl** | **str** | Required. The cookie TTL value for the Set-Cookie header generated by the data plane. The lifetime of the cookie may be set to a value from 1 to 86400 seconds (24 hours) inclusive. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.grpc_route_stateful_session_affinity_policy import GrpcRouteStatefulSessionAffinityPolicy

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of GrpcRouteStatefulSessionAffinityPolicy from a JSON string
grpc_route_stateful_session_affinity_policy_instance = GrpcRouteStatefulSessionAffinityPolicy.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(GrpcRouteStatefulSessionAffinityPolicy.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
grpc_route_stateful_session_affinity_policy_dict = grpc_route_stateful_session_affinity_policy_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of GrpcRouteStatefulSessionAffinityPolicy from a dict
grpc_route_stateful_session_affinity_policy_from_dict = GrpcRouteStatefulSessionAffinityPolicy.from_dict(grpc_route_stateful_session_affinity_policy_dict)
