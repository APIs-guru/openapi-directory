        pubsubTopic:
          description: "Optional. The name of the Pub/Sub topic where budget-related messages are published, in the form `projects/{project_id}/topics/{topic_id}`. Updates are sent to the topic at regular intervals; the timing of the updates is not dependent on the [threshold rules](#thresholdrule) you've set. Note that if you want your [Pub/Sub JSON object](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications#notification_format) to contain data for `alertThresholdExceeded`, you need at least one [alert threshold rule](#thresholdrule). When you set threshold rules, you must also enable at least one of the email notification options, either using the default IAM recipients or Cloud Monitoring email notification channels. To use Pub/Sub topics with budgets, you must do the following: 1. Create the Pub/Sub topic before connecting it to your budget. For guidance, see [Manage programmatic budget alert notifications](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications). 2. Grant the API caller the `pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy` permission on the Pub/Sub topic. If not set, the API call fails with PERMISSION_DENIED. For additional details on Pub/Sub roles and permissions, see [Permissions required for this task](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications#permissions_required_for_this_task)."

    GoogleCloudBillingBudgetsV1ThresholdRule:
      description: ThresholdRule contains the definition of a threshold. Threshold rules define the triggering events used to generate a budget notification email. When a threshold is crossed (spend exceeds the specified percentages of the budget), budget alert emails are sent to the email recipients you specify in the [NotificationsRule](#notificationsrule). Threshold rules also affect the fields included in the [JSON data object](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications#notification_format) sent to a Pub/Sub topic. Threshold rules are _required_ if using email notifications. Threshold rules are _optional_ if only setting a [`pubsubTopic` NotificationsRule](#NotificationsRule), unless you want your JSON data object to include data about the thresholds you set. For more information, see [set budget threshold rules and actions](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets#budget-actions).
