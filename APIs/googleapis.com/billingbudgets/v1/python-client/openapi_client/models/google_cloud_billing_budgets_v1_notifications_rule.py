The value is the full REST resource name of a Cloud Monitoring email notification channel with the form `projects/{project_id}/notificationChannels/{channel_id}`. A maximum of 5 email notifications are allowed. To customize budget alert email recipients with monitoring notification channels, you _must create the monitoring notification channels before you link them to a budget_. For guidance on setting up notification channels to use with budgets, see [Customize budget alert email recipients](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-notification-recipients). For Cloud Billing budget alerts, you _must use email notification channels_. The other types of notification channels are _not_ supported, such as Slack, SMS, or PagerDuty. If you want to [send budget notifications to Slack](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/notify#send_notifications_to_slack), use a pubsubTopic and configure [programmatic notifications](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications).", alias="monitoringNotificationChannels")

Updates are sent to the topic at regular intervals; the timing of the updates is not dependent on the [threshold rules](#thresholdrule) you've set. Note that if you want your [Pub/Sub JSON object](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications#notification_format) to contain data for `alertThresholdExceeded`, you need at least one [alert threshold rule](#thresholdrule). When you set threshold rules, you must also enable at least one of the email notification options, either using the default IAM recipients or Cloud Monitoring email notification channels. To use Pub/Sub topics with budgets, you must do the following: 1. Create the Pub/Sub topic before connecting it to your budget. For guidance, see [Manage programmatic budget alert notifications](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications). 2. Grant the API caller the `pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy` permission on the Pub/Sub topic. If not set, the API call fails with PERMISSION_DENIED.
