        Execute an action remotely.

        In order to execute an action, the client must first upload all of the
        inputs, the
        Command to run, and the
        Action into the
        ContentAddressableStorage.
        It then calls `Execute` with an `action_digest` referring to them. The
        server will run the action and eventually return the result.

        The input `Action`'s fields MUST meet the various canonicalization
        requirements specified in the documentation for their types so that it has
        the same digest as other logically equivalent `Action`s. The server MAY
        enforce the requirements and return errors if a non-canonical input is
        received. It MAY also proceed without verifying some or all of the
        requirements, such as for performance reasons. If the server does not
        verify the requirement, then it will treat the `Action` as distinct from
        another logically equivalent action if they hash differently.

        Returns a stream of
        google.longrunning.Operation messages
        describing the resulting execution, with eventual `response`
        ExecuteResponse. The
        `metadata` on the operation is of type
        ExecuteOperationMetadata.

        If the client remains connected after the first response is returned after
        the server, then updates are streamed as if the client had called
        WaitExecution
        until the execution completes or the request reaches an error. The
        operation can also be queried using Operations
        API.

        The server NEED NOT implement other methods or functionality of the
        Operations API.

        Errors discovered during creation of the `Operation` will be reported
        as gRPC Status errors, while errors that occurred while running the
        action will be reported in the `status` field of the `ExecuteResponse`. The
        server MUST NOT set the `error` field of the `Operation` proto.
        The possible errors include:

        * `INVALID_ARGUMENT`: One or more arguments are invalid.
        * `FAILED_PRECONDITION`: One or more errors occurred in setting up the
          action requested, such as a missing input or command or no worker being
          available. The client may be able to fix the errors and retry.
        * `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`: There is insufficient quota of some resource to run
          the action.
        * `UNAVAILABLE`: Due to a transient condition, such as all workers being
          occupied (and the server does not support a queue), the action could not
          be started. The client should retry.
        * `INTERNAL`: An internal error occurred in the execution engine or the
          worker.
        * `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`: The execution timed out.
        * `CANCELLED`: The operation was cancelled by the client. This status is
          only possible if the server implements the Operations API CancelOperation
          method, and it was called for the current execution.

        In the case of a missing input or command, the server SHOULD additionally
        send a PreconditionFailure error detail
        where, for each requested blob not present in the CAS, there is a
        `Violation` with a `type` of `MISSING` and a `subject` of
        `"blobs/{hash}/{size}"` indicating the digest of the missing blob.

        (CAS). The server will enumerate the `Directory` tree recursively and
        return every node descended from the root.

        The GetTreeRequest.page_token parameter can be used to skip ahead in
        the stream (e.g. when retrying a partially completed and aborted request),

  BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2Action:
    description: |-
      An `Action` captures all the information about an execution which is required
      to reproduce it.

      `Action`s are the core component of the [Execution] service. A single
      `Action` represents a repeatable action that can be performed by the
      execution service. `Action`s can be succinctly identified by the digest of
      their wire format encoding and, once an `Action` has been executed, will be
      cached in the action cache. Future requests can then use the cached result
      rather than needing to run afresh.

      When a server completes execution of an
      Action, it MAY choose to
      cache the result in
      the ActionCache unless
      `do_not_cache` is `true`. Clients SHOULD expect the server to do so. By
      default, future calls to
      Execute the same
      `Action` will also serve their results from the cache. Clients must take care
      to understand the caching behaviour. Ideally, all `Action`s will be
      reproducible so that serving a result from cache is always desirable and
      correct.

          directory, as well as every subdirectory and content blob referred to, MUST
          be in the
          ContentAddressableStorage.
      timeout:
        description: |-
          A timeout after which the execution should be killed. If the timeout is
          absent, then the client is specifying that the execution should continue
          as long as the server will let it. The server SHOULD impose a timeout if
          the client does not specify one, however, if the client does specify a
          timeout that is longer than the server's maximum timeout, the server MUST
          reject the request.

          The timeout is a part of the
          Action message, and
          therefore two `Actions` with different timeouts are different, even if they
          are otherwise identical. This is because, if they were not, running an
          `Action` with a lower timeout than is required might result in a cache hit
          from an execution run with a longer timeout, hiding the fact that the
          timeout is too short. By encoding it directly in the `Action`, a lower
          timeout will result in a cache miss and the execution timeout will fail
          immediately, rather than whenever the cache entry gets evicted.

          output_directories member.

          As an example, suppose the Action had an output directory `a/b/dir` and the
          execution produced the following contents in `a/b/dir`: a file named `bar`

  BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2Digest:
    description: |-
      A content digest. A digest for a given blob consists of the size of the blob
      and its hash. The hash algorithm to use is defined by the server, but servers
      SHOULD use SHA-256.

      The size is considered to be an integral part of the digest and cannot be
      separated. That is, even if the `hash` field is correctly specified but
      `size_bytes` is not, the server MUST reject the request.

      The reason for including the size in the digest is as follows: in a great
      many cases, the server needs to know the size of the blob it is about to work
      with prior to starting an operation with it, such as flattening Merkle tree
      structures or streaming it to a worker. Technically, the server could
      implement a separate metadata store, but this results in a significantly more
      complicated implementation as opposed to having the client specify the size
      up-front (or storing the size along with the digest in every message where
      digests are embedded). This does mean that the API leaks some implementation
      details of (what we consider to be) a reasonable server implementation, but
      we consider this to be a worthwhile tradeoff.

      When a `Digest` is used to refer to a proto message, it always refers to the
      message in binary encoded form. To ensure consistent hashing, clients and
      servers MUST ensure that they serialize messages according to the following
      rules, even if there are alternate valid encodings for the same message:

      * Fields are serialized in tag order.
      * There are no unknown fields.
      * There are no duplicate fields.
      * Fields are serialized according to the default semantics for their type.

      Most protocol buffer implementations will always follow these rules when
      serializing, but care should be taken to avoid shortcuts. For instance,
      concatenating two messages to merge them may produce duplicate fields.

  BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2Directory:
    description: |-
      A `Directory` represents a directory node in a file tree, containing zero or
      more children FileNodes,
      DirectoryNodes and
      SymlinkNodes.
      Each `Node` contains its name in the directory, either the digest of its
      content (either a file blob or a `Directory` proto) or a symlink target, as
      well as possibly some metadata about the file or directory.

      In order to ensure that two equivalent directory trees hash to the same
      value, the following restrictions MUST be obeyed when constructing a
      a `Directory`:

      * Every child in the directory must have a path of exactly one segment.
        Multiple levels of directory hierarchy may not be collapsed.
      * Each child in the directory must have a unique path segment (file name).
      * The files, directories and symlinks in the directory must each be sorted
        in lexicographical order by path. The path strings must be sorted by code
        point, equivalently, by UTF-8 bytes.

      A `Directory` that obeys the restrictions is said to be in canonical form.

      As an example, the following could be used for a file named `bar` and a
      directory named `foo` with an executable file named `baz` (hashes shortened
      for readability):

      ```json

  BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2PlatformProperty:
    description: |-
      A single property for the environment. The server is responsible for
      specifying the property `name`s that it accepts. If an unknown `name` is
      provided in the requirements for an
      Action, the server SHOULD
      reject the execution request. If permitted by the server, the same `name`
      may occur multiple times.

      The server is also responsible for specifying the interpretation of
      property `value`s. For instance, a property describing how much RAM must be
      available may be interpreted as allowing a worker with 16GB to fulfill a
      request for 8GB, while a property describing the OS environment on which
      the action must be performed may require an exact match with the worker's
      OS.

      The server MAY use the `value` of one or more properties to determine how
      it sets up the execution environment, such as by making specific system
      files available to the worker.

      priority:
        description: |-
          The priority (relative importance) of this content in the overall cache.
          Generally, a lower value means a longer retention time or other advantage,
          but the interpretation of a given value is server-dependent. A priority of
          0 means a *default* value, decided by the server.

          The particular semantics of this field is up to the server. In particular,
          every server will have their own supported range of priorities, and will
          decide how these map into retention/eviction policy.

  GoogleDevtoolsRemoteexecutionV1testDigest:
    description: |-
      A content digest. A digest for a given blob consists of the size of the blob
      and its hash. The hash algorithm to use is defined by the server, but servers
      SHOULD use SHA-256.

      The size is considered to be an integral part of the digest and cannot be
      separated. That is, even if the `hash` field is correctly specified but
      `size_bytes` is not, the server MUST reject the request.

      The reason for including the size in the digest is as follows: in a great
      many cases, the server needs to know the size of the blob it is about to work
      with prior to starting an operation with it, such as flattening Merkle tree
      structures or streaming it to a worker. Technically, the server could
      implement a separate metadata store, but this results in a significantly more
      complicated implementation as opposed to having the client specify the size
      up-front (or storing the size along with the digest in every message where
      digests are embedded). This does mean that the API leaks some implementation
      details of (what we consider to be) a reasonable server implementation, but
      we consider this to be a worthwhile tradeoff.

      When a `Digest` is used to refer to a proto message, it always refers to the
      message in binary encoded form. To ensure consistent hashing, clients and
      servers MUST ensure that they serialize messages according to the following
      rules, even if there are alternate valid encodings for the same message.
      - Fields are serialized in tag order.
      - There are no unknown fields.
      - There are no duplicate fields.
      - Fields are serialized according to the default semantics for their type.

      Most protocol buffer implementations will always follow these rules when
      serializing, but care should be taken to avoid shortcuts. For instance,
      concatenating two messages to merge them may produce duplicate fields.

  GoogleDevtoolsRemoteexecutionV1testDirectory:
    description: |-
      A `Directory` represents a directory node in a file tree, containing zero or
      more children FileNodes
      and DirectoryNodes.
      Each `Node` contains its name in the directory, the digest of its content
      (either a file blob or a `Directory` proto), as well as possibly some
      metadata about the file or directory.

      In order to ensure that two equivalent directory trees hash to the same
      value, the following restrictions MUST be obeyed when constructing a
      a `Directory`:
        - Every child in the directory must have a path of exactly one segment.
          Multiple levels of directory hierarchy may not be collapsed.
        - Each child in the directory must have a unique path segment (file name).
        - The files and directories in the directory must each be sorted in
          lexicographical order by path. The path strings must be sorted by code
          point, equivalently, by UTF-8 bytes.

      A `Directory` that obeys the restrictions is said to be in canonical form.

      As an example, the following could be used for a file named `bar` and a
      directory named `foo` with an executable file named `baz` (hashes shortened
      for readability):

      If this message proves to be sufficient, it will be renamed in the alpha or
      beta release of this API.

      This message (suitably marshalled into a protobuf.Any) can be used as the

  GoogleRpcStatus:
    description: |-
      The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different
      programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
      [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:

      - Simple to use and understand for most users
      - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs

      # Overview

      The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
      and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
      google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
      error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
      developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
      error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
      localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
      information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
      in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.

      # Language mapping

      The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
      is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
      exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
      mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
      in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.

      # Other uses

      The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
      environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
      consistent developer experience across different environments.

      Example uses of this error model include:

      - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
          it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
          errors.

      - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
          have a `Status` message for error reporting.

      - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
          `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
          each error sub-response.

      - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
          results in its response, the status of those operations should be
          represented directly using the `Status` message.

      - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
          be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
