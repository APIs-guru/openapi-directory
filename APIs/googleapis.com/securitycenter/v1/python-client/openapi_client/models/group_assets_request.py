This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and read_time. The state change value is derived based on the presence of the asset at the two points in time. Intermediate state changes between the two times don't affect the result. For example, the results aren't affected if the asset is removed and re-created again. Possible \"state_change\" values when compare_duration is specified: * \"ADDED\": indicates that the asset was not present at the start of compare_duration, but present at reference_time. * \"REMOVED\": indicates that the asset was present at the start of compare_duration, but not present at reference_time. * \"ACTIVE\": indicates that the asset was present at both the start and the end of the time period defined by compare_duration and reference_time. If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible state_change is \"UNUSED\", which will be the state_change set for all assets present at read_time.

The expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via logical operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-` character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields map to those defined in the Asset resource. Examples include: * name * security_center_properties.resource_name * resource_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings. The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes. The following field and operator combinations are supported: * name: `=` * update_time: `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string. Examples: `update_time = \"2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00\"` `update_time = 1560208038000` * create_time: `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string. Examples: `create_time = \"2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00\"` `create_time = 1560208038000` * iam_policy.policy_blob: `=`, `:` * resource_properties: `=`, `:`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_name: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_display_name: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_type: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_parent: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_parent_display_name: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_project: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_project_display_name: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_owners: `=`, `:` For example, `resource_properties.size = 100` is a valid filter string.
