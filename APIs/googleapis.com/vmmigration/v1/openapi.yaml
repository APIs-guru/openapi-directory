To override the binding, API services can add a binding such as `\"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations\"` to their service configuration. For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding is the parent resource, without the operations collection id."

While the migration cycles of a MigratingVm take place, it is possible to verify the uploaded VM can be started in the cloud, by creating a clone. The clone can be created without any downtime, and it is created using the latest snapshots which are already in the cloud. The cloneJob is only responsible for its work, not its products, which means once it is finished, it will never touch the instance it created. It will only delete it in case of the CloneJob being cancelled or upon failure to clone.

          description: A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and t he request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
