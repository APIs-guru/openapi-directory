# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of WipeAction from a JSON string
wipe_action_instance = WipeAction.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(WipeAction.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
wipe_action_dict = wipe_action_instance.to_dict()
