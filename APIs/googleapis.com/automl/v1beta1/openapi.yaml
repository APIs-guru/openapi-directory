The formats are: * For Image Classification: CSV file(s) with each line having just a single column: GCS_FILE_PATH which leads to image of up to 30MB in size. Supported extensions: .JPEG, .GIF, .PNG. This path is treated as the ID in the Batch predict output. Three sample rows: gs://folder/image1.jpeg gs://folder/image2.gif gs://folder/image3.png * For Image Object Detection: CSV file(s) with each line having just a single column: GCS_FILE_PATH which leads to image of up to 30MB in size. Supported extensions: .JPEG, .GIF, .PNG. This path is treated as the ID in the Batch predict output. Three sample rows: gs://folder/image1.jpeg gs://folder/image2.gif gs://folder/image3.png * For Video Classification: CSV file(s) with each line in format: GCS_FILE_PATH,TIME_SEGMENT_START,TIME_SEGMENT_END GCS_FILE_PATH leads to video of up to 50GB in size and up to 3h duration. Supported extensions: .MOV, .MPEG4, .MP4, .AVI. TIME_SEGMENT_START and TIME_SEGMENT_END must be within the length of the video, and end has to be after the start. Three sample rows: gs://folder/video1.mp4,10,40 gs://folder/video1.mp4,20,60 gs://folder/vid2.mov,0,inf * For Video Object Tracking: CSV file(s) with each line in format: GCS_FILE_PATH,TIME_SEGMENT_START,TIME_SEGMENT_END GCS_FILE_PATH leads to video of up to 50GB in size and up to 3h duration. Supported extensions: .MOV, .MPEG4, .MP4, .AVI. TIME_SEGMENT_START and TIME_SEGMENT_END must be within the length of the video, and end has to be after the start. Three sample rows: gs://folder/video1.mp4,10,240 gs://folder/video1.mp4,300,360 gs://folder/vid2.mov,0,inf * For Text Classification: CSV file(s) with each line having just a single column: GCS_FILE_PATH | TEXT_SNIPPET Any given text file can have size upto 128kB. Any given text snippet content must have 60,000 characters or less. Three sample rows: gs://folder/text1.txt \"Some text content to predict\" gs://folder/text3.pdf Supported file extensions: .txt, .pdf * For Text Sentiment: CSV file(s) with each line having just a single column: GCS_FILE_PATH | TEXT_SNIPPET Any given text file can have size upto 128kB. Any given text snippet content must have 500 characters or less. Three sample rows: gs://folder/text1.txt \"Some text content to predict\" gs://folder/text3.pdf Supported file extensions: .txt, .pdf * For Text Extraction .JSONL (i.e. JSON Lines) file(s) which either provide text in-line or as documents (for a single BatchPredict call only one of the these formats may be used). The in-line .JSONL file(s) contain per line a proto that wraps a temporary user-assigned TextSnippet ID (string up to 2000 characters long) called \"id\", a TextSnippet proto (in json representation) and zero or more TextFeature protos. Any given text snippet content must have 30,000 characters or less, and also be UTF-8 NFC encoded (ASCII already is). The IDs provided should be unique. The document .JSONL file(s) contain, per line, a proto that wraps a Document proto with input_config set. Only PDF documents are supported now, and each document must be up to 2MB large. Any given .JSONL file must be 100MB or smaller, and no more than 20 files may be given. Sample in-line JSON Lines file (presented here with artificial line breaks, but the only actual line break is denoted by \\n): { \"id\": \"my_first_id\", \"text_snippet\": { \"content\": \"dog car cat\"}, \"text_features\": [ { \"text_segment\": {\"start_offset\": 4, \"end_offset\": 6}, \"structural_type\": PARAGRAPH, \"bounding_poly\": { \"normalized_vertices\": [ {\"x\": 0.1, \"y\": 0.1}, {\"x\": 0.1, \"y\": 0.3}, {\"x\": 0.3, \"y\": 0.3}, {\"x\": 0.3, \"y\": 0.1}, ] }, } ], }\\n { \"id\": \"2\", \"text_snippet\": { \"content\": \"An elaborate content\", \"mime_type\": \"text/plain\" } } Sample document JSON Lines file (presented here with artificial line breaks, but the only actual line break is denoted by \\n).: { \"document\": { \"input_config\": { \"gcs_source\": { \"input_uris\": [ \"gs://folder/document1.pdf\" ] } } } }\\n { \"document\": { \"input_config\": { \"gcs_source\": { \"input_uris\": [ \"gs://folder/document2.pdf\" ] } } } } * For Tables: Either gcs_source or bigquery_source. GCS case: CSV file(s), each by itself 10GB or smaller and total size must be 100GB or smaller, where first file must have a header containing column names. If the first row of a subsequent file is the same as the header, then it is also treated as a header. All other rows contain values for the corresponding columns. The column names must contain the model's input_feature_column_specs' display_name-s (order doesn't matter). The columns corresponding to the model's input feature column specs must contain values compatible with the column spec's data types. Prediction on all the rows, i.e. the CSV lines, will be attempted. For FORECASTING prediction_type: all columns having TIME_SERIES_AVAILABLE_PAST_ONLY type will be ignored. First three sample rows of a CSV file: \"First Name\",\"Last Name\",\"Dob\",\"Addresses\" \"John\",\"Doe\",\"1968-01-22\",\"[{\"status\":\"current\",\"address\":\"123_First_Avenue\",\"city\":\"Seattle\",\"state\":\"WA\",\"zip\":\"11111\",\"numberOfYears\":\"1\"},{\"status\":\"previous\",\"address\":\"456_Main_Street\",\"city\":\"Portland\",\"state\":\"OR\",\"zip\":\"22222\",\"numberOfYears\":\"5\"}]\" \"Jane\",\"Doe\",\"1980-10-16\",\"[{\"status\":\"current\",\"address\":\"789_Any_Avenue\",\"city\":\"Albany\",\"state\":\"NY\",\"zip\":\"33333\",\"numberOfYears\":\"2\"},{\"status\":\"previous\",\"address\":\"321_Main_Street\",\"city\":\"Hoboken\",\"state\":\"NJ\",\"zip\":\"44444\",\"numberOfYears\":\"3\"}]} BigQuery case: An URI of a BigQuery table. The user data size of the BigQuery table must be 100GB or smaller. The column names must contain the model's input_feature_column_specs' display_name-s (order doesn't matter). The columns corresponding to the model's input feature column specs must contain values compatible with the column spec's data types. Prediction on all the rows of the table will be attempted. For FORECASTING prediction_type: all columns having TIME_SERIES_AVAILABLE_PAST_ONLY type will be ignored. Definitions: GCS_FILE_PATH = A path to file on GCS, e.g. \"gs://folder/video.avi\". TEXT_SNIPPET = A content of a text snippet, UTF-8 encoded, enclosed within double quotes (\"\") TIME_SEGMENT_START = TIME_OFFSET Expresses a beginning, inclusive, of a time segment within an example that has a time dimension (e.g. video). TIME_SEGMENT_END = TIME_OFFSET Expresses an end, exclusive, of a time segment within an example that has a time dimension (e.g. video). TIME_OFFSET = A number of seconds as measured from the start of an example (e.g. video). Fractions are allowed, up to a microsecond precision. \"inf\" is allowed and it means the end of the example. Errors: If any of the provided CSV files can't be parsed or if more than certain percent of CSV rows cannot be processed then the operation fails and prediction does not happen. Regardless of overall success or failure the per-row failures, up to a certain count cap, will be listed in Operation.metadata.partial_failures."

    BatchPredictOutputConfig:
      description: "Output configuration for BatchPredict Action. As destination the gcs_destination must be set unless specified otherwise for a domain. If gcs_destination is set then in the given directory a new directory is created. Its name will be \"prediction--\", where timestamp is in YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ ISO-8601 format. The contents of it depends on the ML problem the predictions are made for. * For Image Classification: In the created directory files `image_classification_1.jsonl`, `image_classification_2.jsonl`,...,`image_classification_N.jsonl` will be created, where N may be 1, and depends on the total number of the successfully predicted images and annotations. A single image will be listed only once with all its annotations, and its annotations will never be split across files. Each .JSONL file will contain, per line, a JSON representation of a proto that wraps image's \"ID\" : \"\" followed by a list of zero or more AnnotationPayload protos (called annotations), which have classification detail populated. If prediction for any image failed (partially or completely), then an additional `errors_1.jsonl`, `errors_2.jsonl`,..., `errors_N.jsonl` files will be created (N depends on total number of failed predictions). These files will have a JSON representation of a proto that wraps the same \"ID\" : \"\" but here followed by exactly one [`google.rpc.Status`](https: //github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/status.proto) containing only `code` and `message`fields. * For Image Object Detection: In the created directory files `image_object_detection_1.jsonl`, `image_object_detection_2.jsonl`,...,`image_object_detection_N.jsonl` will be created, where N may be 1, and depends on the total number of the successfully predicted images and annotations. Each .JSONL file will contain, per line, a JSON representation of a proto that wraps image's \"ID\" : \"\" followed by a list of zero or more AnnotationPayload protos (called annotations), which have image_object_detection detail populated. A single image will be listed only once with all its annotations, and its annotations will never be split across files. If prediction for any image failed (partially or completely), then additional `errors_1.jsonl`, `errors_2.jsonl`,..., `errors_N.jsonl` files will be created (N depends on total number of failed predictions). These files will have a JSON representation of a proto that wraps the same \"ID\" : \"\" but here followed by exactly one [`google.rpc.Status`](https: //github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/status.proto) containing only `code` and `message`fields. * For Video Classification: In the created directory a video_classification.csv file, and a .JSON file per each video classification requested in the input (i.e. each line in given CSV(s)), will be created. The format of video_classification.csv is: GCS_FILE_PATH,TIME_SEGMENT_START,TIME_SEGMENT_END,JSON_FILE_NAME,STATUS where: GCS_FILE_PATH,TIME_SEGMENT_START,TIME_SEGMENT_END = matches 1 to 1 the prediction input lines (i.e. video_classification.csv has precisely the same number of lines as the prediction input had.) JSON_FILE_NAME = Name of .JSON file in the output directory, which contains prediction responses for the video time segment. STATUS = \"OK\" if prediction completed successfully, or an error code with message otherwise. If STATUS is not \"OK\" then the .JSON file for that line may not exist or be empty. Each .JSON file, assuming STATUS is \"OK\", will contain a list of AnnotationPayload protos in JSON format, which are the predictions for the video time segment the file is assigned to in the video_classification.csv. All AnnotationPayload protos will have video_classification field set, and will be sorted by video_classification.type field (note that the returned types are governed by `classifaction_types` parameter in PredictService.BatchPredictRequest.params). * For Video Object Tracking: In the created directory a video_object_tracking.csv file will be created, and multiple files video_object_trackinng_1.json, video_object_trackinng_2.json,..., video_object_trackinng_N.json, where N is the number of requests in the input (i.e. the number of lines in given CSV(s)). The format of video_object_tracking.csv is: GCS_FILE_PATH,TIME_SEGMENT_START,TIME_SEGMENT_END,JSON_FILE_NAME,STATUS where: GCS_FILE_PATH,TIME_SEGMENT_START,TIME_SEGMENT_END = matches 1 to 1 the prediction input lines (i.e. video_object_tracking.csv has precisely the same number of lines as the prediction input had.) JSON_FILE_NAME = Name of .JSON file in the output directory, which contains prediction responses for the video time segment. STATUS = \"OK\" if prediction completed successfully, or an error code with message otherwise. If STATUS is not \"OK\" then the .JSON file for that line may not exist or be empty. Each .JSON file, assuming STATUS is \"OK\", will contain a list of AnnotationPayload protos in JSON format, which are the predictions for each frame of the video time segment the file is assigned to in video_object_tracking.csv. All AnnotationPayload protos will have video_object_tracking field set. * For Text Classification: In the created directory files `text_classification_1.jsonl`, `text_classification_2.jsonl`,...,`text_classification_N.jsonl` will be created, where N may be 1, and depends on the total number of inputs and annotations found. Each .JSONL file will contain, per line, a JSON representation of a proto that wraps input text snippet or input text file and a list of zero or more AnnotationPayload protos (called annotations), which have classification detail populated. A single text snippet or file will be listed only once with all its annotations, and its annotations will never be split across files. If prediction for any text snippet or file failed (partially or completely), then additional `errors_1.jsonl`, `errors_2.jsonl`,..., `errors_N.jsonl` files will be created (N depends on total number of failed predictions). These files will have a JSON representation of a proto that wraps input text snippet or input text file followed by exactly one [`google.rpc.Status`](https: //github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/status.proto) containing only `code` and `message`. * For Text Sentiment: In the created directory files `text_sentiment_1.jsonl`, `text_sentiment_2.jsonl`,...,`text_sentiment_N.jsonl` will be created, where N may be 1, and depends on the total number of inputs and annotations found. Each .JSONL file will contain, per line, a JSON representation of a proto that wraps input text snippet or input text file and a list of zero or more AnnotationPayload protos (called annotations), which have text_sentiment detail populated. A single text snippet or file will be listed only once with all its annotations, and its annotations will never be split across files. If prediction for any text snippet or file failed (partially or completely), then additional `errors_1.jsonl`, `errors_2.jsonl`,..., `errors_N.jsonl` files will be created (N depends on total number of failed predictions). These files will have a JSON representation of a proto that wraps input text snippet or input text file followed by exactly one [`google.rpc.Status`](https: //github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/status.proto) containing only `code` and `message`. * For Text Extraction: In the created directory files `text_extraction_1.jsonl`, `text_extraction_2.jsonl`,...,`text_extraction_N.jsonl` will be created, where N may be 1, and depends on the total number of inputs and annotations found. The contents of these .JSONL file(s) depend on whether the input used inline text, or documents. If input was inline, then each .JSONL file will contain, per line, a JSON representation of a proto that wraps given in request text snippet's \"id\" (if specified), followed by input text snippet, and a list of zero or more AnnotationPayload protos (called annotations), which have text_extraction detail populated. A single text snippet will be listed only once with all its annotations, and its annotations will never be split across files. If input used documents, then each .JSONL file will contain, per line, a JSON representation of a proto that wraps given in request document proto, followed by its OCR-ed representation in the form of a text snippet, finally followed by a list of zero or more AnnotationPayload protos (called annotations), which have text_extraction detail populated and refer, via their indices, to the OCR-ed text snippet. A single document (and its text snippet) will be listed only once with all its annotations, and its annotations will never be split across files. If prediction for any text snippet failed (partially or completely), then additional `errors_1.jsonl`, `errors_2.jsonl`,..., `errors_N.jsonl` files will be created (N depends on total number of failed predictions). These files will have a JSON representation of a proto that wraps either the \"id\" : \"\" (in case of inline) or the document proto (in case of document) but here followed by exactly one [`google.rpc.Status`](https: //github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/status.proto) containing only `code` and `message`. * For Tables: Output depends on whether gcs_destination or bigquery_destination is set (either is allowed). GCS case: In the created directory files `tables_1.csv`, `tables_2.csv`,..., `tables_N.csv` will be created, where N may be 1, and depends on the total number of the successfully predicted rows. For all CLASSIFICATION prediction_type-s: Each .csv file will contain a header, listing all columns' display_name-s given on input followed by M target column names in the format of \"__score\" where M is the number of distinct target values, i.e. number of distinct values in the target column of the table used to train the model. Subsequent lines will contain the respective values of successfully predicted rows, with the last, i.e. the target, columns having the corresponding prediction scores. For REGRESSION and FORECASTING prediction_type-s: Each .csv file will contain a header, listing all columns' display_name-s given on input followed by the predicted target column with name in the format of \"predicted_\" Subsequent lines will contain the respective values of successfully predicted rows, with the last, i.e. the target, column having the predicted target value. If prediction for any rows failed, then an additional `errors_1.csv`, `errors_2.csv`,..., `errors_N.csv` will be created (N depends on total number of failed rows). These files will have analogous format as `tables_*.csv`, but always with a single target column having [`google.rpc.Status`](https: //github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/status.proto) represented as a JSON string, and containing only `code` and `message`. BigQuery case: bigquery_destination pointing to a BigQuery project must be set. In the given project a new dataset will be created with name `prediction__` where will be made BigQuery-dataset-name compatible (e.g. most special characters will become underscores), and timestamp will be in YYYY_MM_DDThh_mm_ss_sssZ \"based on ISO-8601\" format. In the dataset two tables will be created, `predictions`, and `errors`. The `predictions` table's column names will be the input columns' display_name-s followed by the target column with name in the format of \"predicted_\" The input feature columns will contain the respective values of successfully predicted rows, with the target column having an ARRAY of AnnotationPayloads, represented as STRUCT-s, containing TablesAnnotation. The `errors` table contains rows for which the prediction has failed, it has analogous input columns while the target column name is in the format of \"errors_\", and as a value has [`google.rpc.Status`](https: //github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/status.proto) represented as a STRUCT, and containing only `code` and `message`."

If an \"example\" file (that is, image, video etc.) with identical content (even if it had different GCS_FILE_PATH) is mentioned multiple times, then its label, bounding boxes etc. are appended. The same file should be always provided with the same ML_USE and GCS_FILE_PATH, if it is not, then these values are nondeterministically selected from the given ones. The formats are represented in EBNF with commas being literal and with non-terminal symbols defined near the end of this comment. The formats are: * For Image Classification: CSV file(s) with each line in format: ML_USE,GCS_FILE_PATH,LABEL,LABEL,... GCS_FILE_PATH leads to image of up to 30MB in size. Supported extensions: .JPEG, .GIF, .PNG, .WEBP, .BMP, .TIFF, .ICO For MULTICLASS classification type, at most one LABEL is allowed per image. If an image has not yet been labeled, then it should be mentioned just once with no LABEL. Some sample rows: TRAIN,gs://folder/image1.jpg,daisy TEST,gs://folder/image2.jpg,dandelion,tulip,rose UNASSIGNED,gs://folder/image3.jpg,daisy UNASSIGNED,gs://folder/image4.jpg * For Image Object Detection: CSV file(s) with each line in format: ML_USE,GCS_FILE_PATH,(LABEL,BOUNDING_BOX | ,,,,,,,) GCS_FILE_PATH leads to image of up to 30MB in size. Supported extensions: .JPEG, .GIF, .PNG. Each image is assumed to be exhaustively labeled. The minimum allowed BOUNDING_BOX edge length is 0.01, and no more than 500 BOUNDING_BOX-es per image are allowed (one BOUNDING_BOX is defined per line). If an image has not yet been labeled, then it should be mentioned just once with no LABEL and the \",,,,,,,\" in place of the BOUNDING_BOX. For images which are known to not contain any bounding boxes, they should be labelled explictly as \"NEGATIVE_IMAGE\", followed by \",,,,,,,\" in place of the BOUNDING_BOX.

The GCS_FILE_PATH should lead to another .csv file which describes examples that have given ML_USE, using the following row format: GCS_FILE_PATH,(LABEL,TIME_SEGMENT_START,TIME_SEGMENT_END | ,,) Here GCS_FILE_PATH leads to a video of up to 50GB in size and up to 3h duration. Supported extensions: .MOV, .MPEG4, .MP4, .AVI. TIME_SEGMENT_START and TIME_SEGMENT_END must be within the length of the video, and end has to be after the start. Any segment of a video which has one or more labels on it, is considered a hard negative for all other labels. Any segment with no labels on it is considered to be unknown. If a whole video is unknown, then it shuold be mentioned just once with \",,\" in place of LABEL, TIME_SEGMENT_START,TIME_SEGMENT_END.

The GCS_FILE_PATH should lead to another .csv file which describes examples that have given ML_USE, using one of the following row format: GCS_FILE_PATH,LABEL,[INSTANCE_ID],TIMESTAMP,BOUNDING_BOX or GCS_FILE_PATH,,,,,,,,,, Here GCS_FILE_PATH leads to a video of up to 50GB in size and up to 3h duration. Supported extensions: .MOV, .MPEG4, .MP4, .AVI. Providing INSTANCE_IDs can help to obtain a better model. When a specific labeled entity leaves the video frame, and shows up afterwards it is not required, albeit preferable, that the same INSTANCE_ID is given to it. TIMESTAMP must be within the length of the video, the BOUNDING_BOX is assumed to be drawn on the closest video's frame to the TIMESTAMP. Any mentioned by the TIMESTAMP frame is expected to be exhaustively labeled and no more than 500 BOUNDING_BOX-es per frame are allowed. If a whole video is unknown, then it should be mentioned just once with \",,,,,,,,,,\" in place of LABEL, [INSTANCE_ID],TIMESTAMP,BOUNDING_BOX.

Any given .JSONL file must be 100MB or smaller. The in-line .JSONL file contains, per line, a proto that wraps a TextSnippet proto (in json representation) followed by one or more AnnotationPayload protos (called annotations), which have display_name and text_extraction detail populated. The given text is expected to be annotated exhaustively, for example, if you look for animals and text contains \"dolphin\" that is not labeled, then \"dolphin\" is assumed to not be an animal. Any given text snippet content must be 10KB or smaller, and also be UTF-8 NFC encoded (ASCII already is). The document .JSONL file contains, per line, a proto that wraps a Document proto. The Document proto must have either document_text or input_config set. In document_text case, the Document proto may also contain the spatial information of the document, including layout, document dimension and page number. In input_config case, only PDF documents are supported now, and each document may be up to 2MB large. Currently, annotations on documents cannot be specified at import.

TEXT_SNIPPET and GCS_FILE_PATH are distinguished by a pattern. If the column content is a valid gcs file path, i.e. prefixed by \"gs://\", it will be treated as a GCS_FILE_PATH, else if the content is enclosed within double quotes (\"\"), it is treated as a TEXT_SNIPPET. In the GCS_FILE_PATH case, the path must lead to a .txt file with UTF-8 encoding, for example, \"gs://folder/content.txt\", and the content in it is extracted as a text snippet. In TEXT_SNIPPET case, the column content excluding quotes is treated as to be imported text snippet. In both cases, the text snippet/file size must be within 128kB. Maximum 100 unique labels are allowed per CSV row. Sample rows: TRAIN,\"They have bad food and very rude\",RudeService,BadFood TRAIN,gs://folder/content.txt,SlowService TEST,\"Typically always bad service there.\",RudeService VALIDATE,\"Stomach ache to go.\",BadFood * For Text Sentiment: CSV file(s) with each line in format: ML_USE,(TEXT_SNIPPET | GCS_FILE_PATH),SENTIMENT TEXT_SNIPPET and GCS_FILE_PATH are distinguished by a pattern. If the column content is a valid gcs file path, that is, prefixed by \"gs://\", it is treated as a GCS_FILE_PATH, otherwise it is treated as a TEXT_SNIPPET. In the GCS_FILE_PATH case, the path must lead to a .txt file with UTF-8 encoding, for example, \"gs://folder/content.txt\", and the content in it is extracted as a text snippet. In TEXT_SNIPPET case, the column content itself is treated as to be imported text snippet. In both cases, the text snippet must be up to 500 characters long. Sample rows: TRAIN,\"@freewrytin this is way too good for your product\",2 TRAIN,\"I need this product so bad\",3 TEST,\"Thank you for this product.\",4 VALIDATE,gs://folder/content.txt,2 * For Tables: Either gcs_source or bigquery_source can be used. All inputs is concatenated into a single primary_table For gcs_source: CSV file(s), where the first row of the first file is the header, containing unique column names. If the first row of a subsequent file is the same as the header, then it is also treated as a header. All other rows contain values for the corresponding columns. Each .CSV file by itself must be 10GB or smaller, and their total size must be 100GB or smaller. First three sample rows of a CSV file: \"Id\",\"First Name\",\"Last Name\",\"Dob\",\"Addresses\" \"1\",\"John\",\"Doe\",\"1968-01-22\",\"[{\"status\":\"current\",\"address\":\"123_First_Avenue\",\"city\":\"Seattle\",\"state\":\"WA\",\"zip\":\"11111\",\"numberOfYears\":\"1\"},{\"status\":\"previous\",\"address\":\"456_Main_Street\",\"city\":\"Portland\",\"state\":\"OR\",\"zip\":\"22222\",\"numberOfYears\":\"5\"}]\" \"2\",\"Jane\",\"Doe\",\"1980-10-16\",\"[{\"status\":\"current\",\"address\":\"789_Any_Avenue\",\"city\":\"Albany\",\"state\":\"NY\",\"zip\":\"33333\",\"numberOfYears\":\"2\"},{\"status\":\"previous\",\"address\":\"321_Main_Street\",\"city\":\"Hoboken\",\"state\":\"NJ\",\"zip\":\"44444\",\"numberOfYears\":\"3\"}]} For bigquery_source: An URI of a BigQuery table. The user data size of the BigQuery table must be 100GB or smaller. An imported table must have between 2 and 1,000 columns, inclusive, and between 1000 and 100,000,000 rows, inclusive. There are at most 5 import data running in parallel. Definitions: ML_USE = \"TRAIN\" | \"VALIDATE\" | \"TEST\" | \"UNASSIGNED\" Describes how the given example (file) should be used for model training. \"UNASSIGNED\" can be used when user has no preference. GCS_FILE_PATH = A path to file on GCS, e.g. \"gs://folder/image1.png\". LABEL = A display name of an object on an image, video etc., e.g. \"dog\". Must be up to 32 characters long and can consist only of ASCII Latin letters A-Z and a-z, underscores(_), and ASCII digits 0-9. For each label an AnnotationSpec is created which display_name becomes the label; AnnotationSpecs are given back in predictions. INSTANCE_ID = A positive integer that identifies a specific instance of a labeled entity on an example. Used e.g. to track two cars on a video while being able to tell apart which one is which. BOUNDING_BOX = VERTEX,VERTEX,VERTEX,VERTEX | VERTEX,,,VERTEX,, A rectangle parallel to the frame of the example (image, video). If 4 vertices are given they are connected by edges in the order provided, if 2 are given they are recognized as diagonally opposite vertices of the rectangle. VERTEX = COORDINATE,COORDINATE First coordinate is horizontal (x), the second is vertical (y). COORDINATE = A float in 0 to 1 range, relative to total length of image or video in given dimension. For fractions the leading non-decimal 0 can be omitted (i.e. 0.3 = .3). Point 0,0 is in top left. TIME_SEGMENT_START = TIME_OFFSET Expresses a beginning, inclusive, of a time segment within an example that has a time dimension (e.g. video). TIME_SEGMENT_END = TIME_OFFSET Expresses an end, exclusive, of a time segment within an example that has a time dimension (e.g. video). TIME_OFFSET = A number of seconds as measured from the start of an example (e.g. video). Fractions are allowed, up to a microsecond precision. \"inf\" is allowed, and it means the end of the example. TEXT_SNIPPET = A content of a text snippet, UTF-8 encoded, enclosed within double quotes (\"\"). SENTIMENT = An integer between 0 and Dataset.text_sentiment_dataset_metadata.sentiment_max (inclusive). Describes the ordinal of the sentiment - higher value means a more positive sentiment. All the values are completely relative, i.e. neither 0 needs to mean a negative or neutral sentiment nor sentiment_max needs to mean a positive one - it is just required that 0 is the least positive sentiment in the data, and sentiment_max is the most positive one. The SENTIMENT shouldn't be confused with \"score\" or \"magnitude\" from the previous Natural Language Sentiment Analysis API. All SENTIMENT values between 0 and sentiment_max must be represented in the imported data. On prediction the same 0 to sentiment_max range will be used. The difference between neighboring sentiment values needs not to be uniform, e.g. 1 and 2 may be similar whereas the difference between 2 and 3 may be huge. Errors: If any of the provided CSV files can't be parsed or if more than certain percent of CSV rows cannot be processed then the operation fails and nothing is imported. Regardless of overall success or failure the per-row failures, up to a certain count cap, is listed in Operation.metadata.partial_failures. "

    Policy:
      description: "An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\", } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/)."

Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits.
