# DeploymentsCancelPreviewRequest


## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**fingerprint** | **bytearray** | Specifies a fingerprint for &#x60;cancelPreview()&#x60; requests. A fingerprint is a randomly generated value that must be provided in &#x60;cancelPreview()&#x60; requests to perform optimistic locking. This ensures optimistic concurrency so that the deployment does not have conflicting requests (e.g. if someone attempts to make a new update request while another user attempts to cancel a preview, this would prevent one of the requests). The fingerprint is initially generated by Deployment Manager and changes after every request to modify a deployment. To get the latest fingerprint value, perform a &#x60;get()&#x60; request on the deployment. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.deployments_cancel_preview_request import DeploymentsCancelPreviewRequest

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of DeploymentsCancelPreviewRequest from a JSON string
deployments_cancel_preview_request_instance = DeploymentsCancelPreviewRequest.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(DeploymentsCancelPreviewRequest.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
deployments_cancel_preview_request_dict = deployments_cancel_preview_request_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of DeploymentsCancelPreviewRequest from a dict
deployments_cancel_preview_request_from_dict = DeploymentsCancelPreviewRequest.from_dict(deployments_cancel_preview_request_dict)
