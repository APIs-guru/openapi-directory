# DeploymentsStopRequest


## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**fingerprint** | **bytearray** | Specifies a fingerprint for &#x60;stop()&#x60; requests. A fingerprint is a randomly generated value that must be provided in &#x60;stop()&#x60; requests to perform optimistic locking. This ensures optimistic concurrency so that the deployment does not have conflicting requests (e.g. if someone attempts to make a new update request while another user attempts to stop an ongoing update request, this would prevent a collision). The fingerprint is initially generated by Deployment Manager and changes after every request to modify a deployment. To get the latest fingerprint value, perform a &#x60;get()&#x60; request on the deployment. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.deployments_stop_request import DeploymentsStopRequest

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of DeploymentsStopRequest from a JSON string
deployments_stop_request_instance = DeploymentsStopRequest.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(DeploymentsStopRequest.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
deployments_stop_request_dict = deployments_stop_request_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of DeploymentsStopRequest from a dict
deployments_stop_request_from_dict = DeploymentsStopRequest.from_dict(deployments_stop_request_dict)
