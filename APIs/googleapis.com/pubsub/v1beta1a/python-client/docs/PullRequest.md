Request for the Pull method.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**return_immediately** | **bool** | If this is specified as true the system will respond immediately even if it is not able to return a message in the Pull response. Otherwise the system is allowed to wait until at least one message is available rather than returning FAILED_PRECONDITION. The client may cancel the request if it does not wish to wait any longer for the response. | [optional] 
**subscription** | **str** | The subscription from which a message should be pulled. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.pull_request import PullRequest

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of PullRequest from a JSON string
pull_request_instance = PullRequest.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(PullRequest.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
pull_request_dict = pull_request_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of PullRequest from a dict
pull_request_from_dict = PullRequest.from_dict(pull_request_dict)
