# VulnerabilityNote

A security vulnerability that can be found in resources.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**cvss_score** | **float** | The CVSS score of this vulnerability. CVSS score is on a scale of 0 - 10 where 0 indicates low severity and 10 indicates high severity. | [optional] 
**cvss_v2** | [**CVSS**](CVSS.md) |  | [optional] 
**cvss_v3** | [**CVSSv3**](CVSSv3.md) |  | [optional] 
**cvss_version** | **str** | CVSS version used to populate cvss_score and severity. | [optional] 
**details** | [**List[Detail]**](Detail.md) | Details of all known distros and packages affected by this vulnerability. | [optional] 
**severity** | **str** | The note provider assigned severity of this vulnerability. | [optional] 
**source_update_time** | **str** | The time this information was last changed at the source. This is an upstream timestamp from the underlying information source - e.g. Ubuntu security tracker. | [optional] 
**windows_details** | [**List[WindowsDetail]**](WindowsDetail.md) | Windows details get their own format because the information format and model don&#39;t match a normal detail. Specifically Windows updates are done as patches, thus Windows vulnerabilities really are a missing package, rather than a package being at an incorrect version. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.vulnerability_note import VulnerabilityNote

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of VulnerabilityNote from a JSON string
vulnerability_note_instance = VulnerabilityNote.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(VulnerabilityNote.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
vulnerability_note_dict = vulnerability_note_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of VulnerabilityNote from a dict
vulnerability_note_from_dict = VulnerabilityNote.from_dict(vulnerability_note_dict)
