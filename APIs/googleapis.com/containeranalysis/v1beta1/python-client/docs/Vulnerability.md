# Vulnerability

Vulnerability provides metadata about a security vulnerability in a Note.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**cvss_score** | **float** | The CVSS score for this vulnerability. | [optional] 
**cvss_v2** | [**CVSS**](CVSS.md) |  | [optional] 
**cvss_v3** | [**CVSSv3**](CVSSv3.md) |  | [optional] 
**cvss_version** | **str** | CVSS version used to populate cvss_score and severity. | [optional] 
**cwe** | **List[str]** | A list of CWE for this vulnerability. For details, see: https://cwe.mitre.org/index.html | [optional] 
**details** | [**List[Detail]**](Detail.md) | All information about the package to specifically identify this vulnerability. One entry per (version range and cpe_uri) the package vulnerability has manifested in. | [optional] 
**severity** | **str** | Note provider assigned impact of the vulnerability. | [optional] 
**source_update_time** | **str** | The time this information was last changed at the source. This is an upstream timestamp from the underlying information source - e.g. Ubuntu security tracker. | [optional] 
**windows_details** | [**List[WindowsDetail]**](WindowsDetail.md) | Windows details get their own format because the information format and model don&#39;t match a normal detail. Specifically Windows updates are done as patches, thus Windows vulnerabilities really are a missing package, rather than a package being at an incorrect version. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.vulnerability import Vulnerability

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Vulnerability from a JSON string
vulnerability_instance = Vulnerability.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(Vulnerability.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
vulnerability_dict = vulnerability_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Vulnerability from a dict
vulnerability_from_dict = Vulnerability.from_dict(vulnerability_dict)
```
