# VulnerabilityCheck

An image vulnerability check, which rejects images that violate the configured vulnerability rules.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**allowed_cves** | **List[str]** | Optional. A list of specific CVEs to ignore even if the vulnerability level violates &#x60;maximumUnfixableSeverity&#x60; or &#x60;maximumFixableSeverity&#x60;. CVEs are listed in the format of Container Analysis note id. For example: - CVE-2021-20305 - CVE-2020-10543 The CVEs are applicable regardless of note provider project, e.g., an entry of &#x60;CVE-2021-20305&#x60; will allow vulnerabilities with a note name of either &#x60;projects/goog-vulnz/notes/CVE-2021-20305&#x60; or &#x60;projects/CUSTOM-PROJECT/notes/CVE-2021-20305&#x60;. | [optional] 
**blocked_cves** | **List[str]** | Optional. A list of specific CVEs to always raise warnings about even if the vulnerability level meets &#x60;maximumUnfixableSeverity&#x60; or &#x60;maximumFixableSeverity&#x60;. CVEs are listed in the format of Container Analysis note id. For example: - CVE-2021-20305 - CVE-2020-10543 The CVEs are applicable regardless of note provider project, e.g., an entry of &#x60;CVE-2021-20305&#x60; will block vulnerabilities with a note name of either &#x60;projects/goog-vulnz/notes/CVE-2021-20305&#x60; or &#x60;projects/CUSTOM-PROJECT/notes/CVE-2021-20305&#x60;. | [optional] 
**container_analysis_vulnerability_projects** | **List[str]** | Optional. The projects where vulnerabilities are stored as Container Analysis Occurrences. Each project is expressed in the resource format of &#x60;projects/[PROJECT_ID]&#x60;, e.g., &#x60;projects/my-gcp-project&#x60;. An attempt will be made for each project to fetch vulnerabilities, and all valid vulnerabilities will be used to check against the vulnerability policy. If no valid scan is found in all projects configured here, an error will be returned for the check. Maximum number of &#x60;container_analysis_vulnerability_projects&#x60; allowed in each &#x60;VulnerabilityCheck&#x60; is 10. | [optional] 
**maximum_fixable_severity** | **str** | Required. The threshold for severity for which a fix is currently available. This field is required and must be set. | [optional] 
**maximum_unfixable_severity** | **str** | Required. The threshold for severity for which a fix isn&#39;t currently available. This field is required and must be set. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.vulnerability_check import VulnerabilityCheck

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of VulnerabilityCheck from a JSON string
vulnerability_check_instance = VulnerabilityCheck.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(VulnerabilityCheck.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
vulnerability_check_dict = vulnerability_check_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of VulnerabilityCheck from a dict
vulnerability_check_from_dict = VulnerabilityCheck.from_dict(vulnerability_check_dict)
