    IamPolicy:
      description: "An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\", } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/)."

          description: Output only. This field will contain the service account email address that this Attestor will use as the principal when querying Container Analysis. Attestor administrators must grant this service account the IAM role needed to read attestations from the note_reference in Container Analysis (`containeranalysis.notes.occurrences.viewer`). This email address is fixed for the lifetime of the Attestor, but callers should not make any other assumptions about the service account email; future versions may use an email based on a different naming pattern.

          description: "Required. The Drydock resource name of a ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY Note, created by the user, in the format: `projects/*/notes/*` (or the legacy `providers/*/notes/*`). This field may not be updated. An attestation by this attestor is stored as a Drydock ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY Occurrence that names a container image and that links to this Note. Drydock is an external dependency."

If this field is non-empty, one of the specified public keys must verify that an attestation was signed by this attestor for the image specified in the admission request. If this field is empty, this attestor always returns that no valid attestations exist.
