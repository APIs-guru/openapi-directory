## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**condition** | [**Expr**](Expr.md) |  | [optional] 
**members** | **List[str]** | Specifies the principals requesting access for a Google Cloud resource. members can have the following values: allUsers: A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with or without a Google account. allAuthenticatedUsers: A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account. Does not include identities that come from external identity providers (IdPs) through identity federation. user:{emailid}: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, alice@example.com . serviceAccount:{emailid}: An email address that represents a Google service account. For example, my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com. serviceAccount:{projectid}.svc.id.goog[{namespace}/{kubernetes-sa}]: An identifier for a Kubernetes service account (https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/kubernetes-service-accounts). For example, my-project.svc.id.goog[my-namespace/my-kubernetes-sa]. group:{emailid}: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, admins@example.com. domain:{domain}: The G Suite domain (primary) that represents all the users of that domain. For example, google.com or example.com. principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/subject/{subject_attribute_value}: A single identity in a workforce identity pool. principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/group/{group_id}: All workforce identities in a group. principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/attribute.{attribute_name}/{attribute_value}: All workforce identities with a specific attribute value. principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/*: All identities in a workforce identity pool. principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project_number}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/subject/{subject_attribute_value}: A single identity in a workload identity pool. principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project_number}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/group/{group_id}: A workload identity pool group. principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project_number}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/attribute.{attribute_name}/{attribute_value}: All identities in a workload identity pool with a certain attribute. principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project_number}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/*: All identities in a workload identity pool. deleted:user:{emailid}?uid&#x3D;{uniqueid}: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For example, alice@example.com?uid&#x3D;123456789012345678901. If the user is recovered, this value reverts to user:{emailid} and the recovered user retains the role in the binding. deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid&#x3D;{uniqueid}: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a service account that has been recently deleted. For example, my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid&#x3D;123456789012345678901. If the service account is undeleted, this value reverts to serviceAccount:{emailid} and the undeleted service account retains the role in the binding. deleted:group:{emailid}?uid&#x3D;{uniqueid}: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a Google group that has been recently deleted. For example, admins@example.com?uid&#x3D;123456789012345678901. If the group is recovered, this value reverts to group:{emailid} and the recovered group retains the role in the binding. deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/subject/{subject_attribute_value}: Deleted single identity in a workforce identity pool. For example, deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/my-pool-id/subject/my-subject-attribute-value. | [optional] 
**role** | **str** | Role that is assigned to the list of members, or principals. For example, roles/viewer, roles/editor, or roles/owner.For an overview of the IAM roles and permissions, see the IAM documentation (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview). For a list of the available pre-defined roles, see here (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles). | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.binding import Binding

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Binding from a JSON string
binding_instance = Binding.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(Binding.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
binding_dict = binding_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Binding from a dict
binding_from_dict = Binding.from_dict(binding_dict)
