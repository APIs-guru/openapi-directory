# DelayedEvent

An event generated whenever a resource limitation or transient error delays execution of a pipeline that was otherwise ready to run.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**cause** | **str** | A textual description of the cause of the delay. The string can change without notice because it is often generated by another service (such as Compute Engine). | [optional] 
**metrics** | **List[str]** | If the delay was caused by a resource shortage, this field lists the Compute Engine metrics that are preventing this operation from running (for example, &#x60;CPUS&#x60; or &#x60;INSTANCES&#x60;). If the particular metric is not known, a single &#x60;UNKNOWN&#x60; metric will be present. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.delayed_event import DelayedEvent

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of DelayedEvent from a JSON string
delayed_event_instance = DelayedEvent.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(DelayedEvent.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
delayed_event_dict = delayed_event_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of DelayedEvent from a dict
delayed_event_from_dict = DelayedEvent.from_dict(delayed_event_dict)
