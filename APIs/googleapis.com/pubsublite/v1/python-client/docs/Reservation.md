# Reservation

Metadata about a reservation resource.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**name** | **str** | The name of the reservation. Structured like: projects/{project_number}/locations/{location}/reservations/{reservation_id} | [optional] 
**throughput_capacity** | **str** | The reserved throughput capacity. Every unit of throughput capacity is equivalent to 1 MiB/s of published messages or 2 MiB/s of subscribed messages. Any topics which are declared as using capacity from a Reservation will consume resources from this reservation instead of being charged individually. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.reservation import Reservation

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Reservation from a JSON string
reservation_instance = Reservation.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(Reservation.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
reservation_dict = reservation_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Reservation from a dict
reservation_from_dict = Reservation.from_dict(reservation_dict)
```
