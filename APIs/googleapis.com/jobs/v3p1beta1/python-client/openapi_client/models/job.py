If a job has more locations, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with unique requisition_ids (e.g. 'ReqA' becomes 'ReqA-1', 'ReqA-2', etc.) as multiple jobs with the same company_name, language_code and requisition_id are not allowed. If the original requisition_id must be preserved, a custom field should be used for storage. It is also suggested to group the locations that close to each other in the same job for better search experience. Jobs with multiple addresses must have their addresses with the same LocationType to allow location filtering to work properly.
