Specifying the full street address(es) of the hiring location enables better API results, especially job searches by commute time. At most 50 locations are allowed for best search performance. If a job has more locations, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with unique requisition_ids (e.g. 'ReqA' becomes 'ReqA-1', 'ReqA-2', etc.) as multiple jobs with the same company_name, language_code and requisition_id are not allowed. If the original requisition_id must be preserved, a custom field should be used for storage. It is also suggested to group the locations that close to each other in the same job for better search experience. Jobs with multiple addresses must have their addresses with the same LocationType to allow location filtering to work properly. (For example, a Job with addresses "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, USA" and "London, UK" may not have location filters applied correctly at search time since the first is a LocationType.STREET_ADDRESS and the second is a LocationType.LOCALITY.)

        postingExpireTime:
          description: Optional but strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can't be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company_name, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are cleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. Timestamp before the instant request is made is considered valid, the job will be treated as expired immediately. If this value is not provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include expiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn't updated.

If not set or set to TelecommutePreference.TELECOMMUTE_EXCLUDED, the telecommute status of the jobs is ignored. Jobs that have PostingRegion.TELECOMMUTE and have additional Job.addresses may still be matched based on other location filters using address or latlng. This filter can be used by itself to search exclusively for telecommuting jobs, or it can be combined with another location filter to search for a combination of job locations, such as "Mountain View" or "telecommuting" jobs. However, when used in combination with other location filters, telecommuting jobs can be treated as less relevant than other jobs in the search response.

It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478"

          description: Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. "Austin, TX"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be "envelope order" for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. "ja" for large-to-small ordering and "ja-Latn" or "en" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations.

          description: Optional. Controls whether to disable exact keyword match on Job.job_title, Job.description, Job.company_display_name, Job.locations, Job.qualifications. When disable keyword match is turned off, a keyword match returns jobs that do not match given category filters when there are matching keywords. For example, the query "program manager," a result is returned even if the job posting has the title "software developer," which does not fall into "program manager" ontology, but does have "program manager" appearing in its description. For queries like "cloud" that does not contain title or location specific ontology, jobs with "cloud" keyword matches are returned regardless of this flag's value. Please use Company.keyword_searchable_custom_fields or Company.keyword_searchable_custom_attributes if company specific globally matched custom field/attribute string values is needed.
