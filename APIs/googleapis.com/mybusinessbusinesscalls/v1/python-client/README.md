# openapi-client
The My Business Business Calls API manages business calls information of a location on Google and collect insights like the number of missed calls to their location. Additional information about Business calls can be found at https://support.google.com/business/answer/9688285?p=call_history. If the Google Business Profile links to a Google Ads account and call history is turned on, calls that last longer than a specific time, and that can be attributed to an ad interaction, will show in the linked Google Ads account under the \"Calls from Ads\" conversion. If smart bidding and call conversions are used in the optimization strategy, there could be a change in ad spend. Learn more about smart bidding. To view and perform actions on a location's calls, you need to be a `OWNER`, `CO_OWNER` or `MANAGER` of the location. Note - If you have a quota of 0 after enabling the API, please request for GBP API access.

## Requirements.

Python 3.7+

## Installation & Usage
### pip install

If the python package is hosted on a repository, you can install directly using:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID.git
```
(you may need to run `pip` with root permission: `sudo pip install git+https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID.git`)

Then import the package:
```python
import openapi_client
```

### Setuptools

Install via [Setuptools](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools).

```sh
python setup.py install --user
```
(or `sudo python setup.py install` to install the package for all users)

Then import the package:
```python
import openapi_client
```

### Tests

Execute `pytest` to run the tests.

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation procedure](#installation--usage) and then run the following:

```python

import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://mybusinessbusinesscalls.googleapis.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://mybusinessbusinesscalls.googleapis.com"
)



# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.LocationsApi(api_client)
    parent = 'parent_example' # str | Required. The parent location to fetch calls insights for. Format: locations/{location_id}
    xgafv = 'xgafv_example' # str | V1 error format. (optional)
    access_token = 'access_token_example' # str | OAuth access token. (optional)
    alt = 'alt_example' # str | Data format for response. (optional)
    param_callback = 'param_callback_example' # str | JSONP (optional)
    fields = 'fields_example' # str | Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response. (optional)
    key = 'key_example' # str | API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token. (optional)
    oauth_token = 'oauth_token_example' # str | OAuth 2.0 token for the current user. (optional)
    pretty_print = True # bool | Returns response with indentations and line breaks. (optional)
    quota_user = 'quota_user_example' # str | Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters. (optional)
    upload_protocol = 'upload_protocol_example' # str | Upload protocol for media (e.g. \"raw\", \"multipart\"). (optional)
    upload_type = 'upload_type_example' # str | Legacy upload protocol for media (e.g. \"media\", \"multipart\"). (optional)
    filter = 'filter_example' # str | Optional. A filter constraining the calls insights to return. The response includes only entries that match the filter. If the MetricType is not provided, AGGREGATE_COUNT is returned. If no end_date is provided, the last date for which data is available is used. If no start_date is provided, we will default to the first date for which data is available, which is currently 6 months. If start_date is before the date when data is available, data is returned starting from the date when it is available. At this time we support following filters. 1. start_date=\"DATE\" where date is in YYYY-MM-DD format. 2. end_date=\"DATE\" where date is in YYYY-MM-DD format. 3. metric_type=XYZ where XYZ is a valid MetricType. 4. Conjunctions(AND) of all of the above. e.g., \"start_date=2021-08-01 AND end_date=2021-08-10 AND metric_type=AGGREGATE_COUNT\" The AGGREGATE_COUNT metric_type ignores the DD part of the date. (optional)
    page_size = 56 # int | Optional. The maximum number of BusinessCallsInsights to return. If unspecified, at most 20 will be returned. Some of the metric_types(e.g, AGGREGATE_COUNT) returns a single page. For these metrics, the page_size is ignored. (optional)
    page_token = 'page_token_example' # str | Optional. A page token, received from a previous `ListBusinessCallsInsights` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListBusinessCallsInsights` must match the call that provided the page token. Some of the metric_types (e.g, AGGREGATE_COUNT) returns a single page. For these metrics, the pake_token is ignored. (optional)

    try:
        api_response = api_instance.mybusinessbusinesscalls_locations_businesscallsinsights_list(parent, xgafv=xgafv, access_token=access_token, alt=alt, param_callback=param_callback, fields=fields, key=key, oauth_token=oauth_token, pretty_print=pretty_print, quota_user=quota_user, upload_protocol=upload_protocol, upload_type=upload_type, filter=filter, page_size=page_size, page_token=page_token)
        print("The response of LocationsApi->mybusinessbusinesscalls_locations_businesscallsinsights_list:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling LocationsApi->mybusinessbusinesscalls_locations_businesscallsinsights_list: %s\n" % e)

```
