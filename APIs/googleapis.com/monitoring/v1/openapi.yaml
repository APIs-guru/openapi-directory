    Aggregation:
      description: Describes how to combine multiple time series to provide a different view of the data. Aggregation of time series is done in two steps. First, each time series in the set is aligned to the same time interval boundaries, then the set of time series is optionally reduced in number.Alignment consists of applying the per_series_aligner operation to each time series after its data has been divided into regular alignment_period time intervals. This process takes all of the data points in an alignment period, applies a mathematical transformation such as averaging, minimum, maximum, delta, etc., and converts them into a single data point per period.Reduction is when the aligned and transformed time series can optionally be combined, reducing the number of time series through similar mathematical transformations. Reduction involves applying a cross_series_reducer to all the time series, optionally sorting the time series into subsets with group_by_fields, and applying the reducer to each subset.The raw time series data can contain a huge amount of information from multiple sources. Alignment and reduction transforms this mass of data into a more manageable and representative collection of data, for example "the 95% latency across the average of all tasks in a cluster". This representative data can be more easily graphed and comprehended, and the individual time series data is still available for later drilldown. For more details, see Filtering and aggregation (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/aggregation).
      properties:
        alignmentPeriod:
          description: The alignment_period specifies a time interval, in seconds, that is used to divide the data in all the time series into consistent blocks of time. This will be done before the per-series aligner can be applied to the data.The value must be at least 60 seconds. If a per-series aligner other than ALIGN_NONE is specified, this field is required or an error is returned. If no per-series aligner is specified, or the aligner ALIGN_NONE is specified, then this field is ignored.The maximum value of the alignment_period is 2 years, or 104 weeks.

The valid choices depend on the metric_kind and the value_type of the original time series. Reduction can yield a time series with a different metric_kind or value_type than the input time series.Time series data must first be aligned (see per_series_aligner) in order to perform cross-time series reduction. If cross_series_reducer is specified, then per_series_aligner must be specified, and must not be ALIGN_NONE. An alignment_period must also be specified; otherwise, an error is returned.

Each subset contains time series that have the same value for each of the grouping fields. Each individual time series is a member of exactly one subset. The cross_series_reducer is applied to each subset of time series. It is not possible to reduce across different resource types, so this field implicitly contains resource.type. Fields not specified in group_by_fields are aggregated away. If group_by_fields is not specified and all the time series have the same resource type, then the time series are aggregated into a single output time series. If cross_series_reducer is not defined, this field is ignored.

The valid choices depend on the metric_kind and value_type of the original time series. Alignment can change the metric_kind or the value_type of the time series.Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time series reduction.

(Danger trumps warning.)As an example, consider a scorecard with the following four thresholds: { value: 90, category: 'DANGER', trigger: 'ABOVE', }, { value: 70, category: 'WARNING', trigger: 'ABOVE', }, { value: 10, category: 'DANGER', trigger: 'BELOW', }, { value: 20, category: 'WARNING', trigger: 'BELOW', }Then: values less than or equal to 10 would put the scorecard in a DANGER state, values greater than 10 but less than or equal to 20 a WARNING state, values strictly between 20 and 70 an OK state, values greater than or equal to 70 but less than 90 a WARNING state, and values greater than or equal to 90 a DANGER state."
