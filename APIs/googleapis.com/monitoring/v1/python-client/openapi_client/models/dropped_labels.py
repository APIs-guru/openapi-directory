    A set of (label, value) pairs that were removed from a Distribution time series during aggregation and then added as an attachment to a Distribution.Exemplar.The full label set for the exemplars is constructed by using the dropped pairs in combination with the label values that remain on the aggregated Distribution time series. The constructed full label set can be used to identify the specific entity, such as the instance or job, which might be contributing to a long-tail. However, with dropped labels, the storage requirements are reduced because only the aggregated distribution values for a large group of time series are stored.Note that there are no guarantees on ordering of the labels from exemplar-to-exemplar and from distribution-to-distribution in the same stream, and there may be duplicates. It is up to clients to resolve any ambiguities.
