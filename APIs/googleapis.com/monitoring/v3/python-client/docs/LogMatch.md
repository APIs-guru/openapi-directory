# LogMatch

A condition type that checks whether a log message in the scoping project (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3#project_name) satisfies the given filter. Logs from other projects in the metrics scope are not evaluated.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**filter** | **str** | Required. A logs-based filter. See Advanced Logs Queries (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries) for how this filter should be constructed. | [optional] 
**label_extractors** | **Dict[str, str]** | Optional. A map from a label key to an extractor expression, which is used to extract the value for this label key. Each entry in this map is a specification for how data should be extracted from log entries that match filter. Each combination of extracted values is treated as a separate rule for the purposes of triggering notifications. Label keys and corresponding values can be used in notifications generated by this condition.Please see the documentation on logs-based metric valueExtractors (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/projects.metrics#LogMetric.FIELDS.value_extractor) for syntax and examples. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.log_match import LogMatch

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of LogMatch from a JSON string
log_match_instance = LogMatch.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(LogMatch.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
log_match_dict = log_match_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of LogMatch from a dict
log_match_from_dict = LogMatch.from_dict(log_match_dict)
