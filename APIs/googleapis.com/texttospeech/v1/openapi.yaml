            fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0

            set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A
            value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the
            normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at
            approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude.
            Strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective
            increase in loudness for any value greater than that.
