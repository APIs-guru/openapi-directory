      description: Pulls and returns a notification set for the enterprises associated with the service account authenticated for the request. The notification set may be empty if no notification are pending. A notification set returned needs to be acknowledged within 20 seconds by calling Enterprises.AcknowledgeNotificationSet, unless the notification set is empty. Notifications that are not acknowledged within the 20 seconds will eventually be included again in the response to another PullNotificationSet request, and those that are never acknowledged will ultimately be deleted according to the Google Cloud Platform Pub/Sub system policy. Multiple requests might be performed concurrently to retrieve notifications, in which case the pending notifications (if any) will be split among each caller, if any are pending. If no notifications are present, an empty notification list is returned. Subsequent requests may return more notifications once they become available.

The service account is unique to this enterprise and EMM, and will be deleted if the enterprise is unbound. The credentials contain private key data and are not stored server-side. This method can only be called after calling Enterprises.Enroll or Enterprises.CompleteSignup, and before Enterprises.SetAccount; at other times it will return an error. Subsequent calls after the first will generate a new, unique set of credentials, and invalidate the previously generated credentials. Once the service account is bound to the enterprise, it can be managed using the serviceAccountKeys resource.

    Entitlement:
      description: The presence of an Entitlements resource indicates that a user has the right to use a particular app. Entitlements are user specific, not device specific. This allows a user with an entitlement to an app to install the app on all their devices. It's also possible for a user to hold an entitlement to an app without installing the app on any device. The API can be used to create an entitlement. As an option, you can also use the API to trigger the installation of an app on all a user's managed devices at the same time the entitlement is created. If the app is free, creating the entitlement also creates a group license for that app. For paid apps, creating the entitlement consumes one license, and that license remains consumed until the entitlement is removed. If the enterprise hasn't purchased enough licenses, then no entitlement is created and the installation fails. An entitlement is also not created for an app if the app requires permissions that the enterprise hasn't accepted. If an entitlement is deleted, the app may be uninstalled from a user's device. As a best practice, uninstall the app by calling Installs.delete() before deleting the entitlement. Entitlements for apps that a user pays for on an unmanaged profile have "userPurchase" as the entitlement reason. These entitlements cannot be removed via the API.

For a free app, a group license is created when an enterprise admin first approves the product in Google Play or when the first entitlement for the product is created for a user via the API. For a paid app, a group license object is only created when an enterprise admin purchases the product in Google Play for the first time. Use the API to query group licenses. A Grouplicenses resource includes the total number of licenses purchased (paid apps only) and the total number of licenses currently in use. In other words, the total number of Entitlements that exist for the product. Only one group license object is created per product and group license objects are never deleted. If a product is unapproved, its group license remains. This allows enterprise admins to keep track of any remaining entitlements for the product.

Note that it is not possible to force the installation of a specific version of an app: the version code is read-only. If a user installs an app themselves (as permitted by the enterprise), then again an install resource and possibly an entitlement resource are automatically created. The API can also be used to delete an install resource, which triggers the removal of the app from the device.
