# Permission

A Permissions resource represents some extra capability, to be granted to an Android app, which requires explicit consent. An enterprise admin must consent to these permissions on behalf of their users before an entitlement for the app can be created. The permissions collection is read-only. The information provided for each permission (localized name and description) is intended to be used in the MDM user interface when obtaining consent from the enterprise.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**description** | **str** | A longer description of the Permissions resource, giving more details of what it affects. | [optional] 
**name** | **str** | The name of the permission. | [optional] 
**permission_id** | **str** | An opaque string uniquely identifying the permission. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.permission import Permission

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Permission from a JSON string
permission_instance = Permission.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(Permission.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
permission_dict = permission_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Permission from a dict
permission_from_dict = Permission.from_dict(permission_dict)
```
