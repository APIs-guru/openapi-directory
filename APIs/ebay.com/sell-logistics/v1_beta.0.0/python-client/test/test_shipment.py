The rates returned are all valid for a specific time window and all quoted prices are at eBay-negotiated rates. <br><br>Select one of the live rates and using its associated <b>rateId</b>, create a \"shipment\" for the package by calling <b>createFromShippingQuote</b>. Creating a shipment completes an agreement, and the cost of the base service and any added shipping options are summed into the returned <b>totalShippingCost</b> value. This action also generates a shipping label that you can use to ship the package.  The total cost of the shipment is incurred when the package is shipped using the supplied shipping label.  <p class=\"tablenote\"><b>Important!</b> Sellers must set up a payment method via their eBay account before they can use the methods in this API to create a shipment and the associated shipping label.</p>
