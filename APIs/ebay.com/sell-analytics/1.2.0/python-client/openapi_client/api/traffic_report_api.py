     Seller Service Metrics API 

    The <i>Analytics API</i> provides data and information about a seller and their eBay business.  <br><br>The resources and methods in this API let sellers review information on their listing performance, metrics on their customer service performance, and details on their eBay seller performance rating.  <br><br>The three resources in the Analytics API provide the following data and information: <ul><li><b>Customer Service Metric</b> &ndash; Returns data on a seller's customer service performance as compared to other seller's in the same peer group.</li> <li><b>Traffic Report</b> &ndash; Returns data that shows how buyers are engaging with a seller's listings.</li> <li><b>Seller Standards Profile</b> &ndash; Returns data pertaining to a seller's performance rating.</li></ul> Sellers can use the data and information returned by the various Analytics API methods to determine where they can make improvements to increase sales and how they might improve their seller status as viewed by eBay buyers.  <br><br>For details on using this API, see <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/static/performance/analyzing-performance.html\" title=\"Selling Integration Guide\">Analyzing seller performance</a>.

Format the date range by enclosing the earliest date and end date for the report in brackets (&quot;[ ]&quot;), as follows: [YYYYMMDD..YYYYMMDD] The maximum range between the start and end dates is 90 days, and the earliest start date you can specify is two years prior to the current date, which is defined as 730 days (365 * 2), not accounting for Leap Year. The last date for which traffic data exists is a value called lastUpdatedDate. eBay returns an error if you specify a date range greater than 90 days, or the start date is after the lastUpdatedDate. If the specified end date is beyond the lastUpdatedDate, eBay returns data up to the lastUpdatedDate.

        This method returns a report that details the user traffic received by a seller's listings. A traffic report gives sellers the ability to review how often their listings appeared on eBay, how many times their listings are viewed, and how many purchases were made. The report also returns the report's start and end dates, and the date the information was last updated. When using this call: Be sure to URL-encode the values you pass in query parameters, as described in URI parameters. See the request samples below for details. You can only specify a single metric in the sort parameter and the specified metric must be listed in the metric parameter of your request. Parameter names are case sensitive, but metric names are not. For example, the following are correct: sort=LISTING_IMPRESSION_TOTAL sort=lisitng_impression_total metric=lisitng_impression_total However, these are incorrect: SORT=LISTING_IMPRESSION_TOTAL SORT=lisitng_impression_total Metric=lisitng_impression_total For more information, see Traffic report details.
