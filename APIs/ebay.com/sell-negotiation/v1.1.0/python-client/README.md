# openapi-client
The <b>Negotiations API</b> gives sellers the ability to proactively send discount offers to buyers who have shown an \"interest\" in their listings.  <br><br>By sending buyers discount offers on listings where they have shown an interest, sellers can increase the velocity of their sales.  <br><br>There are various ways for a buyer to show <i>interest </i> in a listing. For example, if a buyer adds the listing to their <b>Watch</b> list, or if they add the listing to their shopping cart and later abandon the cart, they are deemed to have shown an interest in the listing.  <br><br>In the offers that sellers send, they can discount their listings by either a percentage off the listing price, or they can set a new discounted price that is lower than the original listing price.  <br><br>For details about how seller offers work, see <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/offers-to-buyers.html\" title=\"Selling Integration Guide\">Sending offers to buyers</a>.

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation procedure](#installation--usage) and then run the following:

```python

import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.ebay.com/sell/negotiation/v1
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.ebay.com/sell/negotiation/v1"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

configuration.access_token = os.environ["ACCESS_TOKEN"]


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.OfferApi(api_client)
    x_ebay_c_marketplace_id = 'x_ebay_c_marketplace_id_example' # str | The eBay marketplace on which you want to search for eligible listings. For a complete list of supported marketplaces, see Negotiation API requirements and restrictions.
    limit = 'limit_example' # str | This query parameter specifies the maximum number of items to return from the result set on a page in the paginated response. Minimum: 1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Maximum: 200 Default: 10 (optional)
    offset = 'offset_example' # str | This query parameter specifies the number of results to skip in the result set before returning the first result in the paginated response. Combine offset with the limit query parameter to control the items returned in the response. For example, if you supply an offset of 0 and a limit of 10, the first page of the response contains the first 10 results from the complete list of items retrieved by the call. If offset is 10 and limit is 20, the first page of the response contains items 11-30 from the complete result set. Default: 0 (optional)

    try:
        api_response = api_instance.find_eligible_items(x_ebay_c_marketplace_id, limit=limit, offset=offset)
        print("The response of OfferApi->find_eligible_items:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling OfferApi->find_eligible_items: %s\n" % e)

```
