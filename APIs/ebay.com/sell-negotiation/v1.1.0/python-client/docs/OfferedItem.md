# OfferedItem

A complex type that defines the offer being made to an &quot;interested&quot; buyer.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**discount_percentage** | **str** | This value denotes the percentage that the listing in the offer will be discounted from its original listed price. The seller can specify either the exact price of the discounted items with the price field or they can use this field to specify the percentage that the listing will be discounted, but not both. Minimum: 5 Required if you do not specify a price value. | [optional] 
**listing_id** | **str** | This value is a unique eBay-assigned ID that identifies the listing to which the offer pertains. A listingId value is generated by eBay when you list an item with the Trading API. | [optional] 
**price** | [**Amount**](Amount.md) |  | [optional] 
**quantity** | **int** | This integer value indicates the number of items in the eBay listing for which the offer is being made. The offer being made by the seller is an &amp;quot;all or nothing&amp;quot; offer, meaning the buyer must purchase the indicated quantity of items in order to receive the discount on the transaction. Default: 1 | [optional]
