        with filter criteria for the customer service metrics report. When using
        this method, specify the feedType and filterCriteria including both

        The method returns the location response header containing the call URI
        to use with getCustomerServiceMetricTask to retrieve status and details
        on the task. Only CURRENT Customer Service Metrics reports can be
        generated with the Sell Feed API. PROJECTED reports are not supported at
        this time. See the getCustomerServiceMetric method document in the
        Analytics API for more information about these two types of reports.
        Note: Before calling this API, retrieve the summary of the seller's
        performance and rating for the customer service metric by calling
        getCustomerServiceMetric (part of the Analytics API). You can then
        populate the create task request fields with the values from the
        response. This technique eliminates failed tasks that request a report

            is the maximum number of schedules to return per page, from the
            result set. A result set is the complete set of schedules returned
            by the method. Note: Though this parameter is not required to be
            submitted in the request, the parameter defaults to 10 if omitted.
            Note: If this is the last or only page of the result set, the page
            may contain fewer tasks than the limit value. To determine the
            number of pages in a result set, divide the total value (total
            number of tasks matching input criteria) by this limit value, and
            then round up to the next integer. For example, if the total value
            was 120 (120 total tasks) and the limit value was 50 (show 50 tasks
            per page), the total number of pages in the result set is three, so
            the seller would have to make three separate getSchedules calls to
            view all tasks matching the input criteria."
