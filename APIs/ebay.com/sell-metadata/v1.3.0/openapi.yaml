      description: "This method retrieves a list of leaf categories for a marketplace
        and identifies the categories that require items to have an eBay product
        ID value in order to be listed in those categories. An eBay product ID
        value (known as an &quot;ePID&quot;) is a value that references a
        specific product in the eBay Catalog. Note: This method supports the
        eBay Product Based Shopping Experience (PBSE), which is applicable to
        only the US, UK, AU, and CA (English) marketplaces. Note that you can
        also use GetCategoryFeatures in the Trading API to retrieve the same
        information. For more information about using this method with PBSE, see
        the Product-Based Shopping Experience Playbook. Use the marketplace_id
        path parameter to specify the marketplace you want to review and use the
        filter query parameter to limit the categories returned in the response.
        Tip: This method can return a very large response payload and we
        strongly recommend you get the results from this call in a GZIP file by
        including the following HTTP header with your request:
