# openapi-client
The Catalog API allows users to search for and locate an eBay catalog product that is a direct match for the product that they wish to sell. Listing against an eBay catalog product helps insure that all listings (based off of that catalog product) have complete and accurate information. In addition to helping to create high-quality listings, another benefit to the seller of using catalog information to create listings is that much of the details of the listing will be prefilled, including the listing title, the listing description, the item specifics, and a stock image for the product (if available). Sellers will not have to enter item specifics themselves, and the overall listing process is a lot faster and easier.

```python

import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.ebay.com/commerce/catalog/v1_beta
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.ebay.com/commerce/catalog/v1_beta"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

configuration.access_token = os.environ["ACCESS_TOKEN"]


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.ProductApi(api_client)
    epid = 'epid_example' # str | The ePID of the product being requested. This value can be discovered by issuing the <b>search</b> method and examining the value of the <b>productSummaries.epid</b> field for the desired returned product summary.
    x_ebay_c_marketplace_id = 'x_ebay_c_marketplace_id_example' # str | This method also uses the <code>X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID</code> header to identify the seller's eBay marketplace. It is required for all marketplaces except EBAY_US, which is the default. <b>Note:</b> This method is limited to <code>EBAY_US</code>, <code>EBAY_AU</code>, <code>EBAY_CA</code>, and <code>EBAY_GB</code> values. (optional)

    try:
        api_response = api_instance.get_product(epid, x_ebay_c_marketplace_id=x_ebay_c_marketplace_id)
        print("The response of ProductApi->get_product:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling ProductApi->get_product: %s\n" % e)
