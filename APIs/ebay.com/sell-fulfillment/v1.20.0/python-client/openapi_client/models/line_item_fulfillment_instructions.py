With both options, the seller is commiting to getting the order delivered to the buyer within three business days after purchase. <br><br> With the 'Handling time' option, the seller's stated handling time for a listing must be 'same-day' or '1-day', and at least one of the available shipping service options should have a shipping time that guarantees that the buyer receives the order on time. With this option, eBay will set the 'ship-by date' and expected delivery window for the seller, and the seller should just make sure they physically ship the order by the <strong>shipToDate</strong>.<br><br> With the 'Door-to-door' option, the seller must create regional shipping rate tables (with shipping costs and delivery times based on destination regions), and then apply these regional shipping rates/delivery times to the listing. <br><br> If a 'Door-to-door' order does not arrive on time, the seller must refund the buyer the full shipping cost (if any), and the buyer also has the option of returning the item for a full refund, and the seller will also have to pay the return shipping cost.
