```

### Tests

Execute `pytest` to run the tests.

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation procedure](#installation--usage) and then run the following:

```python

import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.ebay.com/sell/compliance/v1
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.ebay.com/sell/compliance/v1"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

configuration.access_token = os.environ["ACCESS_TOKEN"]


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.ListingViolationApi(api_client)
    x_ebay_c_marketplace_id = 'x_ebay_c_marketplace_id_example' # str | This header is required and is used to specify the eBay marketplace identifier. Supported values for this header can be found in the MarketplaceIdEnum type definition. Note that Version 1.4.0 of the Compliance API is only supported on the US, UK, Australia, Canada {English), and Germany sites.
    compliance_type = 'compliance_type_example' # str | A seller uses this query parameter to retrieve listing violations of a specific compliance type. Only one compliance type value should be passed in here. See ComplianceTypeEnum for more information on the compliance types that can be passed in here. If the listing_id query parameter is used, the compliance_type query parameter {if passed in) will be ignored. This is because all of a listing's policy violations {each compliance type) will be returned if a listing_id is provided. Either the listing_id or a compliance_type query parameter must be used, and if the seller only wants to view listing violations of a specific compliance type, both of these parameters can be used. Note: The listing_id query parameter is not yet available for use, so the seller does not have the ability to retrieve listing violations for one or more specific listings. Until the listing_id query parameter becomes available, the compliance_type query parameter is required with each getListingViolations call. (optional)
    offset = 'offset_example' # str | The integer value input into this field controls the first listing violation in the result set that will be displayed at the top of the response. The offset and limit query parameters are used to control the pagination of the output. For example, if offset is set to 10 and limit is set to 10, the call retrieves listing violations 11 thru 20 from the resulting set of violations. Note: This feature employs a zero-based index, where the first item in the list has an offset of 0. If the listing_id parameter is included in the request, this parameter will be ignored. Default: 0 {zero) (optional)
    listing_id = 'listing_id_example' # str | Note: This query parameter is not yet supported for the Compliance API. Please note that until this query parameter becomes available, the compliance_type query parameter is required with each getListingViolations call. This query parameter is used if the user wants to view all listing violations for one or more eBay listings. The string value passed into this field is the unique identifier of the listing, sometimes referred to as the Item ID. Either the listing_id or a compliance_type query parameter must be used, and if the seller only wants to view listing violations of a specific compliance type, both of these parameters can be used. Up to 50 listing IDs can be specified with this query parameter, and each unique listing ID is separated with a comma. (optional)
    limit = 'limit_example' # str | This query parameter is used if the user wants to set a limit on the number of listing violations that are returned on one page of the result set. This parameter is used in conjunction with the offset parameter to control the pagination of the output. For example, if offset is set to 10 and limit is set to 10, the call retrieves listing violations 11 thru 20 from the collection of listing violations that match the value set in the compliance_type parameter. Note: This feature employs a zero-based index, where the first item in the list has an offset of 0. If the listing_id parameter is included in the request, this parameter will be ignored. Default: 100 Maximum: 200 (optional)
    filter = 'filter_example' # str | This filter allows a user to retrieve only listings that are currently out of compliance, or only listings that are at risk of becoming out of compliance. Although other filters may be added in the future, complianceState is the only supported filter type at this time. The two compliance 'states' are OUT_OF_COMPLIANCE and AT_RISK. Below is an example of how to set up this compliance state filter. Notice that the filter type and filter value are separated with a colon (:) character, and the filter value is wrapped with curly brackets. filter=complianceState:{OUT_OF_COMPLIANCE} (optional)

    try:
        api_response = api_instance.get_listing_violations(x_ebay_c_marketplace_id, compliance_type=compliance_type, offset=offset, listing_id=listing_id, limit=limit, filter=filter)
        print("The response of ListingViolationApi->get_listing_violations:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling ListingViolationApi->get_listing_violations: %s\n" % e)

```
