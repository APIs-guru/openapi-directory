This method searches for eBay items by various query parameters and retrieves summaries of the items. You can search by keyword, category, eBay product ID (ePID), or GTIN, charity ID, or a combination of these. Note: Only FIXED_PRICE (Buy It Now) items are returned by default. However, this method does return items where both FIXED_PRICE and AUCTION are available as a buying option. After a bid has been placed, items become active auction items and are no longer returned by default, but they remain accessible by filtering for the AUCTION buying option. This method also supports the following: Filtering by the value of one or multiple fields, such as listing format, item condition, price range, location, and more. For the fields supported by this method, see the filter parameter. Retrieving the refinements (metadata) of an item , such as item aspects (color, brand), condition, category, etc. using the fieldgroups parameter. Filtering by item aspects and other refinements using the aspect_filter parameter. Filtering for items that are compatible with a specific product, using the compatibility_filter parameter. Creating aspects histograms, which enables shoppers to drill down in each refinement narrowing the search results. For details and examples of these capabilities, see Browse API in the Buying Integration Guide. Pagination and sort controls There are pagination controls (limit and offset fields) and sort query parameters that control/sort the data that is returned. By default, the results are sorted by &quot;Best Match&quot;. For more information about Best Match, see the eBay help page Best Match.

### Example

* OAuth Authentication (Client Credentials):

```python
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.models.search_paged_collection import SearchPagedCollection
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

configuration.access_token = os.environ["ACCESS_TOKEN"]

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.ItemSummaryApi(api_client)
    aspect_filter = 'aspect_filter_example' # str | This field lets you filter by item aspects. The aspect name/value pairs and category, which is required, is used to limit the results to specific aspects of the item. For example, in a clothing category one aspect pair would be Color/Red. For example, the method below uses the category ID for Women's Clothing. This will return only items for a woman's red shirt. /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&amp;category_ids=15724&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:15724,Color:{Red} To get a list of the aspects pairs and the category, which is returned in the dominantCategoryId field, set fieldgroups to ASPECT_REFINEMENTS. /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&amp;fieldgroups=ASPECT_REFINEMENTS Required: The category ID is required twice; once as a URI parameter and as part of the aspect_filter. For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/buy/browse/types/gct:AspectFilter (optional)
    auto_correct = 'auto_correct_example' # str | A query parameter that enables auto correction. Valid Values: KEYWORD (optional)
    category_ids = 'category_ids_example' # str | The category ID is used to limit the results. This field can have one category ID or a comma separated list of IDs. For example: /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?category_ids=29792 Note: Currently, you can pass in only one category ID per request. You can also use any combination of the category_Ids, epid, and q fields. This gives you additional control over the result set. For example, let's say you are looking of a toy phone. If you search for &quot;phone&quot;, the result set will be mobile phones because this is the &quot;Best Match&quot; for this search. But if you also include the toy category ID, the results will be what you wanted. For example: /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=phone&amp;category_ids=220 The list of eBay category IDs is not published and category IDs are not the same across all the eBay marketplaces. You can use the following techniques to find a category by site: Use the Category Changes page. Use the Taxonomy API. For details see Get Categories for Buy APIs. Submit the following method to get the dominantCategoryId for an item. /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q= keyword&amp;fieldgroups=ASPECT_REFINEMENTS Note: If a top-level (L1) category is specified, you must also include the q query parameter. Required: The method must have category_ids, epid, gtin, or q (or any combination of these) (optional)
    charity_ids = 'charity_ids_example' # str | The charity ID is used to limit the results to only items associated with the specified charity. This field can have one charity ID or a comma separated list of IDs. The method will return all the items associated with the specified charities. For example: /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?charity_ids=13-1788491,300108469 The charity ID is the charity's registration ID, also known as the Employer Identification Number (EIN). In GB, it is the Charity Registration Number (CRN), commonly called &quot;Charity Number&quot;. To find the charities eBay supports, you can search for a charity at Charity Search or go to Charity Shop. To find the charity ID of a specific charity, click on a charity and use the EIN number. For example, the charity ID for American Red Cross, is 530196605. You can also use any combination of the category_Ids and q fields with a charity_Ids to filter the result set. This gives you additional control over the result set. Restriction: This is supported only on the US and GB marketplaces. Maximum: 20 IDs Required: One ID (optional)
    compatibility_filter = 'compatibility_filter_example' # str | This field specifies the attributes used to define a specific product. The service searches for items matching the keyword or matching the keyword and a product attribute value in the title of the item. For example, if the keyword is brakes and compatibility-filter=Year:2018;Make:Honda, the items returned are items with brakes, 2018, or Honda in the title. The service uses the product attributes to determine if the item is compatible. The service returns the attributes that are compatible and the CompatibilityMatchEnum value that indicates how well the item matches the attributes. For the best compatibility results, submit all the attributes used to define the product. Best Practice: Submit all the product attributes for the specific product. For more details, see Check compatibility in the Buy Integration Guide. Note: The only products supported are cars, trucks, and motorcycles. For an example, see the Samples section. Note: Testing in Sandbox is only supported using mock data. See Testing search in the Sandbox for details. Required: q (keyword) one fitment supported category ID (such as 33559 Brakes) a least one product attribute name/value pair For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/buy/browse/types/gct:CompatibilityFilter (optional)
    epid = 'epid_example' # str | The ePID is the eBay product identifier of a product from the eBay product catalog. This field limits the results to only items in the specified ePID. The Marketing API getMerchandisedProducts method and the Browse API getItem, getItemByLegacyId, and getItemsByItemGroup calls return the ePID of the product. You can also use the product_summary/search method in the Catalog API to search for the ePID of the product. For example: /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?epid=15032 Maximum: 1 Required: The method must have category_ids, epid, gtin, or q (or any combination of these) (optional)
    fieldgroups = 'fieldgroups_example' # str | This field is a comma separated list of values that lets you control what is returned in the response. The default is MATCHING_ITEMS, which returns the items that match the keyword or category specified. The other values return data that can be used to create histograms or provide additional information. Valid Values: ASPECT_REFINEMENTS - This returns the aspectDistributions container, which has the dominantCategoryId, matchCount, and refinementHref for the various aspects of the items found. For example, if you searched for 'Mustang', some of the aspect would be Model Year, Exterior Color, Vehicle Mileage, etc. Note: ASPECT_REFINEMENTS are category specific. BUYING_OPTION_REFINEMENTS - This returns the buyingOptionDistributions container, which has the matchCount and refinementHref for AUCTION and FIXED_PRICE (Buy It Now) items. Note: Classified items are not supported and only &quot;Buy It Now&quot; (non-auction) items are returned. CATEGORY_REFINEMENTS - This returns the categoryDistributions container, which has the categories that the item is in. CONDITION_REFINEMENTS - This returns the conditionDistributions container, such as NEW, USED, etc. Within these groups are multiple states of the condition. For example, New can be New without tag, New in box, New without box, etc. EXTENDED - This returns the shortDescription field, which provides condition and item aspect information and the itemLocation.city field. MATCHING_ITEMS - This is meant to be used with one or more of the refinement values above. You use this to return the specified refinements and all the matching items. FULL - This returns all the refinement containers and all the matching items. Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to this list. Default: MATCHING_ITEMS (optional)
    filter = 'filter_example' # str | This field supports multiple field filters that can be used to limit/customize the result set. For example: /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&amp;filter=price:[10..50] You can also combine filters. /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&amp;filter=price:[10..50],sellers:{rpseller|bigSal} The following are the supported filters.
