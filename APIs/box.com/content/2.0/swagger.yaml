      description: |-
        To get real-time notification of activity in a Box account, use the long poll feature of the /events API. To do so, first call the /events API with an OPTIONS call to retrieve the long poll URL to use. Next, make a GET request to the provided URL to begin listening for events. If an event occurs within an account you are monitoring, you will receive a response with the value new_change. It’s important to note that this response will not come with any other details, but should serve as a prompt to take further action such as calling the /events endpoint with your last known stream_position. After sending this response, the server will close the connection and you will need to repeat the long poll process to begin listening for events again.
        If no events occur for a period of time after you make the GET request to the long poll URL, you will receive a response with the value reconnect. When you receive this response, you’ll make another OPTIONS call to the /events endpoint and repeat the long poll process.
        If you receive no events in retry_timeout seconds, you should make another GET request to the real time server (i.e. URL in the response). This might be necessary in case you do not receive the reconnect message in the face of network errors.
        If you receive max_retries error when making GET requests to the real time server, you should make another OPTIONS request.

        Used to update individual or multiple fields in the file object, including renaming the file, changing its description, and creating a shared link for the file. To move a file, change the ID of its parent folder. An optional If-Match header can be included to prevent race conditions.

        To lock and unlock files, you execute a PUT operation on the /files/{file id} endpoint and set or clear the lock properties on the file.

        Used to create a shared link for this particular file. Please see here for more information on the permissions available for shared links. In order to get default shared link status, set it to an empty access level, i.e. {"shared_link": {}}. In order to disable a shared link, send this same type of PUT request with the value of shared_link set to null, i.e. {"shared_link": null}

Updates can be either add, replace, remove , test, move, or copy. The template instance can only be updated if the template instance already exists. When editing metadata, only values that adhere to the metadata template schema will be accepted.

        Used to update information about the folder. To move a folder, update the ID of its parent. To enable an email address that can be used to upload files to this folder, update the folder_upload_email attribute. An optional If-Match header can be included to ensure that client only updates the folder if it knows about the latest version.

        Used to create a shared link for this particular folder. Please see here for more information on the permissions available for shared links. In order to get default shared link status, set it to an empty access level, i.e. {"shared_link": {}}. In order to disable a shared link, send this same type of PUT request with the value of shared_link set to null, i.e. {"shared_link": null}

        To add or remove an item from a collection, you do a PUT on that item and change the list of collections it belongs to. Philosophically, this is similar to the way “move” operations work on files and folders: you do a PUT on the item and change its parent. It’s the same idea with collections, except you’re changing which collection(s) the item belongs to instead of the folder it belongs to. Currently the only collection available is the favorites collection, and you’ll need to know it’s ID for the user that is making the API call, since every user has a different favorites collection_id.
        The Add/Remove API handling will check all ids passed in before performing any add/removal operations. If any collection ids are malformed or do not exist in the user’s account, the API call will throw a 400. Only if all of the collection ids are valid will the adds and removals be carried out.

        Shared items are any files or folders that are represented by a shared link. Shared items are different from other API resources in that a shared resource doesn’t necessarily have to be in the account of the user accessing it. The actual shared link itself is used along with a normal access token.
        Used to retrieve the metadata about a shared item when only given a shared link. Because of varying permission for shared links, a password may be required to retrieve the shared item. Once the item has been retrieved, you can make API requests against the actual resource /files/{id} or /folders/{id} as long as the shared link and optional password are in the header.

        Returns all defined webhooks for the requesting application and user, up to the limit. If no limit is supplied then Box uses the default limit of 100.
        If more than limit webhooks are defined then Box returns the webhooks in batches. When the results are batched, Box sends limit webhooks along with a next_marker field in the response object. The value of the next_marker field is a marker string that you can use in later requests to tell Box which batch to send next.
        When you send a request that includes a marker string, Box sends the next batch of webhooks, beginning after the last webhook of the previous batch. When the response contains the last of the defined webhooks, Box omits the next_marker field from its response.
        You can use limit and marker together with the marker string returned in the next_marker field to paginate lists of webhooks.

      Metadata can be used for many purposes. Enterprises may want to have a better way to organize their digital assets for their marketing teams or developers may want to provide advanced content functionality such as facilitating workflows or approvals. Metadata is also visible in the Box Web Application. To learn more, please visit the help documentation.
      Templates
      Metadata that belongs to a file/folder is grouped by templates. Templates allow the metadata service to provide a multitude of services, such as pre-defining sets of key:value pairs or schema enforcement on specific fields. For example, a marketingCollateral template may define where and when specific marketing content should be used. You can also see the representation of the template in the Box web application while navigating to a file preview. Currently, metadata associated with folders does not show in the web application.
      Each file/folder can have multiple distinct template instances associated with it, such as a marketingCollateral and retentionPolicy template instances. Template instances are also grouped by scopes. Currently, the only scopes support are enterprise and global. Enterprise scopes are defined on a per enterprises basis, whereas global scopes are Box application-wide. Attribute order within template instances is not guaranteed.
      Currently, there are four attributes supported by templates: string, enum, float, and  date (RFC 3339).

      Global Properties Template
      In addition to enterprise scoped templates, every file on Box has access to the global properties template. The Properties template is a bucket of free form key:value string pairs, with no additional schema associated with it. Properties are ideal for scenarios where applications want to write metadata to file objects in a flexible way, without pre-defined template structure.
      Properties follow all the conventions of standard templates, except for being located at a different endpoint. All requests made to the properties template must be made to /files/{file_id}/metadata/global/properties.
