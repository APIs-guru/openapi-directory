    NPR One is a smart application that brings the best of NPR and Member Station programming, newscasts,
    podcasts, and stories together to create a new experience for listening. It provides an editor-curated and
    localized mobile listening experience based on the content the listener chooses, likes, shares, and enjoys.
    The API provides all of the content and customization in a simple, structured way that is easy for application
    developers to implement.

      description: |-
        If the parameters passed to this endpoint are correct, it will redirect to `npr.org/oauth2/login` for the user to complete the sign-in.

        Currently acceptable values for `scope` are any combination of the following:
        - `identity.readonly` - for read-only access to the Identity Service
        - `identity.write` - for write access to the Identity Service
        - `listening.readonly` - for read-only access to the Listening Service
        - `listening.write` - for write access to the Listening Service
        - `localactivation` - for all access to the Local Activation Service

        It is generally suggested that you assume that you will need all of the current scopes in order to successfully implement an NPR One application.

        If the parameters passed in are NOT correct and the client passed in a valid `redirect_uri` parameter, the request will be redirected to `{{YOUR_REDIRECT_URI}}?error={{ERROR_TYPE}}&message={{ERROR_DESCRIPTION}}`.
        If the parameters passed are NOT correct and the client did not pass in a valid `redirect_uri` parameter, this endpoint will return the errors encoded as JSON objects (along with the corresponding HTTP status code -- usually 400).
        The latter is intended for development and debugging purposes -- in a real-world situation, errors returned as JSON objects are irretrievable by the client application, and thus passing in a valid `redirect_uri` is critical even for the purpose of capturing errors.

        If the user successfully logs in and authorizes the application, the request will be redirected to `{{YOUR_REDIRECT_URI}}?code={{AUTHORIZATION_CODE}}&state={{CSRF_TOKEN}}`

        If the user DENIES the application, they will be redirected to `{{YOUR_REDIRECT_URI}}?error=denied&message=The%20user%20has%20denied%20the%20login%20and%20access%20request&state={{CSRF_TOKEN}}`.
        This means that if your application flow requires a user to log in in order to proceed, it is up to you to give them the proper messaging explaining that the sign-in must be authorized in order to continue.

        Finally, please do not confuse an authorization code with an access token. Once your app has completed this flow, you will still need to call `POST /authorization/v2/token` in order to swap the code for a valid access token.

        Please be aware that the required parameters are contingent on the `grant_type` that you select.

        For the `authorization_code` grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `code` and `redirect_uri` parameters. `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.

        For the `client_credentials` grant type, you do not need to pass in any additional parameters beyond the basic requirements. `code`, `redirect_uri`, `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.

        For the `device_code` grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `code` parameter. `redirect_uri`, `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.

        For the `password` grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `username` and `password` parameters. If you are logging in via a social service, you should also pass in the `service` parameter. (In this case, the access token you receive from the social service will serve as both your username and password.) The `code` and `redirect_uri` parameters are ignored.
        Third-party developers do not have access to this grant type.

        For the `refresh_token` grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `refresh_token` parameter. The `scope` parameter can optionally be used to request a different set of scopes than were used in the original request, but it **cannot** contain any scopes that were not previously requested. If not specified, then `scope` will be set to whichever scopes were used for the original access token request. If trading in an old non-expiring access token for a refresh-enabled token, set the value of `refresh_token` to the access token value and `token_type_hint` must be set to `access_token`. `code`, `redirect_uri`, `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.

        The `temporary_user` grant type is a custom grant type created by NPR to suit our needs for functionality such as our &quot;try-before-you-buy&quot; experience. If you are a third-party developer, you will not have access to this grant type unless we have explicitly given you permission within our system.
        For this grant type, you do not need to pass in any additional parameters beyond the basic requirements. `code`, `redirect_uri`, `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.

        If you are unsure of which grant type to select, assume that `authorization_code` is the one you want.

        Note that at this time, refresh tokens are an opt-in feature; however, in the future, they will gradually transition to being opt-out, and ultimately required for all clients. Our general guidance at this time is that if this endpoint starts returning refresh tokens for you, you are responsible for implementing the code to handle them appropriately in accordance with the OAuth 2.0 spec. For more information about our gradual rollout of this feature, please contact the NPR One API team.

        `client_credentials` token (i.e. you have generated one that you are storing securely for the lifetime of the entire app
        install), we suggest (but do not require) that you call this endpoint and revoke the access token belonging to the
        logged-in user as part of your logout process. If you do not already have a long-lived `client_credentials` token,
        please don't generate one just for the purposes of calling this endpoint.

        If you are building a prototype application, we also recommend that you use this endpoint to clean up access tokens
        that you generate during the testing of your app and do not intend to reuse.

        Note that revoking an access token will automatically revoke any refresh tokens associated with it, and vice-versa.

        A fully-populated link to the ratings endpoint is returned with each individual recommendation and is located in the AudioItemDocument under the `links['recommendations']` object. The query parameters in this link should not be modified.
        Be sure to copy and send back the entire ratings object (RatingData), as new fields may be added to it in the future.

  /sponsorship/v2/ads:

      description: |-
        **Not** for use by NPR One clients (for whom sponsorship is already integrated into the Listening Service), this endpoint is designed to be used by our other client applications to request sponsorship on behalf of a user. Sponsorship units are returned in the form of DAAST XML. It is worth noting that this endpoint attempts to always return XML, even in the case of exceptions.

        The default behavior of this endpoint is asynchronous; on an initial request, a call to our external sponsorship provider is placed on a queue, which is typically processed within 3 minutes. Once the sponsorship call is received and processed, the returned sponsorship units are placed in a cache on our server for the current user. Subsequent calls to this endpoint will return DAAST sponsorship units from this cache until tracking information is submitted, which removes the ad from the cache and will automatically request additional ads asynchronously if there are fewer than a certain number remaining in the cache.

        For development purposes, it's worth noting that there is currently no way to clear a user's cache without submitting some form of tracking.

  /stationfinder/v3/stations:
    get:
      description: |-
        This endpoint has two main use cases:

        - If no query parameters passed in, it returns a list of stations that are geographically closest to the calling client (based on GeoIP information)
        - If one or more query parameters are passed in, it performs a search of NPR stations that match those search criteria (not taking into account the client's physical location)

        Clients wanting to implement a 'Change Station' UI should use this endpoint to power their search. In most cases, you'll want to build a search interface that uses one of the 3 provided schemas: `lat` and `lon` (using e.g. the HTML5 Geolocation API), `city` and `state`, _or_ the generic `q` query which can accept a station name, call letters, network name, or zip code. Technically speaking, `q` can also take in either a city name or a state name, but using the `city` and `state` parameters together will yield more accurate geographic search results than `q={cityName}`.

        The `lat` and `lon` query parameters should always be passed in together (otherwise the API will return a 400 error), and if included in the query, they will take precedence over any other search criteria; that is, `lat` and `lon` will do a purely geographic search and not take into account `q`, `city` or `state`.

        Similarly, `city` and/or `state` will take precedence over (and ignore) `q`.

        If clients want to be able to offer multiple types of searches (e.g. 'Search for a station name, city or zipcode') using a *single* search input form, `q` should be used. But again, be aware that using `city` and `state` together will yield more accurate search results than `q={cityName}`.
