      batches:
        description: >-
          A batch of [CatalogObject](#type-catalogobject)s to be inserted/updated atomically.

          The objects within a batch will be inserted in an all-or-nothing fashion, i.e., if an error occurs

          attempting to insert or update an object within a batch, the entire batch will be rejected. However, an error

          in one batch will not affect other batches within the same request.


          For each object, its `updated_at` field is ignored and replaced with a current [timestamp](#workingwithdates), and its

          `is_deleted` field must not be set to `true`.


          To modify an existing object, supply its ID. To create a new object, use an ID starting

          with `#`. These IDs may be used to create relationships between an object and attributes of

          other objects that reference it. For example, you can create a [CatalogItem](#type-catalogitem) with

          ID `#ABC` and a [CatalogItemVariation](#type-catalogitemvariation) with its `item_id` attribute set to

          `#ABC` in order to associate the [CatalogItemVariation](#type-catalogitemvariation) with its parent

          [CatalogItem](#type-catalogitem).


          Any `#`-prefixed IDs are valid only within a single atomic batch, and will be replaced by server-generated IDs.


          Each batch may contain up to 1,000 objects. The total number of objects across all batches for a single request

          may not exceed 10,000. If either of these limits is violated, an error will be returned and no objects will

          be inserted or updated.

          A value you specify that uniquely identifies this

          request among all your requests. A common way to create

          a valid idempotency key is to use a Universally unique

          identifier (UUID).


          If you're unsure whether a particular request was successful,

          you can reattempt it with the same idempotency key without

          worrying about creating duplicate objects.

          A unique string that identifies this checkout among others

          you've created. It can be any valid string but must be unique for every

          order sent to Square Checkout for a given location ID.


          The idempotency key is used to avoid processing the same order more than

          once. If you're unsure whether a particular checkout was created

          successfully, you can reattempt it with the same idempotency key and all the

          same other parameters without worrying about creating duplicates.


          We recommend using a random number/string generator native to the language

          you are working in to generate strings for your idempotency keys.


          See [Idempotency keys](#idempotencykeys) for more information.

          The URL to redirect to after checkout is completed with `checkoutId`,

          Square's `orderId`, `transactionId`, and `referenceId` appended as URL

          parameters. For example, if the provided redirect_url is

          `http://www.example.com/order-complete`, a successful transaction redirects

          the customer to:


          `http://www.example.com/order-complete?checkoutId=xxxxxx&orderId=xxxxxx&referenceId=xxxxxx&transactionId=xxxxxx`


          If you do not provide a redirect URL, Square Checkout will display an order

          confirmation page on your behalf; however Square strongly recommends that

          you provide a redirect URL so you can verify the transaction results and

          finalize the order through your existing/normal confirmation workflow.
