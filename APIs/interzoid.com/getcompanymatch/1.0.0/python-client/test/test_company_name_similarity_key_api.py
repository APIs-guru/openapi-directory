    Interzoid Get Company Name Match Similarity Key API

    This API provides a similarity key used to match with other similar company name data, including for purposes of deduplication, fuzzy matching, or merging of datasets. A much higher match rate will be achieved by matching on the algorithmically generated similarity key rather than the data itself.

    The version of the OpenAPI document: 1.0.0
