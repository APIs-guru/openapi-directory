    Interzoid Get Address Match Similarity Key API

    This API provides a similarity key used to match with other similar street address data, including for purposes of deduplication, fuzzy matching, or merging of datasets. A much higher match rate will be achieved by matching on the algorithmically generated similarity key rather than the data itself.
