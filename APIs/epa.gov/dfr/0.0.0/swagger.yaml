  description: |
    Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) is a tool developed and maintained by EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance for public use. ECHO provides integrated compliance and enforcement information for about 800,000 regulated facilities nationwide.
    <BR><BR>DFR Rest Services provide multiple service endpoints, to retrieve detailed facility location, enforcement, compliance monitoring, and pollutant information for any single facility.  See the Detailed Facility Report (DFR) Help Page (https://echo.epa.gov/help/reports/detailed-facility-report-help) for additional information on the DFR.  Additionally, a Data Dictionary (https://echo.epa.gov/help/reports/dfr-data-dictionary) is also available.<BR><BR>
    There is one primary service end point, get_dfr, that provides all available DFR data.  All other service end points that are exposed, will return data on a single section of the DFR. <br>

        This procedure obtains data for the CWA SNC/RNC History section located in the Three Year ompliance Status by Quarter portion of the DFR. Valid Compliance Statuses are as follows.
        > S = SNC/Category I - an enforcement action has been issued, and the facility is not meeting its compliance schedule
        > E = SNC/Category I - effluent violations of monthly average limits (Technical Review Criteria and chronic)
        > X = SNC/Category I - effluent violations of non-monthly average limits (Technical Review Criteria and chronic)
        > T = SNC/Category I - compliance schedule reporting violation
        > D = SNC/Category I - reporting violation - nonreceipt of DMR
        > N = RNC/Category II - reportable non-compliance
        > P = Resolved Pending - an enforcement action has been issued, and facility compliance with the action is pending final completion
        > R = Resolved - the facility has returned to compliance with its permit conditions, either with or without issuance of an enforcement action
        > C = Not considered in RNC/SNC based on manual review of data by state or EPA region. This manual override status is also indicated by a superscripted "m".
        > Blank = Not considered in RNC/SNC
        > N/A = EPA's data system is not able to determine the facility-level compliance status based upon the information available. This information may be available from a state database.

          For CWA, the Permit Compliance System (PCS) designates a permitted facility as being Active or Inactive. Under the CWA, all facilities discharging pollutants from a point source (e.g., a pipe) to surface waters must have a NPDES permit. For CWA, ICISNPDES designates a permit as Effective, Administratively Continued, Expired, Not Needed, Pending, Retired, or Terminated. RCRA facilities (sites) are designated as Active or Inactive.

Under the CAA, federally reportable sources include majors, synthetic minors, NESHAP Part 61 minors, minors with an unresolved High Priority Violation (HPV), with recent enforcement actions, or included on a Compliance Monitoring Strategy plan. The Clean Air Act requires that delegated agencies and EPA track all federally reportable sources in Air Facility System (AFS).
          - For CWA  = Each CWA Source ID or National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit is defined by the program office as a Major or Minor discharger.
          - For RCRA = RCRA Source ID or permits for Treatment, Storage and Disposal facilities are identified by TSD, Large Quantity Generators are identified by LQG. Other values include Permit Workload (PMT), Closure Workload (CLO), Small Quantity Generator Universe (SQG), Conditionally-Exempt Small Quantity Generator (CESQG), Post-Closure Workload (POST CL), and Transporters.
