Geocoding Endpoint

 ### Introduction  ![Geocoding Example](./img/geocoding-example.png)  _Geocoding_ describes the process of transforming an textual address representation to a coordinate (`latitude,longitude`). For example the conversion from `Berlin` to `52.5170365,13.3888599`.  _Reverse geocoding_ converts a coordinate to a textual address representation or place name. Find out more about Geocoding itself on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding). 

### Example

* Api Key Authentication (api_key):

```python
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.models.geocoding_response import GeocodingResponse
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://graphhopper.com/api/1
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://graphhopper.com/api/1"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure API key authorization: api_key
configuration.api_key['api_key'] = os.environ["API_KEY"]

# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['api_key'] = 'Bearer'

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.GeocodingAPIApi(api_client)
    q = 'q_example' # str | If you do forward geocoding, this is `required` and is a textual description of the address you are looking for. (optional)
    locale = 'en' # str | Display the search results for the specified locale. Currently French (fr), English (en), German (de) and Italian (it) are supported. If the locale wasn't found the default (en) is used. (optional) (default to 'en')
    limit = 10 # int | Specify the maximum number of results to return (optional) (default to 10)
    reverse = False # bool | It is `required` to be `true` if you want to do a reverse geocoding request. If it is `true`, `point` must be defined as well, and `q` must not be used. (optional) (default to False)
    debug = False # bool | If `true`, the output will be formatted. (optional) (default to False)
    point = 'point_example' # str | _Forward geocoding_: The location bias in the format 'latitude,longitude' e.g. point=45.93272,11.58803. _Reverse geocoding_: The location to find amenities, cities. (optional)
    provider = 'default' # str | The provider parameter is currently under development and can fall back to `default` at any time. The intend is to provide alternatives to our default geocoder. Each provider has its own strenghts and might fit better for certain scenarios, so it's worth to compare the different providers. To try it append the `provider`parameter to the URL like `&provider=nominatim`, the result structure should be identical in all cases - if not, please report this back to us. Keep in mind that some providers do not support certain parameters or don't return some fields, for example `osm_id` and `osm_type` are not supported by every geocoding provider. If you would like to use additional parameters of one of the providers, but it's not available for the GraphHopper Geocoding API, yet? Please contact us.  The credit costs can be different for all providers - see [here](https://support.graphhopper.com/support/solutions/articles/44000718211-what-is-one-credit-) for more information about it.  Currently, only the default provider and gisgraphy supports autocompletion of partial search strings.  All providers support normal \"forward\" geocoding and reverse geocoding via `reverse=true`.  #### Default (`provider=default`)  This provider returns results of our internal geocoding engine, as described above. In addition to the above documented parameters the following parameters are possible: * `bbox` - the expected format is `minLon,minLat,maxLon,maxLat` * `osm_tag` - you can filter `key:value` or exclude places with certain OpenStreetMap tags `!key:value`. E.g. `osm_tag=tourism:museum` or just the key `osm_tag=tourism`. To exclude multiple tags you add multiple `osm_tag` parameters.  #### Nominatim (`provider=nominatim`)  The GraphHopper Directions API uses a commercially hosted Nominatim geocoder. You can try this provider [here](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/). The provider does **not** fall under the [restrictions](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/) of the Nominatim instance hosted by OpenStreetMap.  In addition to the above documented parameters Nominatim allows to use the following parameters, which can be used as documented [here](https://github.com/openstreetmap/Nominatim/blob/master/docs/api/Search.md#parameters):  * `viewbox` - the expected format is `minLon,minLat,maxLon,maxLat` * `bounded` - If 1 and a viewbox is given, restrict the result to items contained within that viewbox. Default is 0.  #### Gisgraphy (`provider=gisgraphy`)  This provider returns results from the Gisgraphy geocoder which you can try [here](https://services.gisgraphy.com/static/leaflet/index.html).  **Limitations:** The `locale` parameter is not supported. Gisgraphy does not return OSM tags or an extent.  Gisgraphy has a special autocomplete API, which you can use by adding `autocomplete=true` (does not work with `reverse=true`). The autocomplete API is optimized on predicting text input, but returns less information.  In addition to the above documented parameters Gisgraphy allows to use the following parameters, which can be used as documented [here](https://www.gisgraphy.com/documentation/user-guide.php#geocodingservice):  * `radius` - radius in meters * `country` - restrict search for the specified country. The value must be the ISO 3166 Alpha 2 code of the country.  #### NetToolKit (`provider=nettoolkit`)  This provider returns results from the NetToolKit provider which is specialized for US addresses and provides a wrapper around Nominatim for other addresses. You can try it [here](https://www.nettoolkit.com/geo/demo).  The following additional NetToolKit parameters are supported (read [here](https://www.nettoolkit.com/docs/geo/geocoding) for more details): - `source`: User can choose which source provider to geocode the address, this value is \"NetToolKit\" by default - `country_code`: an iso-3166-2 country code (e.g : US) filter the results to the specify country code  **Limitations:** NetToolKit does not support the `locale` parameter. NetToolKit does not return OSM tags (e.g. osm_id, osm_type, osm_value).  #### OpenCage Data (`provider=opencagedata`)  This provider returns results from the OpenCageData geocoder which you can try [here](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/demo).  In addition to the above documented parameters OpenCage Data allows to use the following parameters, which can be used as documented [here](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/api#forward-opt):  * countrycode - The country code is a two letter code as defined by the ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2 standard. E.g. gb for the United Kingdom, fr for France, us for United States.  * bounds - the expected format is `minLon,minLat,maxLon,maxLat`  (optional) (default to 'default')

        pprint(api_response)
