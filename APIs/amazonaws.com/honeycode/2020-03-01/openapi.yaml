For example, the number 1.325 with two decimal places in the format will have it''s raw value as "1.325" and formatted value as "1.33". A currency value for $10 will have the raw value as "10" and formatted value as "$10.00". A value representing 20% with two decimal places in the format will have its raw value as "0.2" and the formatted value as "20.00%". An accounting value of -$25 will have "-25" as the raw value and "$ (25.00)" as the formatted value. </p> <p> Cells with format TEXT will have the raw text as the raw value.
