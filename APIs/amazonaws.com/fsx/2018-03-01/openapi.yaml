You periodically take backups and copy them to another Region so that in the event of a disaster in the primary Region, you can restore from backup and recover availability quickly in the other Region. You can make cross-Region copies only within your AWS partition.</p> <p> You can also use backup copies to clone your file data set to another Region or within the same Region.</p> <p>You can use the <code>SourceRegion</code> parameter to specify the AWS Region from which the backup will be copied. For example, if you make the call from the <code>us-west-1</code> Region and want to copy a backup from the <code>us-east-2</code> Region, you specify <code>us-east-2</code> in the <code>SourceRegion</code> parameter to make a cross-Region copy. If you don''t specify a Region, the backup copy is created in the same Region where the request is sent from (in-Region copy).</p> <p>For more information on creating backup copies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/using-backups.html#copy-backups"> Copying backups</a> in the <i>Amazon FSx for Windows User Guide</i> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/using-backups-fsx.html#copy-backups">Copying backups</a> in the <i>Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide</i>.</p>'

      description: 'Creates an Amazon FSx for Lustre data repository task. You use data repository tasks to perform bulk operations between your Amazon FSx file system and its linked data repository. An example of a data repository task is exporting any data and metadata changes, including POSIX metadata, to files, directories, and symbolic links (symlinks) from your FSx file system to its linked data repository. A <code>CreateDataRepositoryTask</code> operation will fail if a data repository is not linked to the FSx file system.
