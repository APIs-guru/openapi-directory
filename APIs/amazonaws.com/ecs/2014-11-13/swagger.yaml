  title: Amazon EC2 Container Service
  description: '<fullname>Amazon Elastic Container Service</fullname> <p>Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. You can host your cluster on a serverless infrastructure that is managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks using the Fargate launch type. For more control, you can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that you manage by using the EC2 launch type. For more information about launch types, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html">Amazon ECS Launch Types</a>.</p> <p>Amazon ECS lets you launch and stop container-based applications with simple API calls, allows you to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features.</p> <p>You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements. Amazon ECS eliminates the need for you to operate your own cluster management and configuration management systems or worry about scaling your management infrastructure.</p>'

      description: '<p>Runs and maintains a desired number of tasks from a specified task definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below <code>desiredCount</code>, Amazon ECS spawns another copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see <a>UpdateService</a>.</p> <p>In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind a load balancer. The load balancer distributes traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html">Service Load Balancing</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. The deployment is triggered by changing properties, such as the task definition or the desired count of a service, with an <a>UpdateService</a> operation.</p> <p>If a service is using the <code>ECS</code> deployment controller, the <b>minimum healthy percent</b> represents a lower limit on the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the <code>RUNNING</code> state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a minimum healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler may stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state; tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and they are reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%.</p> <p>If a service is using the <code>ECS</code> deployment controller, the <b>maximum percent</b> parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the <code>RUNNING</code> or <code>PENDING</code> state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for maximum percent is 200%.</p> <p>If a service is using the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> deployment controller and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the <b>minimum healthy percent</b> and <b>maximum percent</b> values are only used to define the lower and upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the <code>RUNNING</code> state while the container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values are not used, although they are currently visible when describing your service.</p> <p>Tasks for services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state. Tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for a replica service for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 100%. The default value for a daemon service for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 0%.</p> <p>When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster using the following logic:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service''s task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).</p> </li> <li> <p>By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement strategy) with the <code>placementStrategy</code> parameter):</p> <ul> <li> <p>Sort the valid container instances, giving priority to instances that have the fewest number of running tasks for this service in their respective Availability Zone. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>'

Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>maximumPercent</code> parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during a deployment, which enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if <code>desiredCount</code> is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available).</p> </li> </ul> <p>When <a>UpdateService</a> stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent of <code>docker stop</code> is issued to the containers running in the task. This results in a <code>SIGTERM</code> and a 30-second timeout, after which <code>SIGKILL</code> is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles the <code>SIGTERM</code> gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no <code>SIGKILL</code> is sent.</p> <p>When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster with the following logic:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service''s task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).</p> </li> <li> <p>By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement strategy):</p> <ul> <li> <p>Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>When the service scheduler stops running tasks, it attempts to maintain balance across the Availability Zones in your cluster using the following logic: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Sort the container instances by the largest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have two, container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for termination.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stop the task on a container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the largest number of running tasks for this service.</p> </li> </ul>'

The contents of the <code>host</code> parameter determine whether your bind mount host volume persists on the host container instance and where it is stored. If the <code>host</code> parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon assigns a host path for your data volume. However, the data is not guaranteed to persist after the containers associated with it stop running.</p> <p>Windows containers can mount whole directories on the same drive as <code>$env:ProgramData</code>. Windows containers cannot mount directories on a different drive, and mount point cannot be across drives. For example, you can mount <code>C:\my\path:C:\my\path</code> and <code>D:\:D:\</code>, but not <code>D:\my\path:C:\my\path</code> or <code>D:\:C:\my\path</code>.</p>'
