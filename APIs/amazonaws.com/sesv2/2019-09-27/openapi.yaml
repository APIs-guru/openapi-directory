  description: '<fullname>Amazon SES API v2</fullname> <p>Welcome to the Amazon SES API v2 Reference. This guide provides information about the Amazon SES API v2, including supported operations, data types, parameters, and schemas.</p> <p> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint">Amazon SES</a> is an AWS service that you can use to send email messages to your customers.</p> <p>If you''re new to Amazon SES API v2, you might find it helpful to also review the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/">Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide</a>. The <i>Amazon SES Developer Guide</i> provides information and code samples that demonstrate how to use Amazon SES API v2 features programmatically.</p> <p>The Amazon SES API v2 is available in several AWS Regions and it provides an endpoint for each of these Regions. For a list of all the Regions and endpoints where the API is currently available, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ses_region">AWS Service Endpoints</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>. To learn more about AWS Regions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html">Managing AWS Regions</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> <p>In each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability Zones. These Availability Zones are physically isolated from each other, but are united by private, low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant network connections. These Availability Zones enable us to provide very high levels of availability and redundancy, while also minimizing latency. To learn more about the number of Availability Zones that are available in each Region, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">AWS Global Infrastructure</a>.</p>'
