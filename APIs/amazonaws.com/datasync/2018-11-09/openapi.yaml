The contents of files that are transferred to the destination might be incomplete or inconsistent with the source files. However, if you start a new task execution on the same task and you allow the task execution to complete, file content on the destination is complete and consistent. This applies to other unexpected failures that interrupt a task execution. In all of these cases, AWS DataSync successfully complete the transfer when you start the next task execution.</p>'

A task always transfers data from the source location to the destination location. The configuration specifies options such as task scheduling, bandwidth limits, etc. A task is the complete definition of a data transfer.</p> <p>When you create a task that transfers data between AWS services in different AWS Regions, one of the two locations that you specify must reside in the Region where DataSync is being used. The other location must be specified in a different Region.</p> <p>You can transfer data between commercial AWS Regions except for China, or between AWS GovCloud (US-East and US-West) Regions.</p> <important> <p>When you use DataSync to copy files or objects between AWS Regions, you pay for data transfer between Regions. This is billed as data transfer OUT from your source Region to your destination Region.
