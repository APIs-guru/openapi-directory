  title: AWS Transfer Family
  description: 'Amazon Web Services Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables the transfer of files over the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), File Transfer Protocol over SSL (FTPS), or Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) directly into and out of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Amazon Web Services helps you seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows to Amazon Web Services Transfer Family by integrating with existing authentication systems, and providing DNS routing with Amazon Route 53 so nothing changes for your customers and partners, or their applications. With your data in Amazon S3, you can use it with Amazon Web Services services for processing, analytics, machine learning, and archiving. Getting started with Amazon Web Services Transfer Family is easy since there is no infrastructure to buy and set up.'

      description: 'If the <code>IdentityProviderType</code> of a file transfer protocol-enabled server is <code>AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE</code> or <code>API_Gateway</code>, tests whether your identity provider is set up successfully. We highly recommend that you call this operation to test your authentication method as soon as you create your server. By doing so, you can troubleshoot issues with the identity provider integration to ensure that your users can successfully use the service.'

As a workaround, you can use the Amazon S3 API or EFS API to create 0 byte objects as place holders for your directory. If using the CLI, use the <code>s3api</code> or <code>efsapi</code> call instead of <code>s3</code> or <code>efs</code> so you can use the put-object operation.
