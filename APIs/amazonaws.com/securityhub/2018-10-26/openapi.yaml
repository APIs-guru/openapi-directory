  title: AWS SecurityHub
  description: '<p>Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of the security state of your Amazon Web Services environment and resources. It also provides you with the readiness status of your environment based on controls from supported security standards. Security Hub collects security data from Amazon Web Services accounts, services, and integrated third-party products and helps you analyze security trends in your environment to identify the highest priority security issues. For more information about Security Hub, see the <i>Security Hub<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html">User Guide</a> </i>.</p> <p>When you use operations in the Security Hub API, the requests are executed only in the Amazon Web Services Region that is currently active or in the specific Amazon Web Services Region that you specify in your request. Any configuration or settings change that results from the operation is applied only to that Region. To make the same change in other Regions, execute the same command for each Region to apply the change to.</p> <p>For example, if your Region is set to <code>us-west-2</code>, when you use <code>CreateMembers</code> to add a member account to Security Hub, the association of the member account with the administrator account is created only in the <code>us-west-2</code> Region. Security Hub must be enabled for the member account in the same Region that the invitation was sent from.</p> <p>The following throttling limits apply to using Security Hub API operations.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>BatchEnableStandards</code> - <code>RateLimit</code> of 1 request per second, <code>BurstLimit</code> of 1 request per second.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>GetFindings</code> - <code>RateLimit</code> of 3 requests per second. <code>BurstLimit</code> of 6 requests per second.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>UpdateFindings</code> - <code>RateLimit</code> of 1 request per second. <code>BurstLimit</code> of 5 requests per second.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>UpdateStandardsControl</code> - <code>RateLimit</code> of 1 request per second, <code>BurstLimit</code> of 5 requests per second.</p> </li> <li> <p>All other operations - <code>RateLimit</code> of 10 requests per second. <code>BurstLimit</code> of 30 requests per second.</p> </li> </ul>'

A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters.</p> <p>To search for values that do not contain the filter criteria value, use one of the following comparison operators:</p> <ul> <li> <p>To search for values that do not exactly match the filter value, use <code>NOT_EQUALS</code>.</p> <p>For example, the filter <code>ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy</code> matches findings that have a resource type other than <code>AwsIamPolicy</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>To search for values that do not start with the filter value, use <code>PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS</code>.</p> <p>For example, the filter <code>ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam</code> matches findings that have a resource type that does not start with <code>AwsIam</code>.

A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters.</p> <p>For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an <code>EQUALS</code> filter and a <code>NOT_EQUALS</code> or <code>PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS</code> filter. Combining filters in this way always returns an error, even if the provided filter values would return valid results.</p> <p>You can combine <code>PREFIX</code> filters with <code>NOT_EQUALS</code> or <code>PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS</code> filters for the same field. Security Hub first processes the <code>PREFIX</code> filters, then the <code>NOT_EQUALS</code> or <code>PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS</code> filters.</p> <p> For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either <code>AwsIAM</code> or <code>AwsEc2</code>. It then excludes findings that have a resource type of <code>AwsIamPolicy</code> and findings that have a resource type of <code>AwsEc2NetworkInterface</code>.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface</code> </p> </li> </ul>'
