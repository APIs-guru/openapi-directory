  title: AWS Key Management Service
  description: '<fullname>AWS Key Management Service</fullname> <p>AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide describes the AWS KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about AWS KMS, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/"> <i>AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide</i> </a>.</p> <note> <p>AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS KMS and other AWS services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p> </note> <p>We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to AWS KMS.</p> <p>Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.</p> <p> <b>Signing Requests</b> </p> <p>Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you <i>do not</i> use your AWS account (root) access key ID and secret key for everyday work with AWS KMS. Instead, use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user, or you can use the AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials that you can use to sign requests.</p> <p>All AWS KMS operations require <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4</a>.</p> <p> <b>Logging API Requests</b> </p> <p>AWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS API calls and related events for your AWS account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to AWS KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/">AWS CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>Additional Resources</b> </p> <p>For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html">AWS Security Credentials</a> - This topic provides general information about the of credentials used for accessing AWS.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html">Temporary Security Credentials</a> - This section of the <i>IAM User Guide</i> describes how to create and use temporary security credentials.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4 Signing Process</a> - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing a request using an access key ID and a secret access key.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Commonly Used APIs</b> </p> <p>Of the APIs discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful for most applications. You will likely perform actions other than these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the console.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>Encrypt</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>Decrypt</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GenerateDataKey</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext</a> </p> </li> </ul>'

You can disconnect and reconnect a custom key store at any time.</p> <p>To connect a custom key store, its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster must have at least one active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a cluster, use the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeClusters">DescribeClusters</a> operation.

However, this response does not indicate that the custom key store is connected. To get the connection state of the custom key store, use the <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> operation.</p> <p>During the connection process, AWS KMS finds the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store, creates the connection infrastructure, connects to the cluster, logs into the AWS CloudHSM client as the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-concepts.html#concept-kmsuser"> <code>kmsuser</code> crypto user</a> (CU), and rotates its password.</p> <p>The <code>ConnectCustomKeyStore</code> operation might fail for various reasons. To find the reason, use the <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> operation and see the <code>ConnectionErrorCode</code> in the response. For help interpreting the <code>ConnectionErrorCode</code>, see <a>CustomKeyStoresListEntry</a>.</p> <p>To fix the failure, use the <a>DisconnectCustomKeyStore</a> operation to disconnect the custom key store, correct the error, use the <a>UpdateCustomKeyStore</a> operation if necessary, and then use <code>ConnectCustomKeyStore</code> again.</p> <p>If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting a custom key store, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html">Troubleshooting a Custom Key Store</a> in the <i>AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>'

When it creates a new container, it uses this operation (<code>GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext</code>) to get an encrypted data key and then stores it in the container. Later, a different component of the system, called the <i>data plane</i>, puts encrypted data into the containers. To do this, it passes the encrypted data key to the <a>Decrypt</a> operation, then uses the returned plaintext data key to encrypt data, and finally stores the encrypted data in the container. In this system, the control plane never sees the plaintext data key.</p> <p>The result of this operation varies with the key state of the CMK.

      description: '<p>Schedules the deletion of a customer master key (CMK). You may provide a waiting period, specified in days, before deletion occurs. If you do not provide a waiting period, the default period of 30 days is used. When this operation is successful, the key state of the CMK changes to <code>PendingDeletion</code>. Before the waiting period ends, you can use <a>CancelKeyDeletion</a> to cancel the deletion of the CMK. After the waiting period ends, AWS KMS deletes the CMK and all AWS KMS data associated with it, including all aliases that refer to it.</p> <important> <p>Deleting a CMK is a destructive and potentially dangerous operation. When a CMK is deleted, all data that was encrypted under the CMK is unrecoverable.
