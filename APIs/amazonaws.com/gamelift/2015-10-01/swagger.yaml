A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit. </p> <p>When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status <code>REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE</code>. This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error.</p> <p>To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players. Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status <code>PLACING</code>, where a new game session is created for the match. </p> <p>If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets where all players accepted the match, the ticket status is returned to <code>SEARCHING</code> to find a new match. For tickets where one or more players failed to accept the match, the ticket status is set to <code>FAILED</code>, and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted as needed. </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>StartMatchmaking</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeMatchmaking</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>StopMatchmaking</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>AcceptMatch</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>StartMatchBackfill</a> </p> </li> </ul>'

By using a fleet alias instead of a specific fleet ID, you can switch gameplay and players to a new fleet without changing your game client or other game components. For example, for games in production, using an alias allows you to seamlessly redirect your player base to a new game server update. </p> <p>Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site. </p> <p>To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID, which you can reference when creating a game session. You can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling <code>UpdateAlias</code>.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateAlias</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListAliases</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeAlias</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateAlias</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteAlias</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ResolveAlias</a> </p> </li> </ul>'

This helper command uploads your build and creates a new build record in one step, and automatically handles the necessary permissions. </p> </important> <p>The <code>CreateBuild</code> operation should be used only when you need to manually upload your build files, as in the following scenarios:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Store a build file in an Amazon S3 bucket under your own AWS account. To use this option, you must first give Amazon GameLift access to that Amazon S3 bucket. To create a new build record using files in your Amazon S3 bucket, call <code>CreateBuild</code> and specify a build name, operating system, and the storage location of your game build.</p> </li> <li> <p>Upload a build file directly to Amazon GameLift''s Amazon S3 account. To use this option, you first call <code>CreateBuild</code> with a build name and operating system. This action creates a new build record and returns an Amazon S3 storage location (bucket and key only) and temporary access credentials. Use the credentials to manually upload your build file to the storage location (see the Amazon S3 topic <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UploadingObjects.html">Uploading Objects</a>). You can upload files to a location only once. </p> </li> </ul> <p>If successful, this operation creates a new build record with a unique build ID and places it in <code>INITIALIZED</code> status. You can use <a>DescribeBuild</a> to check the status of your build. A build must be in <code>READY</code> status before it can be used to create fleets.</p> <p> <b>Learn more</b> </p> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-build-intro.html">Uploading Your Game</a> </p> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-build-cli-uploading.html#gamelift-build-cli-uploading-create-build"> Create a Build with Files in Amazon S3</a> </p> <p> <b>Related operations</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateBuild</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListBuilds</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeBuild</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateBuild</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteBuild</a> </p> </li> </ul>'

To add placement requests to a queue, call <a>StartGameSessionPlacement</a> and reference the queue name.</p> <p> <b>Destination order.</b> When processing a request for a game session, Amazon GameLift tries each destination in order until it finds one with available resources to host the new game session. A queue''s default order is determined by how destinations are listed. The default order is overridden when a game session placement request provides player latency information. Player latency information enables Amazon GameLift to prioritize destinations where players report the lowest average latency, as a result placing the new game session where the majority of players will have the best possible gameplay experience.</p> <p> <b>Player latency policies.</b> For placement requests containing player latency information, use player latency policies to protect individual players from very high latencies. With a latency cap, even when a destination can deliver a low latency for most players, the game is not placed where any individual player is reporting latency higher than a policy''s maximum. A queue can have multiple latency policies, which are enforced consecutively starting with the policy with the lowest latency cap. Use multiple policies to gradually relax latency controls; for example, you might set a policy with a low latency cap for the first 60 seconds, a second policy with a higher cap for the next 60 seconds, etc. </p> <p>To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, a list of destinations and, if desired, a set of latency policies.

      operationId: PutScalingPolicy
      description: '<p>Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet''s hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet''s capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling. </p> <p>Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences.</p> <p>You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling <a>StopFleetActions</a> with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call <a>StartFleetActions</a> with the same fleet action. To stop just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove it, you must delete the policy with <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a>.</p> <p>Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html">Set Up Fleet Automatic Scaling</a>.</p> <p> <b>Target-based policy</b> </p> <p>A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet''s hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet''s buffer; it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target. </p> <p>For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet''s available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer. </p> <p>To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a <a>TargetConfiguration</a> object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it''s successfully created. If the fleet''s auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.</p> <p> <b>Rule-based policy</b> </p> <p>A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action. </p> <p>For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%."</p> <p>A policy''s rule statement has the following structure:</p> <p>If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code> <code>[Threshold]</code> for <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes, then <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code> to/by <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>.</p> <p>To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:</p> <p>If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code> <code>[20]</code> for <code>[15]</code> minutes, then <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code> to/by <code>[10]</code>.</p> <p>To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they''re successfully created. If the fleet''s auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DescribeFleetCapacity</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeEC2InstanceLimits</a> </p> </li> <li> <p>Manage scaling policies:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>PutScalingPolicy</a> (auto-scaling)</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeScalingPolicies</a> (auto-scaling)</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a> (auto-scaling)</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Manage fleet actions:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>StartFleetActions</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>StopFleetActions</a> </p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>'

You can search or sort by the following game session attributes:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>gameSessionId</b> -- Unique identifier for the game session. You can use either a <code>GameSessionId</code> or <code>GameSessionArn</code> value. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>gameSessionName</b> -- Name assigned to a game session. This value is set when requesting a new game session with <a>CreateGameSession</a> or updating with <a>UpdateGameSession</a>. Game session names do not need to be unique to a game session.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>gameSessionProperties</b> -- Custom data defined in a game session''s <code>GameProperty</code> parameter. <code>GameProperty</code> values are stored as key:value pairs; the filter expression must indicate the key and a string to search the data values for. For example, to search for game sessions with custom data containing the key:value pair "gameMode:brawl", specify the following: <code>gameSessionProperties.gameMode = "brawl"</code>. All custom data values are searched as strings.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>maximumSessions</b> -- Maximum number of player sessions allowed for a game session. This value is set when requesting a new game session with <a>CreateGameSession</a> or updating with <a>UpdateGameSession</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>creationTimeMillis</b> -- Value indicating when a game session was created. It is expressed in Unix time as milliseconds.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>playerSessionCount</b> -- Number of players currently connected to a game session. This value changes rapidly as players join the session or drop out.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>hasAvailablePlayerSessions</b> -- Boolean value indicating whether a game session has reached its maximum number of players. It is highly recommended that all search requests include this filter attribute to optimize search performance and return only sessions that players can join. </p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>Returned values for <code>playerSessionCount</code> and <code>hasAvailablePlayerSessions</code> change quickly as players join sessions and others drop out.

      description: '<p>Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking rules, and starts a new game for the matched players. Each matchmaking request specifies the type of match to build (team configuration, rules for an acceptable match, etc.). The request also specifies the players to find a match for and where to host the new game session for optimal performance. A matchmaking request might start with a single player or a group of players who want to play together. FlexMatch finds additional players as needed to fill the match. Match type, rules, and the queue used to place a new game session are defined in a <code>MatchmakingConfiguration</code>. For complete information on setting up and using FlexMatch, see the topic <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-intro.html"> Adding FlexMatch to Your Game</a>.</p> <p>To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration, and include the players to be matched.

Notifications are easy to set up (see <a>CreateMatchmakingConfiguration</a>) and typically deliver match status changes faster and more efficiently than polling. We recommend that you use polling to back up to notifications (since delivery is not guaranteed) and call <code>DescribeMatchmaking</code> only when notifications are not received within 30 seconds.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Processing a matchmaking request</b> -- FlexMatch handles a matchmaking request as follows: </p> <ol> <li> <p>Your client code submits a <code>StartMatchmaking</code> request for one or more players and tracks the status of the request ticket. </p> </li> <li> <p>FlexMatch uses this ticket and others in process to build an acceptable match.

If any player rejects or fails to accept the match before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped (see <code>AcceptMatch</code> for more details).</p> </li> <li> <p>Once a match is proposed and accepted, the matchmaking tickets move into status <code>PLACING</code>. FlexMatch locates resources for a new game session using the game session queue (set in the matchmaking configuration) and creates the game session based on the match data. </p> </li> <li> <p>When the match is successfully placed, the matchmaking tickets move into <code>COMPLETED</code> status.
