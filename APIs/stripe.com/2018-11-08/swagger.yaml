        <p>When you create a new refund, you must specify a charge on which to create it.</p>

        <p>Creating a new refund will refund a charge that has previously been created but not yet refunded.
        Funds will be refunded to the credit or debit card that was originally charged.</p>

        <p>You can optionally refund only part of a charge.
        You can do so multiple times, until the entire charge has been refunded.</p>

        <p>Once entirely refunded, a charge can’t be refunded again.
        This method will raise an error when called on an already-refunded charge,
        or when trying to refund more money than is left on a charge.</p>

        <p>Updates the specified customer by setting the values of the parameters passed. Any parameters not provided will be left unchanged. For example, if you pass the <strong>source</strong> parameter, that becomes the customer’s active source (e.g., a card) to be used for all charges in the future. When you update a customer to a new valid source: for each of the customer’s current subscriptions, if the subscription bills automatically and is in the <code>past_due</code> state, then the latest unpaid, unclosed invoice for the subscription will be retried (note that this retry will not count as an automatic retry, and will not affect the next regularly scheduled payment for the invoice). (Note also that no invoices pertaining to subscriptions in the <code>unpaid</code> state, or invoices pertaining to canceled subscriptions, will be retried as a result of updating the customer’s source.)</p>

        <p>At any time, you can preview the upcoming invoice for a customer. This will show you all the charges that are pending, including subscription renewal charges, invoice item charges, etc. It will also show you any discount that is applicable to the customer.</p>

        <p>Note that when you are viewing an upcoming invoice, you are simply viewing a preview – the invoice has not yet been created. As such, the upcoming invoice will not show up in invoice listing calls, and you cannot use the API to pay or edit the invoice. If you want to change the amount that your customer will be billed, you can add, remove, or update pending invoice items, or update the customer’s discount.</p>

        <p>You can preview the effects of updating a subscription, including a preview of what proration will take place. To ensure that the actual proration is calculated exactly the same as the previewed proration, you should pass a <code>proration_date</code> parameter when doing the actual subscription update. The value passed in should be the same as the <code>subscription_proration_date</code> returned on the upcoming invoice resource. The recommended way to get only the prorations being previewed is to consider only proration line items where <code>period[start]</code> is equal to the <code>subscription_proration_date</code> on the upcoming invoice resource.</p>

This effectively forgives the difference between the amount available on the source and the amount due. 

                  Passing `forgive=false` will fail the charge if the source hasn't been pre-funded with the right amount. An example for this case is with ACH Credit Transfers and wires: if the amount wired is less than the amount due by a small amount, you might want to forgive the difference.

With usage information and the pricing model set up by the <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/metered-billing">metered billing</a> plan, Stripe helps you send accurate invoices to your customers.</p>

        <p>The default calculation for usage is to add up all the <code>quantity</code> values of the usage records within a billing period. You can change this default behavior with the billing plan’s <code>aggregate_usage</code> <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api/plans/create#create_plan-aggregate_usage">parameter</a>. When there is more than one usage record with the same timestamp, Stripe adds the <code>quantity</code> values together. In most cases, this is the desired resolution, however, you can change this behavior with the <code>action</code> parameter.</p>

        <p>The default pricing model for metered billing is <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api/plans/object#plan_object-billing_scheme">per-unit pricing</a>. For finer granularity, you can configure metered billing to have a <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/tiers">tiered pricing</a> model.</p>
