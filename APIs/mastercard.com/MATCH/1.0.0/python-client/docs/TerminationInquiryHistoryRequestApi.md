```python

from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.mastercard.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.mastercard.com"
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.TerminationInquiryHistoryRequestApi(api_client)
    page_offset = 0 # float | The zero-based offset to start at. The actual start position is this value +1. An offset of 10 starts at item 11. Combined with the PageLength option this allows pagination to be supported through the service requests.

    irn = '19962016070500348' # str | Inquiry Reference Number (IRN) A unique identifier generated by the MATCH system that is returned in the original, previously submitted POST request (contained within the \"TerminationInquiry.Ref\" response node). This unique identifier should be present as a URL parameter within all GET requests.

    try:
        # Returns information about Merchants, URLs and up to five principal owners, that have been terminated by an acquiring bank from a previous inquiry. The Inquiry History Results resource displays the inquiry with the option to view either; Possible Merchant Matches or Possible Inquiry Matches.
