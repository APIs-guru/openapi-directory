## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**keyboard** | **List[List[KeyboardButton]]** | Array of button rows, each represented by an Array of [KeyboardButton](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#keyboardbutton) objects | 
**one_time_keyboard** | **bool** | *Optional*. Requests clients to hide the keyboard as soon as it&#39;s been used. The keyboard will still be available, but clients will automatically display the usual letter-keyboard in the chat â€“ the user can press a special button in the input field to see the custom keyboard again. Defaults to *false*. | [optional] [default to False]
**resize_keyboard** | **bool** | *Optional*. Requests clients to resize the keyboard vertically for optimal fit (e.g., make the keyboard smaller if there are just two rows of buttons). Defaults to *false*, in which case the custom keyboard is always of the same height as the app&#39;s standard keyboard. | [optional] [default to False]
**selective** | **bool** | *Optional*. Use this parameter if you want to show the keyboard to specific users only. Targets: 1) users that are @mentioned in the *text* of the [Message](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#message) object; 2) if the bot&#39;s message is a reply (has *reply\\_to\\_message\\_id*), sender of the original message.    *Example:* A user requests to change the bot&#39;s language, bot replies to the request with a keyboard to select the new language. Other users in the group don&#39;t see the keyboard. | [optional]
