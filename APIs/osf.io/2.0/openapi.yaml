      Welcome to the Open Science Framework API. With this API you can
      access users, projects, components, logs, and files from the [Open Science
      Framework](https://osf.io/). The Open Science Framework (OSF) is a free,
      open-source service maintained by the [Center for Open
      Science](http://cos.io/).


      The OSF serves as a repository and archive for study designs, materials, data, manuscripts, or anything else associated with your research during the research process. Every project and file on the OSF has a permanent unique identifier, and every registration (a permanent, time-stamped version of your projects and files) can be assigned a DOI. You can use the OSF to measure your impact by monitoring the traffic to projects and files you make public. With the OSF you have full control of what parts of your research are public and what remains private.

      The OSF API generally conforms to the [JSON-API v1.0
      spec](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/). Where exceptions exist, they will
      be noted. Each endpoint will have its own documentation, but there are
      some general principles.


      Note: Assume undocumented routes/features/fields are unstable.


      #### Canonical URLs


      All canonical URLs have trailing slashes.  A request to an endpoint without a trailing slash will result in a **301 Redirect** to the canonical URL.  There are some exceptions when working with the Files API, so if a URL in a response does not have a slash, do not append one.


      #### Plurals


      Endpoints are always pluralized.  `/users/`, not `/user/`, `/nodes/`, not `/node/`.


      The only exception are the node and preprint citation endpoints, which are `/citation/`, not `/citations/`.


      #### Common Actions


      Every endpoint in the OSF API responds to `GET`, `HEAD`, and `OPTION` requests.


      You must have adequate permissions to interact with any endpoint. Unauthorized use will result in **401 Unauthorized** or **403 Forbidden** responses.


      Use `HEAD` to probe an endpoint and make sure your headers are well-formed.


      A `GET` request will return a representation of the entity or entity collection referenced by the endpoint.


      An `OPTIONS` request will return a JSON object that describes the endpoint, including the name, a description, the acceptable request formats, the allowed response formats, and any actions available via the endpoint.


      #### Testing


      ##### Testing Server


      The test-* subdomains of the osf are intended to match, at any given time, the current production environment of the Open Science Framework.


      We have staging servers that will have newer features, including newer API features, that aren't ready for production. However, because those servers are subject to the whims of QA and whichever group needs to do specific testing, they aren't particular stable for API developers.


      The test servers linked below are primarily for developing your API application on a stable system.


      https://test.osf.io/


      https://api.test.osf.io/v2/


      ##### Ephemerality Notice


      Expect the server to be down from time to time while we update software, and don't expect that anything you create on here to exist long-term.


      While this is more stable than a staging server, we won't necessarily run data migrations if anything major happens to our database schema, so we may clear out the data on the test servers periodically.

      #### Token Auth


      To use a Personal Access Token (PAT), make an `Authorization` header with the contents `Bearer <token>` as shown in the example below, replacing `<token>` with your token.


          curl -X "GET" "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/me/" \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"


      To make a Personal Access Token, visit your OSF settings page (either on the [OSF](https://osf.io/settings/tokens/) or our [testing server](https://test.osf.io/settings/tokens/)) to create one. You can limit the scope of the token, but remember that it has access to all of the information that you do within the limits of the scope, so be careful with your tokens.


      #### OAuth


      The OSF allows third-party web applications to connect to the OSF on behalf of other users via the OAuth 2.0 web application flow.


      You can add a developer application from the OSF settings page (either on the [OSF](https://osf.io/settings/tokens/) or our [testing server](https://test.osf.io/settings/tokens/)).


      We will be adding narrative documentation for handling OAuth flows, but for now, if you're familiar with OAuth, you can check out the [CAS overlay documentation](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/cas-overlay#web-server-authorization) for options.


      #### When to use Token Auth

      You should use Token Auth if:

      + You want to use the API to interact with your own OSF data

      + You have scripts to push or extract data from your OSF account

      + You want to use the API to programmatically automate certain actions in your own OSF account


      #### When to use OAuth

      You should use OAuth if:

      + You are requesting access to other people's OSF accounts/data to push or extract data on their behalf

      + You currently ask people for their PAT to request resources on their behalf

      All entity collection endpoints respond to the `page` query
      parameter as described in the [JSON-API
      spec](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-pagination).


      However, links to the first, last, previous, and next pages of results are provided in the `links` key of the response, and you are encouraged to use those rather than adding query parameters by hand.


      If there are only enough results to fill one page, the `first`, `last`, `prev`, and `next` links will be null.


      #### Versioning


      As of version `2.3`, pagination links conform to the JSON API specification. Meta information was pulled out of the `links` object and placed in a top-level `meta` object.


      The `meta` key contains the total number of entities available, as well as the current number of results displayed per page.
    name: Pagination

  - description: >-
      For any additions to the api (new fields, routes, methods, or
      relationships), those additions will be added simultaneously to all
      versions. For any breaking changes and deletions, a new API version will
      be released. Requesting the base API takes the most compatible version of
      the API, not the one with the latest changes. Note that, in the case of
      the OSF model changing, legacy API functionality *may* break. We try very
      hard not to let this happen, but sometimes it's unavoidable.


      Versioning can be specified in three different ways:


      #### URL Path Versioning


      + `/v2/` or `/v3/`


      + A version specified via the URL path is a **required** part of the URL.


      + Only a major version can be specified via the URL path, i.e. `/v2.0.6/` is invalid, additionally, paths such as `/v2.0/` are invalid.


      + If the default version of the API is within the major version specified in the URL path, the default version will be applied (i.e. if the default version is `2.3` and the URL path is `/v2/`, then version returned will be `2.3`).


      + If the default version of the API is not within the major version specified in the URL path, the URL path version will be applied (i.e. if the default version is `3.0` and the URL path is `/v2/`, then the version returned will be `2.0`)


      #### Query Parameter Versioning


      + `/v2/nodes/?version=2.1.6`


      + Pinning to a specific version via a query parameter is **optional**.


      + A specific version (major, minor, or patch) for a single request can be specified via the `version` query parameter, as long as it is an allowed version.


      + If the version specified in the query parameter does not fall within the same major version specified in the URL path, i.e `/v2/nodes/?version=3.1.4` a 409 Conflict response will be returned.


      #### Header Versioning


      + `Accept=application/vnd.api+json;version=3.0.1`


      + Pinning to a specific version via request header is **optional**.


      + A specific version (major, minor, or patch) for a single request can be specified via the `Accept Header` of the request, as long as it is an allowed version.


      + If the version specified in the header does not fall within the same major version specified in the URL path a 409 Conflict response will be returned.


      + If both a header version and query parameter version are specified, the versions must match exactly or a 409 Conflict response will be returned (i.e. one does not take precedence over the other).

      Entity collections can be filtered by adding a query parameter in
      the form:


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`filter[<fieldname>]=<matching information>`


      String queries are filtered using substring matching. For example, if you were trying to find [Lise Meitner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lise_Meitner):


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/users/?filter[full_name]=meitn`


      You can filter on multiple fields, or the same field in different ways, by &-ing the query parameters together.


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/users/?filter[full_name]=lise&filter[family_name]=mei`


      Boolean fields should be queried with `true` or `false`.


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/nodes/?filter[registered]=true`


      You can request multiple resources by filtering on id and placing comma-separated values in your query parameter.


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/nodes/?filter[id]=aegu6,me23a`


      You can filter with case-sensitivity or case-insensitivity by using `contains` and `icontains`, respectively.


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/nodes/?filter[tags][icontains]=help`


      You can also filter on comparable, ordered fields, including datetimes and integers.


      You can filter using comparisons by using the follow syntax:


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`?filter[date_modified][gte]=2014-10-10`


      Valid comparison operators include:

      + `[gte]` = greater than or equal

      + `[gt]` = greater than

      + `[lte]` = less than or equal

      + `[lt]` = less than

      + `[eq]` = equals

      + `[ne]` = does not equal


      These comparison filters work for dates and integers. For example, you can use two comparison filters to specify


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`[date_modified][gte]=2014-10-10&[date_modified][lt]=2014-11-10`


      or exclude


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`[date_created][lt]=2014-10-10&[date_created][gt]=2014-11-10`


      a range of dates from your search. Note that the dates must be in YYYY-MM-DD format.

      All endpoints respond to the `fields` query parameter as described
      in the [JSON-API
      spec](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets).



      From the specification:



      <blockquote>
        <p>A client MAY request that an endpoint return only specific fields in the response on a per-type basis by including a fields[TYPE] parameter.</p>
        <p>The value of the fields parameter MUST be a comma-separated (U+002C COMMA, “,”) list that refers to the name(s) of the fields to be returned.</p>
        <p>If a client requests a restricted set of fields for a given resource type, an endpoint MUST NOT include additional fields in resource objects of that type in its response.</p>
      </blockquote>



      #### Basic Usage



      When making a request to an endpoint that returns a serialized object of some `type`, you can specify `fields[<type>]=<comma,separated,list,of,fields>` to receive a subset of the object's fields in the response.



      For example, the request below will serialize only the `title` attribute and `children` relationship for each node in the response.



      https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/?fields[nodes]=title,children



      Sparse fieldsets can be used to restrict both attribute and relationship fields.

      Note that top-level objects (such as `type`, `id`, `attributes`, `relationships`, and `links`) will always be serialized and cannot be excluded.



      #### Advanced Usage



      Sparse fieldsets can be used to restrict any entity returned in the response.



      For example, the request below will serialize only the `full_name` attribute for each user (auto-embedded by the `embed=contributors` query parameter), and the `title` attribute for each node.



      https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/?fields[nodes]=title,contributors&embed=contributors&fields[users]=full_name



      Any field specified in another query parameters used by the serializer (e.g. `embed`) must also be included in the sparse fieldset.

      For example, fields that are being embedded on the sparse type (e.g. `nodes`) must also be included in `fields[<type>]` when using embeds, or the embed will be invalid.



      A request to embed contributors and restrict nodes to only return the `title` attribute should have the form:



      https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/?embed=contributors&fields[nodes]=title,contributors



      **NOT**



      https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/?embed=contributors&fields[nodes]=title
    name: Sparse Fieldsets
    x-traitTag: true
  - description: >-
      All related resources that appear in the `relationships` attribute
      are embeddable, meaning it is possible to fetch a node and its
      contributors in a single request by adding a query parameter like:


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/nodes/?embed=contributors`


      The embedded results will have the following structure:


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`{relationship_name}: {full_embedded_response}`


      Where `full_embedded_response` means the full API response resulting from a **GET** request to the `href` link of the corresponding related resource.


      This means if there are no errors in processing the embedded request the response will have the format:


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`data: {response}`


      And if there are errors processing the embedded request the response will have the format:


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`errors: {errors}`


      Multiple embeds can be achieved with multiple query parameters separated by "&".


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/nodes/?embed=contributors&embed=comments`


      Some endpoints are automatically embedded, such as the [node contributors](#operation/nodes_contributors_list) endpoint, which automatically embeds user information.
    name: Embedding
    x-traitTag: true
  - description: >-
      All related resources that appear in the `relationships` attribute
      can have a count associated with them, this allows you to see number of
      resources associated with a queried object before you query them. The
      count will appear in the `count` variable of the field’s
      `links.related.meta` object.


      To view the count of objects in the relationship field add the query parameter `?related_counts=<field_name>`, for multiple fields use a comma separated list like `?related_counts=<field_name1>,<field_name2>` for all related fields use `?related_counts=True`.



      For example using the the url `/v2/users/<user_id>/?related_counts=nodes` for a user with 4 nodes will return the following for the node field of the user object.

          GET /v2/users/<user_id>/?related_counts=nodes/
          "nodes": {
            "links": {
              "related": {
                "href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/<user_id>/nodes/",
                "meta": {
                  "count": 4
                }
              }
            }
          },

    x-traitTag: true

      ## Attribute Validation


      Endpoints that allow creation or modification of entities generally limit updates to certain attributes of the entity.


      If you attempt to set an attribute that does not permit updates (such as a `date_created` timestamp), the API will silently ignore that attribute.


      This will not affect the response from the API: if the request would have succeeded without the updated attribute, it will still report as successful. Likewise, if the request would have failed without the attribute update, the API will still report a failure.


      Typoed or non-existent attributes will behave the same as non-updatable attributes and will be silently ignored. If a request is not working the way you expect, make sure to double check your spelling.


      ## Create/Update Requests


      #### Formatting POST/PUT/PATCH Request Bodies


      The OSF API follows the JSON-API spec for [create and update requests](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#crud). This means all request bodies must be wrapped with some metadata.


      Each request body must be an object with a `data` key containing at least a `type` member. The value of the `type` member must agree with the `type` of the entities represented by the endpoint. If not, a **409 Conflict** will be returned.


      The request should also contain an `attributes` member with an object containing the key-value pairs to be created/updated.


      **PUT/PATCH** requests must also have an `id` key that matches the ID part of the endpoint you are making a request to. If the `id` key does not match the ID part of the URL path, a **409 Conflict** error will be returned.


      #### Creating a Node via POST Example


          POST /v2/nodes/
          {
            "data": {
              "type": "nodes",
              "attributes": {
                "title" : "A Phylogenetic Tree of Famous Internet Cats",
                "category" : "project",
                "description" : "How closely related are Grumpy Cat and C.H. Cheezburger? Is memefulness inheritable?"
              }
            }
          }


      #### Updating a User via PUT Example


          PUT /v2/users/me/
          {
            "data": {
              "id": "3rqxc",
              "type": "users",
              "attributes": {
                "full_name" : "Henrietta Swan Leavitt",
                "given_name" : "Henrietta",
                "middle_names" : "Swan",
                "family_name" : "Leavitt"
              }
            }
          }


      **Note:** If you PUT/PATCH to the `/users/me/` endpoint, you must still provide your full user id in the `id` field of the request.  We do not support using the `me` alias in request bodies at this time.


      #### PUT vs. PATCH


      For most endpoints that support updates via **PUT** requests, we also allow **PATCH** updates.


      **PUT** requests require all mandatory attributes to be set, even if their value is unchanged. **PATCH** requests may omit mandatory attributes, whose value will be unchanged.
    name: Request Formatting
    x-traitTag: true
  - description: >-
      ## Errors


      When a request fails for any reason, the OSF API will return an appropriate HTTP response code and include a descriptive error in the body of the response.


      The response body will be a JSON object with a key, `errors`, pointing to an array of error objects.


      In general, these error objects will consist of a `detail` key with a detailed error message and a `source` object that may contain a field `pointer` that is a [JSON Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) to the error-causing attribute.


      The `error` objects may include additional information in accordance with the [JSON-API error spec](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#error-objects).


      #### Example


      An error response from an incorrect create node request:


          {
            "errors": [
              {
                "source": {
                  "pointer": "/data/attributes/category"
                },
                "detail": "This field is required."
              },
              {
                "source": {
                  "pointer": "/data/type"
                },
                "detail": "This field may not be null."
              },
              {
                "source": {
                  "pointer": "/data/attributes/title"
                },
                "detail": "This field is required."
              }
            ]
          }


      ## Error Codes


      The OSF API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.


      In general, codes in the `2xx` range indicate success, codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, invalid authentication credentials were provided, etc.), and codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with our API servers (these are rare, and if they occur consistently, should be [reported](mailto:support@osf.io)).


      `200` **OK**


      The request was successful and everything worked as expected.


      `201` **Created**


      The request was successful and a new resource was created. The newly created resource can be referenced by the ID returned in the response.


      `204` **No Content**


      The request was sucessful but does not need to return an entity-body.


      `400` **Bad Request**


      The request was unacceptable, often due to a missing required parameter or malformed data.


      `401` **Unauthorized**


      The request requires user authentication, which was not provided.


      `403` **Forbidden**


      The request was understood but not fulfilled, most likely due to invalid permissions.


      `404` **Not Found**


      The requested resource does not exist.


      `405` **Method Not Allowed**


      The method specified in the request is not allowed for the resource.


      `409` **Conflict**


      The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource or within the request data.


      `410` **Gone**


      The requested resource is no longer available, most likely because it was deleted.


      `429` **Too Many Requests**


      The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time.


      Wait at least the amount of time specified in the `Retry-After` header of the response before sending another request.


      Authenticated requests have a rate limit of 10,000/day.


      Unauthenticated requests have a rate limit of 100/hour.


      `5xx` **Server Errors**


      The API server encountered an unexpected error.

      ## Entities


      An entity is a single resource that has been retrieved from the API, usually from an endpoint with the entity's ID as the final path part. A successful response from an entity request will be a JSON object with a top level `data` key pointing to a sub-object with the following members:


      #### ID


      The identifier for the entity.  This **MUST** be included with all PUT and PATCH requests.


      #### Type


      The type identifier of this entity.  This **MUST** be included with all create and update requests.


      #### Attributes


      The properties of the entity.  Names, descriptions, etc.


      #### Relationships


      Relationships are URLs to other entities or entity collections that have a relationship to the entity.


      For example, the node entity provides a `contributors` relationship that points to the endpoint to retrieve all contributors to that node. It is recommended to use these links rather than to filter general entity collection endpoints by IDs. They'll be faster, easier, and less error-prone.


      Generally a relationship will have the following structure:


          {relationship_name}: {
            "links": {
              "related": {
                "href": {url_to_related_entity_or_entity_collection},
                "meta": {}
              }
            }
          }


      If there are no related entities, `href` will be null.


      #### Embeds


      Please see the [embedding](#tag/Embedding) documentation.


      #### Links


      Links are urls to alternative representations of the entity or actions that may be performed on the entity.


      Most entities will provide a `self` link that is the canonical endpoint for the entity where update and delete requests should be sent. Most entities will also provide an `html` link that directs to the entity's page on the Open Science Framework.


      ## Entity Collections


      Entity collection endpoints return a list of entities and an additional data structure with pagination links, such as `next`, `prev`, `first`, and `last`.


      The OSF API limits all entity collection responses to a maximum of 10 entities.


      The response object has two keys:


      #### Data


      The `data` key is an array of entities that match the query.


      Each entity in the array is the same representation that is returned from that entity's `self` link, meaning that refetching the entity is unnecessary.


      #### Links


      The `links` key contains pagination information, including links to the previous, next, first, and last pages of results.


      The `meta` key contains the total number of entities available, as well as the current number of results displayed per page.


      If there are only enough results to fill one page, the `first`, `last`, `prev`, and `next` values will be null.

      #### 2.16

        + Starts serializing `subjects` as relationships, to better adhere to JSON-API.
        Pre-2.16, `subjects` are serialized as attributes.

      #### 2.15

      + Deprecates ApplicationReset view (/v2/applications/<client_id>/reset/). Instead, to reset the client secret for an OAuth application, PATCH the `client_secret` property on the ApplicationDetail view (/v2/applications/<client_id>/)

      #### 2.14

      + Deprecates the `logo_path` field off of the InstitutionSerializer.


      #### 2.13


      + Resource types for Resource Object Identifiers have been corrected for these relationsips:
          + `nodes.linked_nodes` (was `type: linked_nodes`, now: `type: nodes`)
          + `nodes.linked_registrations` (was `type: linked_registrations`, now: `type: registrations`)
          + `registrations.linked_nodes` (was `type: linked_nodes`, now: `type: nodes`)
          + `registrations.linked_registrations` (was `type: linked_registrations`, now: `type: registrations`)
          + `collections.linked_nodes` (was `type: linked_nodes`, now: `type: nodes`)
          + `collections.linked_registrations` (was `type: linked_registrations`, now: `type: registrations`)
          + `collections.linked_preprints` (was `type: linked_preprints`, now: `type: preprints`)
          + `preprints.node` (was `type: linked_preprint_nodes`, now: `type: nodes`)


      #### 2.12


      + DELETE requests to a node detail will also delete all the node's subcomponents.


      #### 2.11


      + Only return the permissions explicitly assigned to the current user in `current_user_permissions`.
          + No longer automatically return `read` for all public nodes.


      #### 2.10


      + Return and require lists for the following `social` fields:
          + `github`
          + `twitter`
          + `linkedIn`
          + `profileWebsites`


      #### 2.9


      + Return `null` for all empty relationships instead of ommitting them entirely.


      + Deprecate the `metaschemas/registrations` endpoint in favor of `schemas/registrations`.


      #### 2.8


      + Deprecate the `preprint_providers` endpoint in favor of `providers/preprints`.


      + /data/relationships/wikis not shown in node data when the wiki is disabled for that project/component.


      #### 2.7


      + Require `type` and `id` for all PATCH requests.


      #### 2.6


      + Deprecate the [**Taxonomy List**](#tag/Taxonomies) endpoint.


      #### 2.5


      + Deprecate the `subjects_acceptable` field in the **Preprint Provider** serializer.


      #### 2.4


      + Deprecate the `parents` field in the **Taxonomies** serializer.


      + Deprecate the following fields in the **Preprint Provider** serializer:
          + `social_facebook`, `social_instagram`, and `social_twitter`
          + `banner_path`, `logo_path`, and `header_text`
          + `email_contact`


      #### 2.3


      + Handle merged users more correctly on `/v2/users/`.


      #### 2.2


      + Modify institution nodes list so that affiliated components are also returned from `/v2/institutions/<id>/nodes/`.


      + Ensure all existing date fields are standardized on UTC.


      #### 2.1


      + Pagination links conform to JSON API specification, i.e. `meta` information was pulled out of the `links` object and placed in a top-level `meta` object.


      + Deprecate the `node_links` field in the **Node** and **Registration** serializers in favor of `linked_nodes` and `linked_registrations`.

      OSF public resources and partner institutions can queried via the
      `/v2/search/` endpoint. The search endpoint will return a serialized JSON
      representation of the queried object.

      OSF search uses the [Lucene search syntax](http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Search+Application+Query+Syntax) .This gives you many options, but can be very simple as well. Examples of valid searches include:

       - https://osf.io/search/?q=repro*
       - https://osf.io/search/?q=brian+AND+title:many
       - https://osf.io/search/?q=tags:(psychology)

    get:

        A paginated list of all standard citation styles available for
        rendering citations.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of 10 citation styles. Each resource in the array is a separate citation syle and contains the full representation of the citation style object.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        This request should never return an error.


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include citation styles that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/citations/styles/?filter[title]=open.


        Citation styles may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `short-title`, and `summary`.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

        Draft registrations contain the supplemental registration questions that accompany a registration. A registration is a frozen version of the project that can never be edited or deleted, but can be withdrawn.


        Your original project remains editable but will now have the draft registration linked to it.


        #### Permissions


        Only project administrators may view draft registrations.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the requested draft registration, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        Update a draft registration by answering the supplemental
        registration questions. This is the second step in creating a
        registration. The answers will go under registration_metadata.
        Registration_metadata must be a dictionary with keys as question ids in
        the registration form, and values as nested dictionaries matching the
        specific format in the registration metaschema.

        [To retrieve the format of a certain registration schema](#operation/registration_metaschemas_read)


        If a question is multiple-choice, the question response must exactly match one of the possible choices.


        Refer to step 1: [How to create a draft registration](#operation/nodes_draft_registrations_create)


        Refer to step 3: [How to create a registration from a completed draft registration](#operation/nodes_registrations_create)

        Retrieves the details of a file (or folder)


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the metadata for the requested file or folder. If a metadata request is issued against a folder, the request will return the metadata for every object in the folder. If the ?info= query parameter is present for a request against a folder, the response will contain the metadata for the folder itself instead of the metadata for the objects in the folder.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.


        ### Waterbutler API actions


        Files can be modified via the Waterbutler URLs found in the `links` key of the response (new_folder, move, upload, download, and delete). Further information about how to interact with files can be found in the [Waterbutler API documentation](https://waterbutler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#v1-api).



        #### Download (files)


        To download a file, issue a GET request against the download link. The response will have the Content-Disposition header set, which will will trigger a download in a browser.


        #### Create Subfolder (folders)


        You can create a subfolder of an existing folder by issuing a PUT request against the new_folder link. The ?kind=folder portion of the query parameter is already included in the new_folder link. The name of the new subfolder should be provided in the name query parameter. The response will contain a WaterButler folder entity. If a folder with that name already exists in the parent directory, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response.


        #### Upload New File (folders)


          To upload a file to a folder, issue a PUT request to the folder's upload link with the raw file data in the request body, and the kind and name query parameters set to 'file' and the desired name of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the new file. If a file with the same name already exists in the folder, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response.


        #### Update Existing File (file)


        To update an existing file, issue a PUT request to the file's upload link with the raw file data in the request body and the kind query parameter set to "file". The update action will create a new version of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the updated file.


        #### Rename (files, folders)


        To rename a file or folder, issue a POST request to the move link with the action body parameter set to "rename" and the rename body parameter set to the desired name. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name.


        #### Move & Copy (files, folders)


        Move and copy actions both use the same request structure, a POST to the move url, but with different values for the action body parameters. The path parameter is also required and should be the OSF path attribute of the folder being written to. The rename and conflict parameters are optional. If you wish to change the name of the file or folder at its destination, set the rename parameter to the new name. The conflict param governs how name clashes are resolved. Possible values are replace and keep. replace is the default and will overwrite the file that already exists in the target folder. keep will attempt to keep both by adding a suffix to the new file's name until it no longer conflicts. The suffix will be ' (x)' where x is a increasing integer starting from 1. This behavior is intended to mimic that of the OS X Finder. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name.

        Files and folders can also be moved between nodes and providers. The resource parameter is the id of the node under which the file/folder should be moved. It must agree with the path parameter, that is the path must identify a valid folder under the node identified by resource. Likewise, the provider parameter may be used to move the file/folder to another storage provider, but both the resource and path parameters must belong to a node and folder already extant on that provider. Both resource and provider default to the current node and providers.

        If a moved/copied file is overwriting an existing file, a 200 OK response will be returned. Otherwise, a 201 Created will be returned.

        *NOTE* This feature is experimental and subject to change at any
        time. It may only be available on certain environments.


        A paginated list of groups.  Only groups the logged-in user belongs to will be returned. The returned groups are sorted by their `date_modified`, with the most recently updated groups appearing first.


        #### Returns

        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of 10 groups. Each resource in the array is a separate group object and contains the full representation of the group, meaning additional requests to a group's detail view are not necessary.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include groups that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/groups/5c0571f4b146c900085f39a3/?filter[name]=lab.


        Groups may be filtered by their `name`.

        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

        Creates a new group.

        On the OSF, a group is a collection of users; examples are a lab group or a class. Users can add other users to groups, and then allow that group to access a project or several projects.

        #### Required

        Required fields for creating a group include:


        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`name`


        Note: The creator is automatically made a manager of the group.

        #### Returns

        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the created group, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        time. It may only be available on certain environments.


        Updates a group by setting the values of the attributes specified in the request body. Any unspecified attributes will be left unchanged.


        Groups can be updated with either a **PUT** or **PATCH** request. The `name` field is mandatory in a **PUT** request, and optional in a **PATCH**.


        #### Permissions

        Only managers of a group may update the group. Attempting to update a group for which you do not have manager access will result in a **403 Forbidden** response.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated node, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        A paginated list of the group members.

        Groups are collections of users. A user can either be a group member or a group manager. Group managers can update group membership. All group members can be added as a unit to a project or several projects.

        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of 10 members. Each resource in the array contains the full representation of the member, meaning additional requests to a member's detail view are not necessary. The user's role in the group and full_name are top-level attributes. Additionally, if a member hasn't yet claimed their OSF account, they will have an unregistered_member attribute.  To see more details about the user in the group, follow the `users` relationship.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Filtering

        You can optionally request that the response only include members that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/groups/5c0571f4b146c900085f39a3/members/?filter[role]=manager.


        Contributors may be filtered by their `role` and `full_name` attributes.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

        Adds a member to a group, effectively creating a relationship between the group and a user.

        Groups are collections of users. A user can either be a group member or a group manager. Group managers can update group membership. All group members can be added as a unit to a project or several projects.

        #### Permissions

        Only a group manager can add a member to the group.

        #### Required

        A relationship object with a `data` key, containing the `users` type and valid user ID is required.  You can specify the member's role with the `role` attribute. Default role is `member`.  To add an unregistered member to a group, specify a `full_name` and `email` combination under `attributes`.

        #### Returns

        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the new group member, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        Removes a member from a group. This request only removes the relationship between the group and the user, it does not delete the user itself.


        A group must always have at least one manager, and attempting to remove the only manager from a group will result in a **400 Bad Request** response.

        #### Permissions

        A user can remove themselves as a member. Otherwise, only project managers can remove members.

        #### Returns

        If the request is successful, no content is returned.


        If the request is unsuccessful, a JSON object with an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        *NOTE* This feature is experimental and subject to change at any
        time. It may only be available on certain environments.


        Updates a group member by setting the values of the attributes specified in the request body. Any unspecified attributes will be left unchanged.


        Group members can be updated with either a **PUT** or **PATCH** request. Since this endpoint has no mandatory attributes, PUT and PATCH are functionally the same.

        #### Permissions

        Only group managers can update group membership.

        #### Returns

        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated contributor, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.


        If the given user is not already in the member list, a 404 Not Found error will be returned. A group must always have at least one manager, and any attempt to downgrade the permissions of a sole manager will result in a 400 Bad Request error.

        A paginated list of all verified institutions.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of 10 institutions. Each resource in the array is a separate institution object.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        This request should never return an error.


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include institutions that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/institutions/?filter[id]=cos.


        Institutions may be filtered by their `id`, `name`, and `auth_url`


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

        #### Versioning


        As of version `2.2`, affiliated components (in addition to affiliated top-level projects) are returned from this endpoint.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of 10 nodes. Each resource in the array is a separate nodes object.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include nodes that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/institutions/cos/nodes?filter[title]=science.


        Nodes may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `category`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, `contributors`, and `preprint`.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

        institution.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of 10 registrations. Each resource in the array is a separate users object.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include registrations that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/institutions/cos/registrations?filter[title]=science.


        Registrations may be filtered by their  `id`, `title`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `category`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, `contributors`, and `preprint`

    get:

        A paginated list of licenses. The returned licenses are sorted by
        their name.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of 10 licenses. Each resource in the array is a separate license object and contains the full representation of the license, meaning additional requests to a license's detail view are not necessary.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        This request should never return an error.


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include licenses that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. [https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/?filter[name]=apache](https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/?filter[name]=apache).


        Licenses may be filtered by their `id`, and `name`.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

    get:
      description: >-
        A paginated list of nodes, representing projects and components, on
        the OSF.


        The returned nodes are those which are public or which the user has access to view.


        The returned nodes are sorted by their `date_modified`, with the most recently updated nodes appearing first.


        Registrations cannot be accessed through this endpoint (use the [registrations](#tag/Registrations) endpoints instead).


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of 10 nodes. Each resource in the array is a separate node object and contains the full representation of the node, meaning additional requests to a node's detail view are not necessary.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        This request should never return an error.


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include nodes that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/?filter[title]=reproducibility.


        Nodes may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, `preprint`, and `contributors`.


        Most fields are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching. Public and preprint are boolean fields, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as **true**, **false**, **0** or **1**. Note that quoting true or false in the query will cause the match to fail.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

        Creates a new node.


        On the OSF, nodes are considered **projects** or **components**. The difference between a project and a component is that a project is a top-level node, and a component is a child of a project.


        Additionally, nodes have a `category` field that includes **project** as an option. The categorization determines what icon is displayed with the node on the OSF, and helps with search organization. Projects (top-level nodes) may have a category other than project, and components (children) may have a category of **project**.

        #### Required

        Required fields for creating a node include:


        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`title`

        Updates a node by setting the values of the attributes specified in
        the request body. Any unspecified attributes will be left unchanged.


        Nodes can be updated with either a **PUT** or **PATCH** request. The `title` and `category` fields are mandatory in a **PUT** request, and optional in a **PATCH**.


        #### Permissions


        Only write contributors may update a node. Attempting to update a node for which you do not have write access will result in a **403 Forbidden** response.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated node, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of at most 10 addon objects. Each resource in the array is a separate addon object and contains the full representation of the addon, meaning additional requests to a addon's detail view are not necessary.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        #### Permissions


        NodeSettings that are attached to public nodes will give read-only access to everyone. Private nodes require explicit read permission. Write and admin access are the same for public and private nodes. Administrators on a parent node have implicit read permissions for all child nodes.


        Any users with write or admin access to the node are able to deauthorize an enabled addon, but only the addon authorizer is able to change the configuration (i.e. selected folder) of an already-configured NodeSettings entity.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the details of the requested addon, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        Updates a node addon by setting the values of the attributes
        specified in the request body. Any unspecified attributes will be left
        unchanged.


        Node addon can be updated with either a **PUT** or **PATCH** request. The `external_account_id`, `enabled`, and `folder_id` fields are mandatory in a **PUT**, and optional in **PATCH**. Non-string values will be accepted and stringified, however we make no promises about the stringification output.


        To delete or deauthorize a node addon, issue a **PUT** with all fields set to `null` or `False`, or a **PATCH** with enabled set `False`.


        #### Permissions


        NodeSettings that are attached to public nodes will give read-only access to everyone. Private nodes require explicit read permission. Write and admin access are the same for public and private nodes. Administrators on a parent node have implicit read permissions for all child nodes.


        Any users with write or admin access to the node are able to deauthorize an enabled addon, but only the addon authorizer is able to change the configuration (i.e. selected folder) of an already-configured NodeSettings entity.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated node addon, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        Folders are visible only to the user that authorized the addon.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of addon folder objects. Each resource in the array is a separate addon folder object and contains the full representation of the addon folder, meaning additional requests to a addon folder's detail view are not necessary.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        A paginated list of the next level child nodes for the given node.
        The returned nodes are sorted by their `date_modified`, with the most
        recently updated child nodes appearing first.


        The list will include child nodes that are public, as well as child nodes that are private, if the authenticated user has permission to view them.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 child nodes. If the given node has zero child nodes, the `data` key will contain an empty array. Each resource in the array is a separate node object and contains the full representation of the child node, meaning additional requests to the child node's detail view are not necessary.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        This request should never return an error.


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include nodes that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ezcuj/children/?filter[title]=reproducibility.


        Nodes may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, `preprint`, and `contributors`.


        Most fields are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching. Public and preprint are boolean fields, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as **true**, **false**, **0** or **1**. Note that quoting true or false in the query will cause the match to fail.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

                          description: Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to
                            which it characterizes current research is unknown.
                            We conducted replications of 100 experimental and
                            correlational studies published in three psychology
                            journals using high-powered designs and original
                            materials when available. Replication effects were
                            half the magnitude of original effects, representing
                            a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of
                            original studies had statistically significant
                            results. Thirty-six percent of replications had
                            statistically significant results; 47% of original
                            effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of
                            the replication effect size; 39% of effects were
                            subjectively rated to have replicated the original
                            result; and if no bias in original results is
                            assumed, combining original and replication results
                            left 68% with statistically significant effects.
                            Correlational tests suggest that replication success
                            was better predicted by the strength of original
                            evidence than by characteristics of the original and
                            replication teams.

        Creates a new child node.


        Note: Creating a child node via this endpoint will function the same as creating a node via the node list endpoint, but the child node will have the given node set as its parent.


        #### Permissions


        Only write contributors may create children nodes.


        #### Required


        Required fields for creating a node include:


        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`title`


        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`category`


        Note: nodes default to **private** unless the `public` field is explicitly set to **true** in the request payload.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the created node, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        A paginated list of comments related to a given node.


        The returned comments are sorted by their creation date, with the most recent comments appearing first.


        #### Permissions


        Comments on public nodes are given read-only access to everyone.


        If the node comment-level is `private`, only contributors have permission to comment.


        If the comment-level is `public`, any logged-in OSF user can comment.


        Comments on private nodes are only visible to contributors and administrators on the parent node.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of comment objects. Each resource in the array is a separate comment object.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include comments that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ezcuj/comments/?filter[target_id]=jg7sezmdnt93


        Nodes may be filtered by their `deleted`, `target_id`, `date_created`, `date_modified`.


        Most fields are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching. Public and preprint are boolean fields, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as **true**, **false**, **0** or **1**. Note that quoting `true` or `false` in the query will cause the match to fail.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

                            We have published a Bayesian reanalysis of this project at PLOS ONE:
                            http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0149794



                            I explain some of the context on my blog: http://alexanderetz.com/2016/02/26/the-bayesian-rpp-take-2/



                            Please note that the analysis we use in this paper is very different from the analysis used in the blog I posted in the previous comment, so the results are different as well.

                            the Reproducibility Project that gives a graded
                            measure of replication success. In an attempt to
                            avoid dichotomous success/fail replication outcomes,
                            I calculate a continous outcome (Bayes factor) that
                            answers the question, does the replication result
                            fit more with the original reported effect or a null
                            effect? Many replications are strong successes, many
                            are strong failures, and there are many that lie
                            somewhere in between.

        Create a comment on a given node overview page or a reply to a
        comment on that node.


        To create a comment on the node overview page, the target `type` would be "nodes" and the target `id` would be the node `id`.


        To reply to a comment on this node, the target `type` would be "comments" and the target `id` would be the `id` of the comment to reply to.


        #### Required


        A relationship object with a `data` key, containing the target (`comments` or `nodes`) type and a target `id` is required.


        In addition, the `content` attribute describing the relationship between the node and the comment is required.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object with a data key containing the representation of the new comment, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

  "/nodes/{node_id}/contributors/":
    get:
      description: >-
        A paginated list of the node's contributors, sorted by their index.


        Contributors are users who can make changes to the node or, in the case of private nodes, have read access to the node.


        Contributors are categorized as either "bibliographic" or "non-bibliographic". From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are listed on the project overview page on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not.


        Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used to view the list of contributors, the user relationship will not be exposed and the contributor ID will be an empty string.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of 10 contributors. Each resource in the array contains the full representation of the contributor, meaning additional requests to a contributor's detail view are not necessary. Additionally, the full representation of the user this contributor represents is automatically embedded within the `data` key of the response.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include contributors that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y9jdt/contributors/?filter[bibliographic]=true.


        Contributors may be filtered by their `bibliographic` and `permission` attributes.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

        Adds a contributor to a node, effectively creating a relationship
        between the node and a user.


        Contributors are users who can make changes to the node or, in the case of private nodes, have read access to the node.


        Contributors are categorized as either "bibliographic" or "non-bibliographic" contributors. From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are listed on the project overview page on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not.

        #### Permissions

        Only project administrators can add contributors to a node.

        #### Required

        A relationship object with a `data` key, containing the `users` type and valid user ID is required.


        All attributes describing the relationship between the node and the user are optional.

        #### Returns

        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the new contributor, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        Removes a contributor from a node. This request only removes the
        relationship between the node and the user, it does not delete the user
        itself.


        A node must always have at least one admin, and attempting to remove the only admin from a node will result in a **400 Bad Request** response.

        #### Permissions

        A user can remove themselves as a node contributor. Otherwise, only project administrators can remove contributors.

        #### Returns

        If the request is successful, no content is returned.


        If the request is unsuccessful, a JSON object with an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        Updates a contributor by setting the values of the attributes
        specified in the request body. Any unspecified attributes will be left
        unchanged.


        Contributors can be updated with either a **PUT** or **PATCH** request. Since this endpoint has no mandatory attributes, PUT and PATCH are functionally the same.

        #### Permissions

        Only project administrators can update the contributors on a node.

        #### Returns

        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated contributor, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.


        If the given user is not already in the contributor list, a 404 Not Found error will be returned. A node must always have at least one admin, and any attempt to downgrade the permissions of a sole admin will result in a 400 Bad Request error.

        A paginated list of all of the draft registrations of a given node.


        Draft registrations contain the supplemental registration questions that accompany a registration. A registration is a frozen version of the project that can never be edited or deleted, but can be withdrawn.


        Your original project remains editable but will now have the draft registration linked to it.


        #### Permissions


        Only project administrators may view draft registrations.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of 10 draft registrations. Each resource in the array is a separate draft registration object and contains the full representation of the draft registration, meaning additional requests to a draft registration's detail view are not necessary.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        Initiate a draft registration of the current node.

        Draft registrations contain the supplemental registration questions that accompany a registration. A registration is a frozen version of the project that can never be edited or deleted, but can be withdrawn. It is the first step in creating a registration.


        Refer to step 2: [How to complete the supplemental registration questions of a draft registration](#operation/nodes_draft_registrations_partial_update)


        Refer to step 3: [How to create a registration from a completed draft registration](#operation/nodes_registrations_create)


        Your original project remains editable but will now have the draft registration linked to it.

        #### Permissions

        Only project administrators may create draft registrations.

        #### Required

        Required fields for creating a draft registration include:


        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`registration_schema`

        #### Returns

        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the created draft registration, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

    patch:
      description: >-
        Update a draft registration by answering the supplemental
        registration questions. This is the second step in creating a
        registration. The answers will go under registration_metadata.
        Registration_metadata must be a dictionary with keys as question ids in
        the registration form, and values as nested dictionaries matching the
        specific format in the registration metaschema.


        [To view all active registration schemas](#operation/registration_metaschemas_list)


        [To retrieve the format of a certain registration schema](#operation/registration_metaschemas_read)


        If a question is multiple-choice, the question response must exactly match one of the possible choices.


        Refer to step 1: [How to create a draft registration](#operation/nodes_draft_registrations_create)


        Refer to step 3: [How to create a registration from a completed draft registration](#operation/nodes_registrations_create)


        #### Permissions

        Only project administrators may update draft registrations.

        #### Returns

        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated draft registration, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        List of all storage providers that are configured for this node


        Users of the OSF may access their data on a [number of cloud-storage services](https://api.osf.io/v2/#storage-providers) that have integrations with the OSF. We call these **providers**. By default, every node has access to the OSF-provided storage but may use as many of the supported providers as desired.



        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of files. Each resource in the array is a separate file object.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        Note: In the OSF filesystem model, providers are treated as folders, but with special properties that distinguish them from regular folders. Every provider folder is considered a root folder, and may not be deleted through the regular file API.

    get:
      description: >-
        List of all the files/folders that are attached to your project for
        a given storage provider.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of files. Each resource in the array is a separate file object and contains the full representation of the file.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include files that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ezcuj/files/osfstorage/?filter[kind]=file


        Node files may be filtered by `id`, `name`, `kind`, `path`, `provider`, `size`, and `last_touched`.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).


        ### Waterbutler API actions


        Files can be modified via the Waterbutler URLs found in the `links` key of the response (new_folder, move, upload, download, and delete). Further information about how to interact with files can be found in the [Waterbutler API documentation](https://waterbutler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#v1-api).

    get:
      description: >-
        
        A paginated list of the current node's forks. The returned fork nodes are sorted by their `forked_date`, with the most recently forked nodes appearing first.


        Forking a project creates a copy of an existing node and all of its contents. The fork always points back to the original node, forming a network of nodes.

        #### Returns

        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 forked nodes. If the current node has zero forked nodes, the `data` key will contain an empty array. Each resource in the array is a separate node object and contains the full representation of the forked node, meaning additional requests to the forked node's detail view are not necessary.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        This request should never return an error.

        Creates a fork of the given node.


        Forking a project creates a copy of an existing node and all of its contents. The fork always points back to the original node, forming a network of nodes.


        You might use a fork to copy another's work to build on and extend. For example, a professor may create an OSF project of materials for individual student use. Each student forks the project to have his or her own copy of the materials to start his/her own work.


        When creating a fork, your fork will only contain public components of the current node and components for which you are a contributor. Private components that you do not have access to will not be forked.


        #### Required


        There are no required attributes when creating a fork, as all of the forked node's attributes will be copied from the current node.


        The `title` field is optional, with the default title being "Fork of " prepended to the current node's title.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the complete srepresentation of the forked node, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        Groups are collections of users that can be added to a node.  All members of the group will be granted the same permission to the node.

        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of 10 groups. Each resource in the array contains the full representation of the group, meaning additional requests to a group's detail view are not necessary.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include groups that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y9jdt/groups/?filter[admin]=true.


        Node Groups may be filtered by their `name` and `permission` attributes.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

        Adds a group to a node, effectively creating a relationship between the node and a group.


        Groups are collections of users that can be added to a node.  All members of the group will be granted the same permission to the node.

        #### Permissions

        Only group managers that also have admin permissions to a node, can add a group to a node.

        #### Required

        A relationship object with a `data` key, containing the `groups` type and valid group ID is required.


        All attributes describing the relationship between the group and the node are optional.

        #### Returns

        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the new node group, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        Removes a group from a node. This request only removes the relationship between the node and the group, it does not delete the group itself.


        A node must always have at least one admin, and attempting to remove the only admin from a node will result in a **400 Bad Request** response.

        #### Permissions

        A manager of the group or a project administrator can remove the group from the node.


        #### Returns

        If the request is successful, no content is returned.


        If the request is unsuccessful, a JSON object with an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        Retrieves the details of a given node group.


        Groups are collections of users that can be added to a node.  All members of the group will be granted the same permission to the node.

        #### Returns

        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the requested contributor, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        *NOTE* This feature is experimental and subject to change at any
        time. It may only be available on certain environments.


        Updates the permission the group has to the node.

        Node groups can be updated with either a **PUT** or **PATCH** request. Since this endpoint has no mandatory attributes, PUT and PATCH are functionally the same.

        #### Permissions

        Only project administrators can update the permissions a group has to the node.

        #### Returns

        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated contributor, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.


        If the given group is not already in the group list, a 404 Not Found error will be returned.

        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of identifiers. Each resource in the array is a separate identifier object.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include nodes that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ezcuj/identifiers/?filter[category]=doi


        Identifiers may be filtered by their `category` e.g `doi`.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 nodes. Each resource in the array is a separate node object.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include nodes that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/?filter[title]=reproducibility.


        Nodes may be filtered by their `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `registration`, or `tags`. `title`, `description`, and `category` are string fields and will be filteres using simple substring matching. `public`, `registration` are boolean and can be filtered using truthy values, such as `true`, `false`, `0`, `1`. `tags` is an array of simple strings.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

    get:
      description: >-
        A paginated list of all logs associated with a given node.


        The returned logs are sorted by their `date`, with the most recents logs appearing first.


        This list includes the logs of the specified node as well as the logs of that node's children to which the current user has read-only access.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 logs. Each resource in the array is a separate logs object.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include logs that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ezcuj/logs/?filter[action]=made_private.


        Nodes may be filtered by their `action`, and `date`.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 registrations. Each resource in the array is a separate registrations object.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include registrations that match your filters by utilizing the filter query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter[title]=open.


        Registrations may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, and `contributors`.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

        Finalize the registration process of the current draft
        registration. A registration is created from a completed draft
        registration (containing the supplemental registration questions). It
        also needs information about whether the registration will become public
        immediately or be embargoed, and conditionally, the datetime at which
        the registration will become public.


        Refer to step 1: [How to create a draft registration](#operation/nodes_draft_registrations_create)


        Refer to step 2: [How to complete the supplemental registration questions of a draft registration](#operation/nodes_draft_registrations_partial_update)


        A registration is a frozen version of the project that can never be edited or deleted, but can be withdrawn. Your original project remains editable but will now have the registration linked to it.

        #### Permissions

        Only project administrators may create registrations.

        #### Required

        Required fields for creating a registration include:


        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`draft_registration`



        #### Optional

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`included_node_ids` (If left unspecified all child nodes will be registered).


        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`embargo_end_date` (Does not need to be specified, unless registration is embargoed).


        #### Returns

        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the created registration, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the requested node settings, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.


        #### Permissions


        Settings for a node are readable by users that are contributors on the node. Most fields are writeable only by users that are administrators on the node. The fields for determining redirect links are writable by a contributor who has read/write permissions on the node.

        List of view only links on a node.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 view only links. Each resource in the array is a view only link object.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Permissions


        View only links on a node, public or private, are readable and writeable only by users that are administrators on the node.


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include view only links that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ezcuj/view_only_links/?filter[anonymous]=true.


        View Only Links may be filtered based on their `name`, `anonymous` and `date_created` fields. Possible comparison operators include 'gt' (greater than), 'gte'(greater than or equal to), 'lt' (less than) and 'lte' (less than or equal to). The date must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD and the time is optional.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

    get:

        List of wiki pages on a node.

        #### Returns


        Paginated list of the node's current wiki pages, ordered by their date_modified. Each resource contains the full representation of the wiki, meaning additional requests to an individual wiki's detail view are not necessary.


        Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used, the user relationship will not be exposed.


        If the request is unsuccessful, a JSON object with an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.


        #### Filtering


        Wiki pages can be filtered based on their `name` and `date_modified` fields.


        + `filter[name]=<Str>` -- filter wiki pages by name


        + `filter[date_modified][comparison_operator]=YYYY-MM-DDTH:M:S` -- filter wiki pages based on date modified.


        Possible comparison operators include 'gt' (greater than), 'gte'(greater than or equal to), 'lt' (less than) and 'lte' (less than or equal to). The date must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD and the time is optional.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

        Creates a new wiki page on the given node.

        `name` is the only required field when creating a new wiki page. The `content` of the wiki page may optionally be included.


        This POST request creates a wiki page, and then creates a first version for the wiki - adding your content to the first version. For subsequent updates to this wiki page, POST to the versions relationship.  This will create new versions of this wiki. For more information, see [Update a wiki](#operation/wiki_versions_create).


        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the created wiki, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

    get:
      description: >-
        A paginated list of preprints from all preprint providers. The
        returned preprints are sorted by their creation date, with the most
        recent preprints appearing first.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of 10 preprints. Each resource in the array is a separate preprint object.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        This request should never return an error.


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include preprints that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/?filter[provider]=socarxiv.


        Preprints may be filtered by their `id`, `is_published`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, and `provider`.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

        Creates a new preprint.  Initial request to start the preprint
        requires a title and a provider.


        After you've created the preprint, you will need to upload a file to the preprint or copy a file from an existing OSF project, which will be a waterbutler request.


        To upload a new file to the preprint -

            1. Make a request to the preprint files' relationship to get the preprint's upload link.
            2. Issue a PUT request to the preprint's upload link

            curl -X "PUT" "https://files.us.osf.io/v1/resources/<preprint_id>/providers/osfstorage/?kind=file&name=my_preprint_file.txt" \
                --
                -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token-goes-here" \
                -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
                -d "Contents of my preprint file go here"

        To copy an existing file from a project to your preprint -

            1. Make a request to the node file's list endpoint GET http://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/node_id/files/osfstorage/
            2. Locate the "move" relationship link for the file you wish to copy from the node to the preprint
            3. Issue a POST request to the file's move link, where the resource is the preprint id, the action is copy, and the provider is osfstorage.

            curl -X "POST" "https://files.us.osf.io/v1/resources/<node_id>/providers/osfstorage/<file_id>" \
                --
                -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token-goes-here " \
                -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                -d '{"action": "copy", "path": "/", "resource": "<preprint_id>", "provider": "osfstorage", "conflict": "replace"}'


        #### Returns

        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the created preprint, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes]() to understand why this request may have failed.

      description: >-
        Updates the specified preprint by setting the values of the
        parameters passed. Any parameters not provided will be left unchanged.


        The file that you either uploaded to the preprint or copied from an OSF project to the preprint will need to be set as the primary file before the preprint can be published.


        To remove a supplemental project from a preprint will be a separate PATCH request to the node self relationship link.

        #### Returns

        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated preprint, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes]() to understand why this request may have failed.

        The returned preprint providers are sorted by their creation date, with the most recent preprints appearing first.


        _< v2.8 use `preprint_providers` instead of `providers/preprints`_


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of 10 preprint providers.


        Each resource in the array is a separate preprint provider object.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        This request should never return an error.


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include preprint providers that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/?filter[id]=osf.


        Preprint Providers may be filtered by their `id`, `name`,  and `description`


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include preprints that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/osf/preprints/?filter[is_published]=true.


        Preprints may be filtered by their `id`, `is_published`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, and `provider`.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

  /registrations/:
    get:
      description: >-
        A paginated list of registrations on the OSF to which the user has
        access.


        The returned registrations are those which are public or which the user has access to view.


        Non-registered nodes cannot be accessed through this endpoint (use the [nodes](#Nodes_nodes_list) endpoints instead).


        #### Registrations


        A registration on the OSF creates a frozen, time-stamped version of a project that cannot be edited or deleted. The *original project* can still be edited, while the registered version cannot.


        Registrations can be made public immediately or embargoed for up to 4 years.


        #### Withdrawals


        Registrations cannot be deleted, but they can be withdrawn. Withdrawing a registration removes the content of the registration but leaves behind basic metadata. A withdrawn registration will display a limited subset of information, namely, title, description, date_created, date_registered, date_withdrawn, registration, withdrawn, withdrawal_justification, and registration supplement. All other fields will be displayed as null. Additionally, the only relationship that remains accesible for a withdrawn registration is the contributors. All other relationships will return a **403 Forbidden** response.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of 10 registrations. Each resource in the array is a separate registration object and contains the full representation of the registration, meaning additional requests to a registration's detail view are not necessary.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        This request should never return an error.


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include registrations that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter[title]=open.


        Registrations may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, and `contributors`.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

        Retrieve the details of a given registration.


        #### Permissions


        Only project contributors may retrieve the details of a registration that is embargoed, or has not yet been made public. Attempting to retrieve a private registration for which you are not a contributor will result in a **403 Forbidden** response.


        Authentication is not required to view the details of a public registration, as public registrations give read-only access to everyone.


        #### Registrations


        A registration on the OSF creates a frozen, time-stamped version of a project that cannot be edited or deleted.


        The *original project* can still be edited, while the registered version cannot.


        Registrations can be made public immediately or embargoed for up to 4 years.


        #### Withdrawals


        Registrations cannot be deleted, but they can be withdrawn. Withdrawing a registration removes the content of the registration but leaves behind basic metadata. A withdrawn registration will display a limited subset of information, namely, title, description, date_created, date_registered, date_withdrawn, registration, withdrawn, withdrawal_justification, and registration supplement. All other fields will be displayed as null. Additionally, the only relationship that remains accesible for a withdrawn registration is the contributors. All other relationships will return a **403 Forbidden** response.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the requested registration, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        Registrations can be updated with either a **PUT** or **PATCH**
        request. There are a handful of fields that can be edited by
        registration administrators, and a few fields by users with write
        permissions.

        Note - one of the fields you can edit is `public`. Registrations can only be turned from private to public, not vice versa.


        You may request a registration to be withdrawn by providing a truthy value for `pending_withdrawal` in the data payload, along with an optional `withdrawal_justification`.

        #### Permissions

        Only project administrators may update most fields on a registration, but write contributors can edit certain fields like tags.

        #### Returns

        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated registration, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

    get:
      description: >-
        A paginated list of children of a registration.


        The list consists of the next level child registrations for the given registration. The returned registrations are sorted by their `date_modified`, with the most recently updated child registrations appearing first.


        The list will include child registrations that are public, as well as child registrations that are private, if the authenticated user has permission to view them.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 child registrations. If the given registration has zero child registrations, the `data` key will contain an empty array. Each resource in the array is a separate registration object and contains the full representation of the child registration.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include registrations that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wucr8/children/?filter[title]=reproducibility.


        Registrations may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, and `contributors`.


        Most fields are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching. Public is a boolean field, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as **true**, **false**, **0** or **1**. Note that quoting true or false in the query will cause the match to fail.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

        A paginated list of the registration's alternative citation styles


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 citation styles. Each resource in the array is a separate citation styles object.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include citation styles that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wucr8/citations/?filter[title]=open.


        Citation styles may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `short-title`, and `summary`.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

    get:
      description: >-
        A paginated list of the registration's comments.


        The returned comments are sorted by their creation date, with the most recent comments appearing first.


        #### Permissions


        Comments of public registrations are given read-only access to everyone.


        If the comment-level is `private`, only registration contributors have permission to comment.


        If the comment-level is `public`, any logged-in OSF user can comment.


        Comments of private registrations are only visible to contributors and administrators on the registration.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of comment objects. Each resource in the array is a separate comment object.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include comments that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wuerf/comments/?filter[target]=wuerf


        Comments may be filtered by their `deleted`, `target`, `date_created`, `date_modified`.


        Most fields are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching. Deleted is a boolean field, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as **true**, **false**, **0** or **1**. Note that quoting `true` or `false` in the query will cause the match to fail.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

                            We have published a Bayesian reanalysis of this project at PLOS ONE:
                            http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0149794


                            I explain some of the context on my blog: http://alexanderetz.com/2016/02/26/the-bayesian-rpp-take-2/


                            Please note that the analysis we use in this paper is very different from the analysis used in the blog I posted in the previous comment, so the results are different as well.

                          content: In this blog http://wp.me/p4sgtg-o6 I conduct a Bayesian Re-analysis of
                            the Reproducibility Project that gives a graded
                            measure of replication success. In an attempt to
                            avoid dichotomous success/fail replication outcomes,
                            I calculate a continous outcome (Bayes factor) that
                            answers the question, does the replication result
                            fit more with the original reported effect or a null
                            effect? Many replications are strong successes, many
                            are strong failures, and there are many that lie
                            somewhere in between.

  "/registrations/{registration_id}/contributors/":
    get:
      description: >-
        A paginated list of all contributors on this registration.


        The returned contributors are sorted by their index.


        Contributors are users who can make changes to the registration or, in the case of private registration, have read access to the registration.


        Contributors are categorized as either "bibliographic" or "non-bibliographic". From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are listed in the contributors list on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not.


        Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used to view the list of contributors, the user relationship will not be exposed and the contributor ID will be an empty string.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 contributors. Each resource in the array contains the full representation of the contributor. Additionally, the full representation of the user this contributor represents is automatically embedded within the `data` key of the response.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include contributors that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wu3a4/contributors/?filter[bibliographic]=true.


        Contributors may be filtered by their `bibliographic` and `permission` attributes.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

        A paginated list of storage providers enabled on the registration


        Users of the OSF may access their data on a [number of cloud-storage services](https://api.osf.io/v2/#storage-providers) that have integrations with the OSF. We call these **providers**. By default, every node has access to the OSF-provided storage but may use as many of the supported providers as desired.



        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 files. Each resource in the array is a separate file object.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        Note: In the OSF filesystem model, providers are treated as folders, but with special properties that distinguish them from regular folders. Every provider folder is considered a root folder, and may not be deleted through the regular file API.

        List of all the registration's files/folders for a given storage
        provider.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of files. Each resource in the array is a separate file object and contains the full representation of the file.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include files that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wucr8/files/osfstorage/?filter[kind]=file


        Files may be filtered by `id`, `name`, `kind`, `path`, `provider`, `size`, and `last_touched`.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

    get:
      description: >-
        A paginated list of the registration’s forks


        The returned forks are sorted by their `forked_date`, with the most recent forks appearing first.


        Forking a registration creates a copy of an existing registration and all of its contents.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 forks. If the current registration has no fork, the `data` key will contain an empty array. Each resource in the array is a separate registration object and contains the full representation of the registration's fork.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        Creates a fork of the given registration.


        Forking a project creates a copy of an existing registration and all of its contents. The fork always points back to the original registration, forming a network of registrations.


        You might use a fork to copy another's work to build on and extend. For example, a professor may create an OSF project of materials for individual student use. Each student forks the project to have his or her own copy of the materials to start his/her own work.


        When creating a fork, your fork will only contain public components of the current registration and components for which you are a contributor. Private components that you do not have access to will not be forked.

        #### Required

        There are no required attributes when creating a fork, as all of the forked registration's attributes will be copied from the current registration.


        The `title` field is optional, with the default title being "Fork of " prepended to the current registration's title.

        #### Returns

        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the complete representation of the forked registration, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of identifiers. Each resource in the array is a separate identifier object.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include registrations that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wucr8/identifiers/?filter[category]=doi


        Identifiers may be filtered by their `category` e.g `doi`.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 nodes. Each resource in the array is a separate node object.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include nodes that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wucr8/linked_nodes/?filter[title]=reproducibility/?filter[title]=reproducibility.


        Nodes may be filtered by their `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `registration`, or `tags`. `title`, `description`, and `category` are string fields and will be filteres using simple substring matching. `public`, `registration` are boolean and can be filtered using truthy values, such as `true`, `false`, `0`, `1`. `tags` is an array of simple strings.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

    get:
      description: >-
        A paginated list of the registration's logs.


        The returned logs are sorted by their `date`, with the most recents logs appearing first.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 logs. Each resource in the array is a separate logs object.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include logs that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wucr8/logs/?filter[action]=made_private.


        Logs may be filtered by their `action`, and `date`.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

    get:
      description: >-
        A paginated list of view only links created for this registration.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 view only links. Each resource in the array is a view only link object.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Permissions


        View only links on a registration, public or private, are readable and writeable only by users that are administrators on the registration.


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include view only links that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wu3a4/view_only_links/?filter[anonymous]=true.


        View Only Links may be filtered based on their `name`, `anonymous` and `date_created` fields. Possible comparison operators include 'gt' (greater than), 'gte'(greater than or equal to), 'lt' (less than) and 'lte' (less than or equal to). The date must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD and the time is optional.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

    get:

        A paginated list of the registration's wiki pages


        #### Returns


        A list of all registration's current wiki page versions ordered by their date_modified. Each resource contains the full representation of the wiki, meaning additional requests to an individual wiki's detail view are not necessary.


        If the request is unsuccessful, a JSON object with an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.


        #### Filtering


        Wiki pages can be filtered based on their `name` and `date_modified` fields.


        + `filter[name]=<Str>` -- filter wiki pages by name


        + `filter[date_modified][comparison_operator]=YYYY-MM-DDTH:M:S` -- filter wiki pages based on date modified.


        Possible comparison operators include 'gt' (greater than), 'gte'(greater than or equal to), 'lt' (less than) and 'lte' (less than or equal to). The date must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD and the time is optional.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

        OSF search returns JSON serialized objects (including projects,
        components, registrations, users, files,
         and institutions) that have been found by the given Elasticsearch query. Each object is serialized with the
         appropriate serializer for its type (files are serialized as files, users are serialized as users, etc.) and
         returned collectively.

        #### Permissions

        taxonomies](https://www.bepress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Digital-Commons-Disciplines-taxonomy-2017-01.pdf).


        Note: this API endpoint is under active development, and is subject to change in the future.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 taxonomies. Each resource in the array is a separate taxonomy object.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        This request should never return an error.


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include taxonomies that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/taxonomies/?filter['id']='{taxonomy_id}'.


        Taxonomies may be filtered by their `id`, `parents`, and `text`.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

  /users/:
    get:
      description: >-
        A paginated list of all users registered on the OSF. The returned
        users are sorted by their `date_registered`, with the most recently
        registered users appearing first.


        The subroute `/users/me/` is a special endpoint that always points to the currently logged-in user.


        #### Versioning


        As of version `2.3`, merged users will not be returned from this endpoint.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of 10 users. Each resource in the array is a separate users object and contains the full representation of the user, meaning additional requests to a user's detail view are not necessary.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        This request should never return an error.


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include nodes that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/users/?filter[family_name]=Nosek.


        Users may be filtered by their `id`, `full_name`, `given_name`, `middle_name`, or `family_name`.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

        Updates a user by setting the values of the attributes specified in
        the request body. Any unspecified attributes will be left unchanged.


        Users can be updated with either a **PUT** or **PATCH** request. The `full_name` field is mandatory in a **PUT** request, and optional in a **PATCH**.


        **Note**: if you make a PUT/PATCH request to the `/users/me/` endpoint, you must still provide your full user ID in the ID field of the request. We do not support using the `me` alias in request bodies at this time.

        #### Returns

        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated node, if the request is successful.


        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

    get:

        A paginated list of groups that a user belongs to. The returned
        groups are sorted by their `date_modified`, with the most recently
        updated groups appearing first.

        If the user ID in the path is the same as the logged-in user, all groups will be returned. Otherwise, only the groups that the logged-in user and the requested user both belong to will be returned.

        #### Returns

        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of 10 groups. Each resource in the array is a separate group object and contains the full representation of the group, meaning additional requests to a group's detail view are not necessary.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include groups that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/users/cdi38/groups/?filter[name]=lab.


        Groups may be filtered by their `name`.

        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

    get:
      description: >-
        A paginated list of nodes that the user is a contributor to. The
        returned nodes are sorted by their `date_modified`, with the most
        recently updated nodes appearing first.


        If the user ID in the path is the same as the logged-in user, all nodes will be returned. Otherwise, only the user's public nodes will be returned.


        User registrations are not available at this endpoint.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of 10 nodes. Each resource in the array is a separate node object and contains the full representation of the node, meaning additional requests to a node's detail view are not necessary.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include nodes that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/users/cdi38/nodes/?filter[title]=open.


        Nodes may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, `preprint`, and `contributors`.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

    get:
      description: >-
        A paginated list of preprints that the user contributes to. The
        returned preprints are sorted by their creation date, with the most
        recent preprints appearing first.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of 10 preprints. Each resource in the array is a complete preprint object and contains the full representation of the preprint, meaning additional requests to a preprint's detail view are not necessary.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include preprints that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/users/cdi38/preprints/?filter[provider]=psyarxiv.


        Preprints may be filtered by their `id`, `is_published`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, and `provider`.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).

  "/users/{user_id}/registrations/":
    get:
      description: >-
        A paginated list of registrations that the user is a contributor
        to. The returned registrations are sorted by their `date_modified`, with
        the most recently updated registrations appearing first.


        If the user ID in the path is the same as the logged-in user, all registrations will be returned. Otherwise, only the user's public registrations will be returned.


        User nodes are not available at this endpoint.


        #### Returns


        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


        The `data` key contains an array of 10 registrations. Each resource in the array is a separate registration object and contains the full representation of the registration, meaning additional requests to a registration's detail view are not necessary.


        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


        #### Filtering


        You can optionally request that the response only include registrations that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/users/cdi38/registrations/?filter[title]=replication.


        Registrations may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, and `contributors`.


        You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).
