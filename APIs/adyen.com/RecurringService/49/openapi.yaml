    The Recurring APIs allow you to manage and remove your tokens or saved payment details. Tokens should be created with validation during a payment request.


    For more information, refer to our [Tokenization documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/checkout/tokenization).

    ## Authentication

    To connect to the Recurring API, you must use your basic authentication credentials. For this, create your web service user, as described in [How to get the WS user password](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-web-service-ws-user-password). Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:


    ```

    curl

    -U "ws@Company.YourCompany":"YourWsPassword" \

    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

    ...

    ```

    Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).


    ## Versioning

    Recurring API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.


    For example:

    ```

    https://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Recurring/v49/disable

    ```

            * χ12 is converted to ch12.

            * üA is converted to euA.

            * Peter Møller is converted to Peter Mller, because banks don't accept 'ø'.

            After replacement, the ownerName must have at least three alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), and at least one of them must be a valid Latin character (A-Z, a-z). For example:

            * John17 - allowed.
