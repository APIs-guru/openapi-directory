    The Hosted Onboarding Page (HOP) API provides endpoints for using the Hosted Onboarding Page. The related entities include account holders only. 
    For more information, refer to our [documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/platforms/onboarding-and-verification/hosted-onboarding-page).
    ## Authentication
    To connect to the HOP API, you must use basic authentication credentials of your web service user. If you don't have one, please contact the [Adyen Support Team](https://support.adyen.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:

    ```
    curl
    -U "ws@MarketPlace.YourMarketPlace":"YourWsPassword" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    ...
    ```
    Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).

    ## Versioning
    The HOP API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.

    For example:
    ```
    https://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Hop/v6/getOnboardingUrl
    ```
