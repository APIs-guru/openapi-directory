    The Notification Configuration API provides endpoints for setting up and testing notifications that inform you of events on your platform, for example when a KYC check or a payout has been completed.

    For more information, refer to our [documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/platforms/notifications).
    ## Authentication
    To connect to the Notification Configuration API, you must use basic authentication credentials of your web service user. If you don't have one, contact our [Adyen Support Team](https://support.adyen.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:

    ```
    curl
    -U "ws@MarketPlace.YourMarketPlace":"YourWsPassword" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    ...
    ```
    Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).

    ## Versioning
    The Notification Configuration API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.

    For example:
    ```
    https://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Notification/v5/createNotificationConfiguration
    ```

      description: Creates a subscription to notifications informing you of events on your platform. After the subscription is created, the events specified in the configuration will be sent to the URL specified in the configuration. Subscriptions must be configured on a per-event basis (as opposed to, for example, a per-account holder basis), so all event notifications of a marketplace and of a given type will be sent to the same endpoint(s). A marketplace may have multiple endpoints if desired; an event notification may be sent to as many or as few different endpoints as configured.
