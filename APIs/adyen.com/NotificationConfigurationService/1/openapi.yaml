    The MarketPay Notification Configuration API provides endpoints for configuration a subscription to a marketplace's MarketPay-related notifications. Notifications are sent upon the occurrence of certain events (such as a KYC check completion or a payout completion), and the subscription to these notifications dictates to where they are sent.

    For further information on MarketPay notifications, please visit the [MarketPay documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/marketpay/marketpay-overview).
    ## Authentication
    To connect to the MarketPay API, you must use basic authentication credentials of your web service user. If you don't have one, please contact the [Adyen Support Team](https://support.adyen.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:

    ```
    curl
    -U "ws@Company.YourCompany":"YourWsPassword" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    ...
    ```
    Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/api-reference/live-endpoints).

    ## Versioning
    MarketPay API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.

    For example:
    ```
    https://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Notification/v1/createNotificationConfiguration
    ```

After the subscription is created, the events specified in the configuration will be sent to the URL specified in the configuration. Subscriptions must be configured on a per-event basis (as opposed to, for example, a per-account holder basis), so all event notifications of a marketplace and of a given type will be sent to the same endpoint(s). A marketplace may have multiple endpoints if desired; an event notification may be sent to as many or as few different endpoints as configured.'
