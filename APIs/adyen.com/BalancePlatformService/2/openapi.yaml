    The Configuration API enables you to create a platform where you can onboard your users as account holders and create balance accounts, cards, and business accounts.

    ## Authentication
    Your Adyen contact will provide your API credential and an API key. To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:

     ```
    curl
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
    ...
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication. For example:

    ```
    curl
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -U "ws@BalancePlatform.YOUR_BALANCE_PLATFORM":"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD" \
    ...
    ```
    ## Versioning
    The Configuration API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.

    For example:
    ```
    https://balanceplatform-api-test.adyen.com/bcl/v2/accountHolders
    ```
    ## Going live
    When going live, your Adyen contact will provide your API credential for the live environment. You can then use the API key or the username and password to send requests to `https://balanceplatform-api-live.adyen.com/bcl/v2`.

      description: Creates a [transaction rule](https://docs.adyen.com/issuing/transaction-rules). When your user makes a transaction with their Adyen-issued card, the transaction is allowed or declined based on the conditions and outcome defined in the transaction rule. You can apply the transaction rule to several cards, such as all the cards in your platform, or to a specific card. For use cases, see [examples](https://docs.adyen.com/issuing/transaction-rules/examples).
