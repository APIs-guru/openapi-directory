    Adyen Checkout API provides a simple and flexible way to initiate and authorise online payments. You can use the same integration for payments made with cards (including One-Click and 3D Secure), mobile wallets, and local payment methods (e.g. iDEAL and Sofort).

    This API reference provides information on available endpoints and how to interact with them. To learn more about the API, visit [Checkout documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/checkout).

    ## Authentication
    Each request to the Checkout API must be signed with an API key. For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:

    ```
    curl
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-API-Key: Your_Checkout_API_key" \
    ...
    ```
    Note that when going live, you need to generate a new API Key to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/development-resources/live-endpoints).

    ## Versioning
    Checkout API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.

    For example:
    ```
    https://checkout-test.adyen.com/v41/payments
    ```

  /paymentMethods:
    post:
      description: |-
        Queries the available payment methods for a transaction based on the transaction context (like amount, country, and currency). Besides giving back a list of the available payment methods, the response also returns which input details you need to collect from the shopper (to be submitted to `/payments`).

        Although we highly recommend using this endpoint to ensure you are always offering the most up-to-date list of payment methods, its usage is optional. You can, for example, also cache the `/paymentMethods` response and update it once a week.

        Submits details for a payment created using `/payments`. This step is only needed when no final state has been reached on the `/payments` request (for example for 3D Secure, or when getting redirected back directly from a payment method using an app switch).

        The exact details, which need to be sent to this endpoint, are always specified in the response of the associated `/payments` request.

        In addition, the endpoint can be used to verify a `payload`, which is returned after coming back from the Checkout SDK or any of the redirect based methods on the Checkout API.
