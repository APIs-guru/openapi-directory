    Adyen Checkout API provides a simple and flexible way to initiate
    and authorise online payments. You can use the same integration for payments
    made with cards (including 3D Secure), mobile wallets, and local payment
    methods (for example, iDEAL and Sofort).


    This API reference provides information on available endpoints and how to interact with them. To learn more about the API, visit [Checkout documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments).


    ## Authentication

    Each request to the Checkout API must be signed with an API key. For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:


    ```

    curl

    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

    -H "X-API-Key: Your_Checkout_API_key" \

    ...

    ```

    Note that when going live, you need to generate a new API Key to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).


    ## Versioning

    Checkout API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.


    For example:

    ```

    https://checkout-test.adyen.com/v65/payments

    ```

        Queries the available payment methods for a transaction based on
        the transaction context (like amount, country, and currency). Besides
        giving back a list of the available payment methods, the response also
        returns which input details you need to collect from the shopper (to be
        submitted to `/payments`).


        Although we highly recommend using this endpoint to ensure you are always offering the most up-to-date list of payment methods, its usage is optional. You can, for example, also cache the `/paymentMethods` response and update it once a week.

            If you submit a name with non-Latin characters, we automatically replace some of them with corresponding Latin characters to meet the FATF recommendations. For example:

            * χ12 is converted to ch12.

            * üA is converted to euA.

            * Peter Møller is converted to Peter Mller, because banks don't accept 'ø'.

            After replacement, the ownerName must have at least three alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), and at least one of them must be a valid Latin character (A-Z, a-z). For example:

            * John17 - allowed.

            * J17 - allowed.

            * 171 - not allowed.

            * John-7 - allowed.

            > If you use this parameter, you override the checks from Adyen's Authentication Engine. We recommend to use this field only if you have an extensive knowledge of 3D Secure.


            Possible values:

            * **1.0.2**: Apply 3D Secure version 1.0.2. 

            * **2.1.0**: Apply 3D Secure version 2.1.0. 

            * **2.2.0**: Apply 3D Secure version 2.2.0. If the issuer does not support version 2.2.0, we will fall back to 2.1.0.


            The following rules apply:

            * If you prefer 2.1.0 or 2.2.0 but we receive a negative `transStatus` in the `ARes`, we will apply the fallback policy configured in your account. For example, if the configuration is to fall back to 3D Secure 1, we will apply version 1.0.2.

            * If you prefer 2.1.0 or 2.2.0 but the BIN is not enrolled, you will receive an error.

            This is a transient, retriable error since no messaging could be initiated to an issuing system (or third-party acquiring system). Therefore, the header Transient-Error: true is returned in the response. A subsequent request using the same idempotency key will be processed as if it was the first request.

            * **IOEXCEPTION_RECEIVED** – Something went wrong during transmission of the message or receiving the response.

            This is a classified as non-transient because the message could have been received by the issuing party and been acted upon. No transient error header is returned. If using idempotency, the (error) response is stored as the final result for the idempotency key. Subsequent messages with the same idempotency key not be processed beyond returning the stored response.

            * χ12 is converted to ch12.

            * üA is converted to euA.

            * Peter Møller is converted to Peter Mller, because banks don't accept 'ø'.

            After replacement, the ownerName must have at least three alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), and at least one of them must be a valid Latin character (A-Z, a-z). For example:

            * John17 - allowed.
