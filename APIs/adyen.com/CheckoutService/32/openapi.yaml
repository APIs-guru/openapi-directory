            * χ12 is converted to ch12.

            * üA is converted to euA.

            * Peter Møller is converted to Peter Mller, because banks don't accept 'ø'.

            After replacement, the ownerName must have at least three alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), and at least one of them must be a valid Latin character (A-Z, a-z). For example:

            * John17 - allowed.
