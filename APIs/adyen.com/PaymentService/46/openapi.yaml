    A set of API endpoints that allow you to initiate, settle, and modify payments on the Adyen payments platform. You can use the API to accept card payments (including One-Click and 3D Secure), bank transfers, ewallets, and many other payment methods.

    To learn more about the API, visit [Classic integration](https://docs.adyen.com/classic-integration).

    ## Authentication
    To connect to the Payments API, you must use your basic authentication credentials. For this, create your web service user, as described in [How to get the WS user password](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-web-service-ws-user-password). Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:

    ```
    curl
    -U "ws@Company.YourCompany":"YourWsPassword" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    ...
    ```
    Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).

    ## Versioning
    Payments API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.

    For example:
    ```
    https://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Payment/v46/authorise
    ```

        Captures the authorisation hold on a payment, returning a unique reference for this request. Usually the full authorisation amount is captured, however it's also possible to capture a smaller amount, which results in cancelling the remaining authorisation balance.

        Payment methods, which automatically capture as part of authorisation, don't need to be captured, but submitting a capture request on these transactions will not result in double charges. If immediate or delayed auto-capture is enabled, calling the capture method is not neccessary.
