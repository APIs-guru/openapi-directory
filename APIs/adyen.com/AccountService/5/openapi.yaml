    The Account API provides endpoints for managing account-related entities on your platform. These related entities include account holders, accounts, bank accounts, shareholders, and KYC-related documents. The management operations include actions such as creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of them.


    For more information, refer to our [documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/platforms).

    ## Authentication

    To connect to the Account API, you must use basic authentication credentials of your web service user. If you don't have one, please contact the [Adyen Support Team](https://support.adyen.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:


    ```

    curl

    -U "ws@MarketPlace.YourMarketPlace":"YourWsPassword" \

    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

    ...

    ```

    Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).


    ## Versioning

    The Account API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.


    For example:

    ```

    https://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Account/v5/createAccountHolder

    ```

        This endpoint is used to update the `accountHolderDetails` or `processingTier` of an account holder.


        If updating the `accountHolderDetails`, only the details which have been provided will be updated. Other details will be left as-is with the exception of the following fields:

        * `accountHolderDetails.address`

        * `accountHolderDetails.fullPhoneNumber`

        * `accountHolderDetails.bankAccountDetails.BankAccountDetail`

        * `accountHolderDetails.businessDetails.shareholders.ShareholderContact`, which requires all fields necessary for validation (i.e. in order to update only the `accountHolderDetails.address.postalCode`, the fields `accountHolderDetails.address.country`, `.city`, `.street`, `.postalCode`, and possibly `.stateOrProvince` must be provided as well, so that the address can be properly validated).


        Note that this endpoint can also be used to create new bank accounts. For this, provide details of a bank account without providing a `bankAccountUUID`.


        Similarly, it can also be used to create new shareholders by providing details of a shareholder without providing a `shareholderCode`.

        > The updating of the `metadata` field will overwite all of the existing account holder metadata. In order to update an existing metadata key-value pair, all otherkey-value pairs should be provided in order to not delete them.
