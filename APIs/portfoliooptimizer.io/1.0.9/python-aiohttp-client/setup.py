    Portfolio Optimizer is a [Web API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API) to analyze and optimize investment portfolios (collection of financial assets such as stocks, bonds, ETFs, crypto-currencies) using modern portfolio theory algorithms (mean-variance, VaR, etc.).  # API General Information    Portfolio Optimizer is based on [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) for easy integration, uses [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) for the exchange of data and uses a standard [HTTP verb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods) (&#x60;POST&#x60;) to represent the action(s).  Portfolio Optimizer is also as secured as a Web API could be:  * [256-bit HTTPS Encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) * No usage of cookies * No usage of personal data    ## API Headers  The following HTTP header(s) are required when calling Portfolio Optimizer endpoints: * &#x60;Content-type: application/json&#x60;     This header specifies that the data provided in input to the endpoint is in JSON format  The following HTTP header(s) are optional when calling Portfolio Optimizer endpoints: * &#x60;Content-Encoding: gzip&#x60;     This header indicates that the data provided in input to the endpoint is compressed with gzip. * &#x60;X-API-Key: &lt;private API key&gt;&#x60;     This header enables [authenticated users](#auth) to provide their private [API key](#overview--api-key) in order to [benefit from higher API limits](#overview--api-limits)  ## API Key Portfolio Optimizer is free to use, but not free to run.  In order to obtain an API key and benefit from [higher API limits](#overview--api-limits), a *small* participation to Portfolio Optimizer running costs is required.  This participation takes the form of coffee(s), with one coffee &#x3D; one month of usage.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/portfolioopt\&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt&#x3D;&#39;Buy a Coffee at buymeacoffee.com&#39; src&#x3D;\&quot;https://img.buymeacoffee.com/button-api/?text&#x3D;Buymeacoffee.com&amp;emoji&#x3D;&amp;slug&#x3D;portfolioopt&amp;button_colour&#x3D;000000&amp;font_colour&#x3D;ffffff&amp;font_family&#x3D;Cookie&amp;outline_colour&#x3D;ffffff&amp;coffee_colour&#x3D;FFDD00\&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &gt; **Notes:**  &gt; * Please make sure not to expose your API key publicly!  ## API Limits   Portfolio Optimizer comes with *fairly reasonable* API limits.
