    Portfolio Optimizer is a [Web API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API) to optimize the composition of investment portfolios (collection of financial assets such as stocks, bonds, ETFs, crypto-currencies) using modern portfolio theory-like algorithms (mean-variance, etc.).

    # API General Information

    Portfolio Optimizer is based on [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) for easy integration, uses [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) for the exchange of data and uses the two most common [HTTP verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods) (`GET`, `POST`) to represent the actions.

    Portfolio Optimizer is also as secured as a Web API could be: 
    * [256-bit HTTPS Encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS)
    * No usage of cookies
    * No usage of personal data  

    ## API Headers 
    The following HTTP header(s) are required when calling Portfolio Optimizer endpoints:
    * `Content-type: application/json`  
      This header specifies that the data provided in input to the endpoint is in JSON format

    The following HTTP header(s) are optional when calling Portfolio Optimizer endpoints:
    * `X-API-Key: <private API key>`  
      This header enables [authenticated users](#auth) to provide their private [API key](#overview--api-key) in order to [benefit from higher API limits](#overview--api-limits)

    ## API Key
    Portfolio Optimizer is free to use, but not free to run.

    In order to obtain an API key and benefit from [higher API limits](#overview--api-limits), a *small* participation to Portfolio Optimizer running costs is required.

    This participation takes the form of coffee(s), with one coffee = one month of usage.

    > **Notes:** 
    > * Please make sure not to expose your API key publicly!

    ## API Limits 

    Portfolio Optimizer comes with *fairly reasonable* API limits.

    For anonymous users:  
    * The API requests are restricted to a subset of all the available endpoints and/or endpoints features  
    * The API requests are limited to 1 request per second for all the anonymous users combined, with concurrent requests rejected 
    * The API requests are limited to 1 second of execution time
    * The API requests are limited to 20 assets, 100 portfolios, 500 series data points

    For authenticated users with an [API key](#overview--api-key):  
    * The API requests have access to all the available endpoints and endpoints features
    * The API requests are limited to 10000 requests per 24 hour per API key, with concurrent requests queued
    * The API requests are limited to 2.5 seconds of execution time
    * The API requests are limited to 100 assets, 500 portfolios, 2500 series data points

    > **Notes:** 
    > * It is possible to further relax the API limits, or to disable the API limits alltogether; please [contact the support](https://portfoliooptimizer.io/contact/) for more details.
    > * Information on the API rate limits are provided in response messages HTTP headers `x-ratelimit-*`:  
    >   * `x-ratelimit-limit-second`, the limit on the number of API requests per second
    >   * `x-ratelimit-remaining-second`, the number of remaining API requests in the current second    
    >   * `x-ratelimit-limit-minute`, the limit on the number of API requests per minute
    >   * ...

    ## API Regions
    Portfolio Optimizer servers are located in Western Europe.

    > **Notes:** 
    > * It is possible to deploy Portfolio Optimizer in other geographical regions, for example to improve the API latency; please [contact the support](https://portfoliooptimizer.io/contact/) for more details. 

    ## API Response Codes       

    Standard [HTTP response codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) are used by Portfolio Optimizer to provide details on the status of API requests.

    | HTTP Code | Description | Notes |
    | --------- | ----------- | ----- |
    | 200 | Request successfully processed | - |
    | 400 | Request failed to be processed because of incorrect content | The response message body contains information on the incorrect content |
    | 401 | Request failed to be processed because of invalid API key | - |
    | 404 | Request failed to be processed because of non existing endpoint | The requested endpoint might exist, but needs to be accessed with another HTTP method (e.g., `POST` instead of `GET`) |
    | 429 | Request failed to be processed because of API limits violated | The response message HTTP headers `x-ratelimit-*` contain information on the [API limits](#overview--api-limits) |
    | 500 | Request failed to be processed because of an internal error | Something went wrong on Portfolio Optimizer side, do not hesitate to [report the issue](#overview--support) |
    | 502 | Request failed to be processed because of a temporary connectivity error | Something went wrong on Portfolio Optimizer side, please check the [API status](#overview--api-status) and do not hesitate to [report the issue](#overview--support) |

    ## API Status  

    Portfolio Optimizer is monitored 24/7 by [UptimeRobot](https://stats.uptimerobot.com/wgW71SL1AW).

        Compute the sample volatility (i.e., sample standard deviation) of one or several asset(s) from the asset(s) returns.

        > This endpoint is similar to the endpoint [`/assets/volatility`](#post-/assets/volatility), but uses [Bessel's correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel%27s_correction) to compute the volatility.

        Compute the discretized mean-variance minimum variance frontier associated to a list of assets, optionally subject to:
        * Minimum and maximum weights constraints
        * Maximum group weights constraints
        * Minimum and maximum portfolio exposure constraint

        > This endpoint is similar to the endpoint [`/portfolio/analysis/mean-variance/efficient-frontier`](#post-/portfolio/analysis/mean-variance/efficient-frontier), because the mean-variance efficient frontier is the "top" portion of the mean-variance minimum variance frontier.

        Compute an investable portfolio as close as possible, in terms of assets weights, to a desired portfolio, taking into account:
        * The desired assets weights
        * The desired assets groups weights
        * The desired maximum assets groups weights
        * The prices of the assets
        * The portfolio value
        * The requirement to purchase some assets by round lots or by odd lots
        * The possibility to purchase some assets by a fractional quantity of shares
        * The requirement to purchase a minimum number of shares, or a minimum monetary value, for some assets
