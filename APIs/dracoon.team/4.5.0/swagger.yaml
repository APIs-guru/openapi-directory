        ### Functional Description:
        Authenticates user and provides an authentication token that is required for most operations.

        ### Precondition:
        Existing user that is not locked.

        ### Effects:
        User is logged in.

        ### Further Information:
        The provided token is valid for **2 hours**, every usage resets this period to 2 full hours again.  
        Logging off invalidates the token.  

        ### Important:  
        * If auth type `radius` is used, a token (request parameter) may be set, otherwise this parameter is ignored.  
        * If the token is set, `password` is optional for this auth type.

        ### Currently supported languages (with ISO 639-1 code):
        * German (de)
        * English (en)
        * Spanish (es)

        Multiple fields are supported.

        ### Filter fields:

        * **nodeId**  
            Node ID  
            OPERATOR: `eq` (Node ID equal value)  
            VALUE: `Search string`

        * **nodeName**  
            Node name (Login)

        ### Logical grouping:
        Filtering according first three fields (`login`, `lastName`, `firstName`) is intrinsically processed by the API as logical _OR_.  
        In opposite, filtering according to is processed intrinsically as logical _AND_.

        ### Example:
        * `userName:cn:searchString_1|userFirstName:cn:searchString_2|nodeId:eq:2`  
        Filter by user login containing `searchString_1` OR first name containing `searchString_2` and node ID equal 2.

        ### Sort

        ### Functional Description:
        This endpoint creates a new upload channel which is the first step in any file upload workflow.

        ### Precondition:
        User has _"create"_ permissions in the parent container (room or folder).

        ### Effects:
        A new upload channel for a file is created.

        ### Further Information:
        The upload ID is used for uploads with `X-Sds-Auth-Token` header, the upload token can be used for uploads without authentication header.

        Please provide the size of the intended upload so that the quota can be checked in advanced and no data is transferred unnecessarily.

        ### Node naming convention

        * Node (room, folder, file) names are limited to 150 characters.

        * Not allowed names:  
        `'CON', 'PRN', 'AUX', 'NUL', 'COM1', 'COM2', 'COM3', 'COM4', 'COM5', 'COM6', 'COM7', 'COM8', 'COM9', 'LPT1', 'LPT2', 'LPT3', 'LPT4', 'LPT5', 'LPT6', 'LPT7', 'LPT8', 'LPT9','.','/'`

        The provided file name might be changed in accordance with the resolution strategy:  
        * **autorename**: changes the file name and adds a number to avoid conflicts.
        * **overwrite**: deletes any old file with the same file name.
        * **fail**: returns an error; in this case, another `PUT` request with a different file name may be sent.

        Please ensure that all chunks have been transferred correctly before finishing the upload.

        ### Functional Description:  
        Receive a list of users associated with a certain customer.

        ### Precondition:
        None.

        ### Effects:
        None.

        ### Further Information:
        Authentication with `X-Sds-Service-Token` required.

        ### Filter

        Filter string syntax: `FIELD_NAME:OPERATOR:VALUE`  
        Multiple fields are supported.

        ### Filter fields:

        * **login**  
            Login name  
            OPERATOR: `cn` (User login name contains value)  
            VALUE: `Search string`

        * **firstName**  
            First name  
            OPERATOR: `cn` (User first name contains value)  
            VALUE: `Search string`

        * **lastName**  
            Last name  
            OPERATOR: `cn` (User last name contains value)  
            VALUE: `Search string`

        * **lockStatus**  
            Lock status:
            * 0 - Locked
            * 1 - Web access allowed
            * 2 - Web and mobile access allowed,  
            
            OPERATOR: `eq` (User lock status)  
            VALUE: `[0|1|2]`.

        * **effectiveRoles**  
            Filter users with _DIRECT_ or _DIRECT_ **AND** _EFFECTIVE_ roles  
            * `false`: _DIRECT_ roles  
            * `true`:  _DIRECT_ **AND** _EFFECTIVE_ roles  

            > _DIRECT_ means: e.g. user gets role **directly** granted from someone with _grant permission_ right.  
            _EFFECTIVE_ means: e.g. user gets role through **group membership**.  

            OPERATOR: `eq` (multiple values not allowed)  
            VALUE: `[true|false]` (default: `false`)


        ### Logical grouping:
        Filtering according first three fields (`login`, `lastName`, `firstName`) is intrinsically processed by the API as logical _OR_.  
        In opposite, filtering according to last three field (`lockStatus`) is processed intrinsically as logical _AND_.

        ### Example:
        * `login:cn:searchString_1|firstName:cn:searchString_2|lockStatus:eq:2`  
        Filter by `login` contains `searchString_1` or `firstName` contains `searchString_2` and user are not locked.

        ### Sort

        Sort string syntax: `FIELD_NAME:ORDER`  
        Order can be `asc` or `desc`.  
        Multiple fields are supported.

        ### Sort fields:

        * **login**: Login name
        * **firstName**: First name
        * **lastName**: Last name
        * **gender**: Gender
        * **lockStatus**: User lock status
        * **lastLoginSuccessAt**: Last successful logon date
        * **expireAt**: Expiration date

        ### Example:
        * `firstName:asc|lastLoginSuccessAt:desc`  
        Sort by `firstName` ascending and by `lastLoginSuccessAt` descending.

        ### Functional Description:  
        Retrieve a list of all nodes of type `room` and the room assignment users with permissions.

        ### Precondition:
        Right _"read audit log"_ required.

        ### Effects:
        None.

        ### Further Information:
        None.

        ### Filter

        Filter string syntax: `FIELD_NAME:OPERATOR:VALUE`  
        Multiple fields are supported.

        ### Filter fields:

        * **nodeId**  
            Node ID  
            OPERATOR: `eq` (Node ID equal value)  
            VALUE: `Search string`

        * **nodeName**  
            Node name (Login)  
            OPERATOR: `cn|eq` (Node name contains value | equal value)  
            VALUE: `Search string`

        * **nodeParentId**  
            Node parent ID  
            OPERATOR: `eq` (Parent ID equal value; parent ID 0 is the root node.)  
            VALUE: `Search string`

        * **userId**  
            User ID  
            OPERATOR: `eq` (User ID equal value)  
            VALUE: `Search string`

        * **userName**  
            User name (Login)  
            OPERATOR: `cn|eq` (User name contains value | equal value)  
            VALUE: `Search string`

        * **userFirstName**  
            User first name  
            OPERATOR: `cn|eq` (User first name contains value | equal value)  
            VALUE: `Search string`

        * **userLastName**  
            User last name  
            OPERATOR: `cn|eq` (User last name contains value | equal value)  
            VALUE: `Search string`

        * **permissionsManage**  
            Filter the users that (don't) have manage right in this room  
            OPERATOR: `eq` (multiple values not allowed)  
            VALUE: `[true|false]`

        * **nodeIsEncrypted**  
            Encrypted node filter  
            OPERATOR: `eq` (multiple values not allowed)  
            VALUE: `[true|false]`

        * **nodeHasRecycleBin**  
            Recycle bin filter

        * **nodeHasActivitiesLog**  
            Activities log filter  
            OPERATOR: `eq` (multiple values not allowed)  
            VALUE: `[true|false]`

        ### Logical grouping:
        Filtering according first three fields (`login`, `lastName`, `firstName`) is intrinsically processed by the API as logical _OR_.  
        In opposite, filtering according to is processed intrinsically as logical _AND_.

        ### Example:
        * `userName:cn:searchString_1|userFirstName:cn:searchString_2|nodeId:eq:2`  
        Filter by user login containing `searchString_1` OR first name containing `searchString_2` and node ID equal 2.

        ### Sort

        Sort string syntax: `FIELD_NAME:ORDER`  
        Order can be `asc` or `desc`.  
        Multiple fields are supported.

        ### Sort fields:

        * **nodeId**: Node ID
        * **nodeName**: Node name
        * **nodeParentId**: Node parent ID
        * **nodeSize**: Node size
        * **nodeQuota**: Node quota

        ### Example:
        * `nodeName:asc`  
        Sort by `nodeName` ascending.

        ### Functional Description:  
        Get users entry point.  
        Returns a list of DRACOON users.

        ### Precondition:
        Right _"read users"_ required.

        ### Effects:
        None.

        ### Further Information:  
        Authentication with `X-Sds-Auth-Token` required.

        ### Filter

        Filter string syntax: `FIELD_NAME:OPERATOR:VALUE`  
        Multiple fields are supported.

        ### Filter fields:

        * **login**  
            Login name  
            OPERATOR: `cn` (User login name contains value)  
            VALUE: `Search string`

        * **firstName**  
            First name  
            OPERATOR: `cn` (User first name contains value)  
            VALUE: `Search string`

        * **lastName**  
            Last name  
            OPERATOR: `cn` (User last name contains value)  
            VALUE: `Search string`

        * **lockStatus**  
            Lock status:
            * 0 - Locked
            * 1 - Web access allowed
            * 2 - Web and mobile access allowed  
            
            OPERATOR: `eq` (User lock status)  
            VALUE: `[0|1|2]`.

        * **effectiveRoles**  
            Filter users with _DIRECT_ or _DIRECT_ **AND** _EFFECTIVE_ roles  
            * `false`: _DIRECT_ roles  
            * `true`:  _DIRECT_ **AND** _EFFECTIVE_ roles  

            > _DIRECT_ means: e.g. user gets role **directly** granted from someone with _grant permission_ right.  
            _EFFECTIVE_ means: e.g. user gets role through **group membership**.  

            OPERATOR: `eq` (multiple values not allowed)  
            VALUE: `[true|false]` (default: `false`)

        ### Logical grouping:
        Filtering according first three fields (`login`, `lastName`, `firstName`) is intrinsically processed by the API as logical _OR_.  
        In opposite, filtering according to last three field (lockStatus) is processed intrinsically as logical _AND_.

        ### Example:
        * `login:cn:searchString_1|firstName:cn:searchString_2|lockStatus:eq:2`  
        Filter by `login` contains `searchString_1` OR `firstName` contains `searchString_2` AND user are not locked.

        ### Sort

        Sort string syntax: `FIELD_NAME:ORDER`  
        Order can be `asc` or `desc`.  
        Multiple fields are supported.

        ### Sort fields:

        * **login**: Login name
        * **firstName**: First name
        * **lastName**: Last name
        * **gender**: Gender
        * **lockStatus**: User lock status
        * **lastLoginSuccessAt**: Last successful logon date
        * **expireAt**: Expiration date

        ### Example:
        * `firstName:asc|lastLoginSuccessAt:desc`  
        Sort by `firstName` ascending AND by `lastLoginSuccessAt` descending
