If your project is larger than that, email us at [api@rawg.io](mailto:api@rawg.io) for\ncommercial terms.\n- No cloning. It would not be cool if you used our API to launch a clone of RAWG. We know it is not always easy\nto say what is a duplicate and what isn't. Drop us a line at [api@rawg.io](mailto:api@rawg.io) if you are in doubt,\nand we will talk it through.\n- You must include an API key with every request. The key can be obtained at https://rawg.io/apidocs.\nIf you don’t provide it, we may ban your requests.\n\n__[Read more](https://rawg.io/apidocs)__.\n",
