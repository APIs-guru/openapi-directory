In addition you need a Billbee API Key identifying the application you develop. To get an API key, send a mail to support@billbee.io and send us a short note about what you are building.\n\n## Authorization & security\n\nBecause you can access private data with the Billbee API, every request has to be sent over https and must\n\n* Contain a valid API Key identifying the application/developer. It has to be sent as the HTTP header X-Billbee-Api-Key\n* Contain a valid user login with billbee username and api password in form of a basic auth HTTP header\n\n## Throttling\n\nEach endpoint has a throttle of max 2 requests per second per combination of API Key and Billbee user.\n\nWhen you exceed these 2 calls, the API will return a HTTP 429 status code\n\n",
