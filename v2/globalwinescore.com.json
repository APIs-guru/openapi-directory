        "description": "\n\nThe GlobalWineScore API is designed as a RESTful API, providing several resources and methods depending on your usage plan.\n\nFor further information please refer to <a href=\"https://www.globalwinescore.com/plans\" target=\"_blank\">our plans</a>.\n\n# Authentication\nThe API uses token-based authentication.\nIn order to authenticate your requests, you need to include a specific header in each of your requests:\n\n```\nAuthorization: Token {YOUR-API-TOKEN}\n```\nThe word <b>Token</b> must be written. Your requests must also use the <b>HTTPS</b> protocol.\n\nIf you don't have a token yet, you need to apply for one [here](https://www.globalwinescore.com/api/).\n\nYour personal token can be found under the <a href=\"https://www.globalwinescore.com/account/api/\" target=\"_blank\">My account > API</a> section of the GlobalWineScore website\n\n# Format\nThe API provides several rendering formats which you can control using the `Accept` header or `format` query parameter.\n\n- JSON (default): no header or `Accept: application/json`\n- XML: `Accept: application/xml`\n# Rate limiting\nFor API requests, the rate limit allows for up to 10 requests per minute.\n\n# Error handling\n\nWhether a request succeeded is indicated by the HTTP status code. A 2xx status code indicates success, whereas a 4xx status code indicates failure.\n\nWhen a request fails, the response body is still JSON, but always contains a `detail` field with a description of the error, which you can inspect for debugging.\n\nFor example, trying to access the API without proper authentication will return code 403 along with the message:\n\n`{\"detail\": \"Authentication credentials were not provided.\"}`\n\nFound a bug ? send us an email at <a href=\"mailto:api@globalwinescore.com\">api@globalwinescore.com</a>\n\n# Ordering\n\nAt the moment, GlobalWineScores may be sorted by `date` and `score`. Use \"-\"\nto sort in descending order.\n\n# Continuous synchronization\n\nIf you need to synchronize your database with our API, you can query our API using `?ordering=-date` to get the newest scores first, which means you won't have to crawl the whole catalog every time :-)\n\n# Quick search interface\nIf you need to search our catalog (e.g. to align it with yours), we're providing you with a handy interface accessible here: <a href=\"https://api.globalwinescore.com/search/\" target=\"_blank\">https://api.globalwinescore.com/search/</a>\n\nYou need to be logged in (email/password) to access this page, but other than that you can share it with anyone in your team and start searching right away !\n\n# Resources\n\nThe details about available endpoints can be found below.\nYou can click on each endpoint to find information about their parameters.\n",
