If you experience an issue with our api and need\nto contact technical support, please supply the value of the `X-Http-Request-Id`\nheader along with an approximate time of when the request was made.\n\n## Request Limits\n\nWhen you’re onboarded to Climate’s API platform, your `x-api-key` is assigned a custom usage plan. Usage plans are unique to each partner and have the following key attributes: \n\n1. Throttling information\n    * burstLimit: Maximum rate limit over a period ranging from 1 second to a few seconds\n    * rateLimit: A steady-state rate limit\n\n2. Quota information\n    * Limit: The maximum number of requests that can be made in a given month\n\nWhen the request rate threshold is exceeded, a `429` response code is returned. Optionally, the [`Retry-After`](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.37) header may be returned: \n\nFollowing are examples of rate limit errors:\n\n1. Rate limit exceeded:\n\n<br>HTTP/1.1 429 \n<br>Content-Type: application/json\n<br>Content-Length: 32\n\n   {\"message\":\"Too Many Requests\"}\n\n2. Quota exhausted:\n<br>HTTP/1.1 429 \n<br>Content-Type: application/json\n<br>Content-Length: 29\n\n    {\"message\":\"Limit Exceeded\"}\n\n## Pagination\n\nPagination is performed via headers. Any request which returns a `\"results\"`\narray may be paginated. The following figure shows how query results are laid out with\nX-Limit=4 and no filter applied.\n\n<img style=\"width:70%;height:auto;\" src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/climate-com/images/svg_upload_tests/paging.png\">\n\n* If there are no results, a response code of `304` will be returned.\n\n* If the response is the last set of results, a response code of `200` or\n`206` will be returned.\n\n* If there are more results, a response code of `206` will be returned.\n\n* If `X-Next-Token` is provided in the request headers but the token has\nexpired, a response code of `409` will be returned. This is only applicable\nfor some endpoints; see specific endpoint documentation below.\n\n#### X-Limit\n\nThe page size can be controlled with the `X-Limit` header. Valid values are\n`1-100` and defaults to `100`.\n\n#### X-Next-Token\n\nIf the results are paginated, a response header of `X-Next-Token` will be\nreturned. Use the associated value in the subsequent request (via the `X-Next-Token`\nrequest header) to retrieve the next page. The following sequence diagram shows how to\nuse `X-Next-Token` to fetch all the records.\n\n<img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/climate-com/images/svg_upload_tests/x-next-token.svg\">\n\n\n## Chunked Uploads\n\nUploads larger than `5MiB` (`5242880 bytes`) must be done in `5MiB` chunks\n(with the exception of the final chunk). Each chunk request MUST contain a\n`Content-Range` header specifying the portion of the upload, and a `Content-Type`\nheader specifying binary content type (`application/octet-stream`). Range\nuploads must be contiguous. The maximum upload size is capped at `500MiB` (`524288000 bytes`).\n\n## Chunked Downloads\n\nDownloads larger than `5MiB` (`5242880 bytes`) must be done in `1-5MiB`\nchunks (with the exception of the final chunk, which may be less than `1MiB`).\nEach chunk request MUST contain a `Range` header specifying the requested portion of the download,\nand an `Accept` header specifying binary and json content types  (`application/octet-stream,application/json`)\nor all content types (`*/*`).\n\n## Drivers\n\nIf you need drivers to process agronomic data, download the ADAPT plugin below. We only support the plugin in the Windows environment, minimum is Windows 7 SP1.\n\nFor asPlanted, asHarvested and asApplied data:\n* [ADAPT Plugin](https://dev.fieldview.com/drivers/ClimateADAPTPlugin_latest.exe)\n<br>Release notes can be found [here](https://dev.fieldview.com/drivers/adapt-release-notes.txt).\n<br>Download and use of the ADAPT plugin means that you agree to the EULA for use of the ADAPT plugin. \n<br>Please review the [EULA](https://dev.fieldview.com/EULA/ADAPT%20Plugin%20EULA-06-19.pdf) (last updated on June 6th, 2019) before download and use of the ADAPT plugin.\n<br>For more information, please refer to:\n  * [ADAPT Resources](https://adaptframework.org/)\n  * [ADAPT Overview](https://aggateway.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ADM/overview)\n  * [ADAPT FAQ](https://aggateway.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ADM/pages/165942474/ADAPT+Frequently-Asked+Questions+FAQ)\n  * [ADAPT Videos](https://adaptframework.org/adapt-videos/)\n\n## Sample Test Data\n\nSample agronomic data:\n* [asPlanted and asHarvested data](https://dev.fieldview.com/sample-agronomic-data/Planting_Harvesting_data_04_18_2018_21_46_18.zip)\n* [asApplied data set 1](https://dev.fieldview.com/sample-agronomic-data/as-applied-data1.zip)\n* [asApplied data set 2](https://dev.fieldview.com/sample-agronomic-data/as-applied-data2.zip)\n<br>To upload the sample data to your account, please follow the instructions in this [link](https://support.climate.com/kt#/kA02A000000AaxzSAC/en_US).\n\nSample soil data:\n* [Sample soil data](https://dev.fieldview.com/sample-soil-data/soil-sample.xml)\n---\n",
