        "description": "# Budgea Development Guides\n\nWelcome to **Budgea**'s documentation.\n\nThis documentation is intended to get you up-and-running with our APIs and advise on the implementation of some regulatory aspects of your application, following the DSP2's guidelines.\n\n## Getting Started\n**IMPORTANT**\nDepending on your status with regard of the DSP2 regulation, **agent** or **partner**, you may call our APIs or simply use our Webview and callbacks to get the financial data of your users.\nAs an **agent**, you are allowed to call directly our APIs and implement your own form to get the user's credentials.\nAs a **partner**, you cannot manipulate the credentials, and have to delegate this step to us through our webview.\n\nThe sections below will document how to use our APIs, make sure you have the **agent** status to do so.\nFor the **partner**, please refer to the section *Webview* and *Callbacks* of this documentation.\n\n### Overview\nYour API is a REST API which requires a communication through https to send and receive JSON documents.\nDuring your tests, we recommend to make calls to the API with curl or any other HTTP client of your choice.\nYou can watch a video demonstration on this [URL](https://asciinema.org/a/FsaFyt3WAPyDm7sfaZPkwal3V).\nFor the examples we'll use the demo API with address `https://demo.biapi.pro`, you should change that name to your API's name.\n\n### Hello World\nLet's start by calling the service `/banks` which lists all available banks.\n```\ncurl https://demo.biapi.pro/2.0/banks/\n```\nTo log in to a bank webpage, you'll need to know for a given bank, the fields your user should fill in the form.\nLet's call a  specific bank and ask for an additional resource *fields*.\n```\ncurl https://demo.biapi.pro/2.0/banks/59?expand=fields\n```\nThe response here concerns only 1 bank (since we specified an id) and the resource _Fields_ is added to the response thanks to the query parameter `expand`.\n\nTo get more interesting things done, you'll need to send authenticated requests.\n\n### Authentication\nThe way to authenticate is by passing the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header in your request.\nAt the setup a _manage token_ have been generated, you can use this token for now, when creating your user we'll see how to generate a user's token.\n```\ncurl https://demo.biapi.pro/2.0/config \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'\n```\nThis endpoint will list all the parameters you can change to adapt Budgea to your needs.\n\nWe've covered the very first calls. Before diving deeper, let's see some general information about the APIs.\n\n## Abstract\n\n### API URL\n`https://demo.biapi.pro/2.0`\n\n### Requests format\nData format: **application/x-www-form-urlencoded** or **application/json** (suggested)\n\nAdditional headers: Authorization: User's token (private)\n\n### Responses format\nData format: **application/json** ([http://www.json.org](http://www.json.org/))\nCharset: **UTF-8**\n\n### Resources\nEach call on an endpoint will return resources. The main resources are:\n| Resource            | Description                                                                                                           |\n| ---------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   |\n|Users                 |Represent a user                                                                                                      |\n|Connection            |A set of data used to authenticate on a website (usually a login and password). There is 1 connection for each website|\n|Account               |A bank account contained in a connection                                                                              |\n|Transaction           |An entry in a bank account                                                                                            |\n|Investment            |An asset in a bank account                                                                                            |\n\nThe chain of resources is as follow: **Users ∈ Connections ∈ Accounts ∈ Transactions or Investments**\n\n### RESTful API\n\nThis API is RESTful, which means it is stateless and each resource is accessed with an unique URI.\n\nSeveral HTTP methods are available:\n\n| Method                  | Description                    |\n| ------------------------|:-------------------------------|\n| GET /resources          | List resources                 |\n| GET /resources/{ID}     | Get a resource from its ID     |\n| POST /resources         | Create a new resource          |\n| POST /resources/{ID}    | Update a resource              |\n| PUT /resources  /{ID}   | Update a resource              |\n| DELETE /resources       | Remove every resources         |\n| DELETE /resources/{ID}  | Delete a resource              |\n\n\nEach resource can contain sub-resources, for example:\n`/users/me/connections/2/accounts/23/transactions/48`\n\n### HTTP response codes\n\n| Code        | Message               | Description                                                                                   |\n| ----------- |:---------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 200         | OK                    |Default response when a GET or POST request has succeed                                        |\n| 202         | Accepted              |For a new connection this code means it is necessary to provide complementary information (2FA)|\n| 204         | No content            |Default response when a POST request succeed without content                                   |\n| 400         | Bad request           |Supplied parameters are incorrect                                                              |\n| 403         | Forbidden             |Invalid token                                                                                  |\n| 500         | Internal Servor Error |Server error                                                                                   |\n| 503         | Service Unavailable   |Service is temporarily unavailable                                                             |\n\n### Errors management\nIn case an error occurs (code 4xx or 5xx), the response can contain a JSON object describing this error:\n```json\n{\n   \"code\": \"authFailure\",\n   \"message\": \"Wrong password\"  // Optional\n}\n```\nIf an error is displayed on the website, Its content is returned in error_message field.\nThe list of all possible errors is listed further down this page.\n\n### Authentication\nA user is authenticated by an access_token which is sent by the API during a call on one of the authentication services, and can be supplied with this header:\n`Authorization: Bearer YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY`\n\n There are two user levels:\n\n    - Normal user, which can only access to his own accounts\n    - Administrator, with extended rights\n\n### Default filters\nDuring a call to an URI which lists resources, some filters can be passed as query parameters:\n\n| Parameter   | Type      | Description                                               |\n| ----------- |:---------:|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| offset      | Integer   |Offset of the first returned resource                      |\n| limit       | Integer   |Limit number of results                                    |\n| min_date    | Date      |Minimal date (if supported by service), format: YYYY-MM-DD |\n| max_date    | Date      |Maximal date (if supported by service), format: YYYY-MM-DD |\n\n### Extend requests\nDuring a GET on a set of resources or on a unique resource, it is possible to add a parameter expand to the request to extend relations with other resources:\n\n`GET /2.0/users/me/accounts/123?expand=transactions[category],connection`\n\n```json\n{\n   \"id\" : 123\n   \"name\" : \"Compte chèque\"\n   \"balance\" : 1561.15\n   \"transactions\" : [\n      {\n

Now let's see how to integrate Budgea in your app and create your first user.\n\n## Integrate Budgea *(protocol or Webview)*\n### The workflow\nUsers of your application exist in the Budgea API.\nEvery User is identified by an access_token which is the shared secret between your application and our API.\n\nThe workflow is as below:\n1. The user is on your application and wants to share his bank accounts or invoices.\n2. A call is made **client side** (browser's javascript or desktop application) to create a temporarily token which will be used to make API calls.\n3. A form is built, allowing the user to select the connector to use (bank or provider, depending on context). Every connector requires different kind of credentials.\n4. A call on the API is made with the temporarily token to add a **Connection** with the credentials supplied by user.\n5. In case of success, the user chooses what bank accounts (**Account**) or subscriptions (**Subscription**) he wants to share with your application.\n6. When he validates the share, the temporarily token is transmitted to your server. This one will call the Budgea API with this token to get a permanent token.\n\n**Note**\nIn case your application works without a server (for example a desktop application), the permanent token can be obtained on the 1st step, by supplying a client_secret to /auth/init and the step 6 is omitted. To get more information, read the protocol.\n\nThere are 3 steps to integrate Budgea in your application:\n1. Provide a way for your users to share their credentials with you\n2. Get the data scraped from Budgea\n3. Be sure to follow the good practices before going into production\n\n### Get credentials from users\nYou have 2 options here:\n- Integrate the Budget Insight's Webview, a turnkey solution to get user's credentials\n- Create your own form following the protocol (must have the *agent* status)\n\n### Budgea webview\n\nThe Budgea webview complements REST API endpoints with web-based services to handle sensitive or complex operations:\n- add a connection (to a bank or a provider), or edit/repare access to a connection;\n- manage connections (add/remove/edit);\n- edit and validate bank transfers (alpha preview).\n\nUsage of the webview is mandatory if you don't hold an Agent status, since you are not allowed to use API endpoints carrying user credentials, and optional otherwise.\n\n#### Implementation guidelines\n\n##### Base URL\n\nThe base URL of all services must be customized:  \n`https://{{domain}}.biapi.pro/2.0/auth/webview/`  \n`https://{{domain}}.biapi.pro/2.0/auth/webview/{{lang}}/`  \n- `{{domain}}`: substitute with you API domain;\n- `{{lang}}`: optionally specify the language of the webview, `en` or `fr` (if not specified, an automatic redirection will be performed following the language of the browser).\n\n##### Browser integration\n\nServices available as part of the webview are designed as parameterized URLs intended to be opened in a web browser. A callback URI must be specified by callers to be notified at the end of the operation flow, similar to OAuth 2 specification.\n\nYou are encouraged to integrate web-based steps in your product following UX best practices:\n- in a web environment, perform a full-page redirect to the URL (using either [HTTP redirect](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/302) or [scripting](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/Location)), and avoid new tabs or popups;\n- in a native Android app, prefer opening the default browser or relying on [Chrome Custom Tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/customtabs) to integrating a WebView;\n- in a native iOS app, prefer using a [SFSafariViewController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller) to integrating a WKWebView.\n\n##### Callback handling\n\nMost flows redirect to a callback URI at the end of the process. Query parameters are added to the URI to identify successful or failed operations.\n\nSuccessful parameters are specific to each flow. In case of an error, the following parameters are added:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| - | - |\n| `error` | An lowercase string error code identifying the kind of error that occurred. When the parameter is not present, the response is successful. |\n| `error_description` | A longer string description of the error (not intended for user display). |\n\nCommon error codes include:\n\n| Code | Description |\n| - | - |\n| `access_denied` | The user explicitly cancelled the flow. |\n| `server_error` | Oops, a technical failure occurred during the process. |\n\n**Forward compatibility requirement**: Additional error codes may be added in the future to describe specific cases. When implementing error codes handling, always fallback to a generic case for unknown codes.\n\n##### Browser compatibility\n\nThe webview is designed and tested to work with browsers supported by the Angular framework:  \nhttps://angular.io/guide/browser-support\n\n##### Privacy / GDPR status\n\nThe webview itself does not use any kind of long-term data persistence mechanism such as cookies or local storage, but some authentication or authorization steps may delegate to third-party web services that may implement them.\n\n#### Configuration\n\nYou can configure the appearance and behaviour of the webview by configuring the associated *Client Application* in the console:\n\n| Key | Format | Description |\n| - | - | - |\n| `primary_color` | String | Optional. An accent color (hexadecimal string without '#' prefix) to personalize the UI elements of the webview. If absent, the default color is grey. |\n| `redirect_uri` | String | Optional. A recommended security whitelist configuration. The `redirect_uri` parameter sent to any endpoint of the webview is checked against the configuration, if any. |\n| `config.disable_connector_hints` | Boolean | Optional. This flags hides the list of most-used entries in the connector selection step. The default is `false`, i.e. the list is shown. |\n| `config.use_app_layout` | Boolean | Optional. Use this flag to enable presenting your log as an app icon. The default value is ` false`, i.e. the logo is shown in the top bar of the UI. |\n| `config.disable_accounts_pre_check` | Boolean | Optional. An optional boolean flag to prevent bank accounts to be automatically pre-checked when the user enters the activation step. The default value is ` false`, i.e. the bank accounts are pre-checked. |\n\n#### Endpoints reference\n\n##### Add connection flow\n```\nhttps://{{domain}}.biapi.pro/2.0/auth/webview/{{lang}}/connect\n```\n\nThis flow allows an end-user to add a new connection to the API. The flow handles the following steps:\n- selecting a connector;\n- authenticating & authorizing with the connector, by collecting credentials or delegating;\n- managing consent to aggregate accounts/subscriptions;\n- collecting required information for professional accounts.\n\n###### Endpoint parameters\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| - | - |\n| `client_id` | Required.

Identical to the `state` parameter that was initially specified. |\n\n###### Additional error codes\n\n| Code | Description |\n| - | - |\n| `tos_declined` | The end-user refused to validate the terms of service. |\n\n#### Migrating from v3\n\nWe provide a full backward compatibility layer with current implementations of the webview v3 to ease the transition. All endpoints remains accessible, with the same parameters and callback behaviour. Migration instructions are provided below.\n\n*The v3 compatibility mode is expected to be removed on 31 December 2019.* You should migrate your implementation a soon as possible to new endpoints and parameters.\n\n##### Add connection flow / Edit connection credentials  \n```\n/connect/select\n```\n\nThis endpoint has been superseded by `/connect` (no suffix) for adding a new connection, and `/reconnect` for resetting or updating an existing connection.\n\n| Endpoint parameter | Migration instructions |\n| - | - |\n| `client_id` | No change. |\n| `redirect_uri`, `state` | No change. |\n| `response_type` | This parameter is not used anymore. |\n| `id_connector`, `connectors` | Superseded by `connector_ids` sent to the `/connect` endpoint. |\n| `types` | Superseded by `connector_capabilities` sent to the `/connect` endpoint.<br>Use`connector_capabilities=bank` (bank connection) or `connector_capabilities=document` (provider connection). |\n| `id_connection` | Superseded by `connection_id` sent to the `/reconnect` endpoint. |\n\nPassing the code or access token as an URL fragment is no longer supported, use the `code` query parameter.\n\n| Callback parameter | Migration instructions |\n| - | - |\n| `id_connection` | Superseded by `connection_id`.<br>In the `/reconnect` flow, this parameter is not returned anymore. |\n| `code` | Still named `code`, but in the `/connect` flow the parameter is now **only** added if an anonymous user was created, i.e. the `code` parameter was **not** provided as a query parameter or fragment.<br>In the `/reconnect` flow, this parameter is not returned anymore. |\n| `state` | No change. |\n\n##### Manage connections\n\n```\n/accounts\n```\n\nThis endpoint has been superseded by `/manage`, that now fully allows users to add/remove connections, reset their credentials or recover from error states.\n\n| Endpoint parameter | Migration instructions |\n| - | - |\n| `client_id` | No change. |\n| `redirect_uri`, `state` | No change, these parameters are now optional. |\n| `response_type` | This parameter is not used anymore. |\n| `types` | Superseded by `connector_capabilities`.<br>Use`connector_capabilities=bank` (bank connection) or `connector_capabilities=document` (provider connection). |\n\nPassing the code or access token as an URL fragment is no longer supported, use the `code` query parameter.\n\n| Callback parameter | Migration instructions |\n| - | - |\n| `code` | This parameter is not returned anymore. |\n| `state` | No change. |\n\n##### Behaviour change\n\nIn v3, the `/accounts` flow used to redirect to the `redirect_uri` after a connection addition. This is no longer the case in v4, where redirection is only performed when the user explicitly closes the flow. If you need to perform actions when a connection is added or removed, you should rely on webhooks.\n\n#### Protocol\nThis section describes the protocol used to set bank and provider accounts of a user, in case you don't want to use the webview.\n\nThe idea is to call the following services client-side (with AJAX in case of a web application), to ensure the bank and providers credentials will not be sent to your servers.\n\n1. /auth/init\n```http\nPOST /auth/init\n```\n```json\n{\n   \"auth_token\" : \"fBqjMZbYddebUGlkR445JKPA6pCoRaGb\",\n   \"type\" : \"temporary\",\n   \"expires_in\" : 1800,\n   \"id_user\": 1\n}\n```\nThis service creates a temporarily token, to use in the \"Authorization\" header in next calls to the API\n\nThe returned token has a life-time of 30 minutes, and should be transfered to the API then (cf Permanent Token), so that your server can get a permanent access_token.\n\nIt is possible to generate a permanent token immediately, by calling the service with the manage_token, or by supply parameters client_id and client_secret.\n\n2. /banks or /providers\n```http\nGET /banks?expand=fields\nAuthorization: Bearer <token>\n```\n```json\n{\n   \"hidden\" : false,\n         \"charged\" : true,\n         \"name\" : \"American Express\",\n         \"id\" : 30,\n         \"fields\" : [\n            {\n               \"values\" : [\n                  {\n                     \"label\" : \"Particuliers/Professionnels\",\n                     \"value\" : \"pp\"\n                  },\n                  {\n                     \"value\" : \"ent\",\n                     \"label\" : \"Entreprises\"\n                  }\n               ],\n               \"label\" : \"Type de compte\",\n               \"regex\" : null,\n               \"name\" : \"website\",\n               \"type\" : \"list\"\n            },\n            {\n               \"type\" : \"password\",\n               \"label\" : \"Code secret\",\n               \"name\" : \"password\",\n               \"regex\" : \"^[0-9]{6}$\"\n            }\n         ],\n      },\n      ...\n   ],\n   \"total\" : 44,\n}\n```\nYou get a list of connectors, and all associated fields needed to build the form at step 3.\nYou can also use that list to show to your user, all available banks.\n\n3. /users/me/connections\nMake a POST request and supply the id_bank (ID of the chosen bank) or id_provider (ID of provider), and all requested fields as key/value parameters.\nFor example:\n```http\nPOST /users/me/connections\nAuthorization: Bearer <token>\n-F login=12345678\n-F password=123456\n-F id_bank=59\n```\nYou can get the following return codes:\n\n|Code           |Description                                                  |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------ |\n|200            |The connection has succeed and has been created              |\n|202            |It is necessary to provide complementary information. This occurs on the first connection on some kind of Boursorama accounts for example, where a SMS is sent to the customer. It is necessary to ask the user to fill fields requested in the fields, and do a POST again on /users/me/connections/ID, with the connection ID in id_connection. |\n|400            |Unable to connect to the website, the field error in the JSON can be **websiteUnavailable** or **wrongpass**  |\n|403            |Invalid token                                                |\n\n4. Activate accounts\nThe accounts the user wants to aggregate must be activated before any transaction or investment is retrieved.\nSeveral accounts can be activated in 1 request by separating the account ids with commas.\n```http\nPUT /users/me/connections/<id_connection>/accounts/<id_account>?all\n```\n\n5. Permanent token\nIf the user validates the share of his accounts, it is necessary to transform the temporary code to a permanent access_token (so that the user won't expire).\n\nTo do that, make a POST request on /auth/token/access with the following parameters:\n|Parameter            |Description                                                     |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n|code                 |The temporarily token which will let you get the access_token   |\n|client_id            |The ID of your client application                               |\n|client_secret        |The secret of your client application                           |\n\n```json\nPOST /auth/token/access\n\n{\n   \"client_id\" : 17473055,\n   \"client_secret\" : \"54tHJHjvodbANVzaRtcLzlHGXQiOgw80\",\n   \"code\" : \"fBqjMZbYddebUGlkR445JKPA6pCoRaGb\"\n}\n```\n```http\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\n{\n   \"access_token\" : \"7wBPuFfb1Hod82f1+KNa0AmrkIuQ3h1G\",\n   \"token_type\":\"Bearer\"\n}\n```\n\n### Update accounts\nAnother important call is when a user wants to add/remove connections to banks or providers, or to change the password on one of them, it is advised to give him a temporarily code from the permanent access_token, with the following call (using the access_token as bearer):\n```http\nPOST /auth/token/code\nAuthorization: Bearer <token>\n```\n```json\n{\n   \"code\" : \"/JiDppWgbmc+5ztHIUJtHl0ynYfw682Z\",\n   \"type\" : \"temporary\",\n   \"expires_in\" : 1800,\n}\n```\nIts life-time is 30 minutes, and let the browser to list connections and accounts, via `GET /users/me/connections?expand=accounts` for example.\n\n To update the password of a connection, you can do a POST on the *connection* resource, with the field *password* in the data. The new credentials are checked to make sure they are valid, and the return codes are the same as when adding a connection.\n\n## Getting the data (Webhooks)\nYou have created your users and their connections, now it's time to get the data.\nThere are 2 ways to retrieve it, the 2 can be complementary:\n- make regular calls to the API\n- use the webhooks (recommended)\n\n### Manual Synchronization\nIt is possible to do a manual synchronization of a user. We recommend to use this method in case the user wants fresh data after logging in.\n\nTo trigger the synchronization, call the API as below:\n`PUT /users/ID/connections`\nThe following call is blocking until the synchronization is terminated.\n\nEven if it is not recommended, it's possible to fetch synchronously new data. To do that, you can use the *expand* parameter:\n` /users/ID/connections?expand=accounts[transactions,investments[type]],subscriptions`\n```json\n{\n   \"connections\" : [\n      {\n         \"accounts\" : [\n            {\n               \"balance\" : 7481.01,\n               \"currency\" : {\n                  \"symbol\" : \"€\",\n                  \"id\" : \"EUR\",\n                  \"prefix\" : false\n               },\n               \"deleted\" : null,\n               \"display\" : true,\n               \"formatted_balance\" : \"7 481,01 €\",\n               \"iban\" : \"FR76131048379405300290000016\",\n               \"id\" : 17,\n               \"id_connection\" : 7,\n               \"investments\" : [\n                  {\n                     \"code\" : \"FR0010330902\",\n                     \"description\" : \"\",\n                     \"diff\" : -67.86,\n                     \"id\" : 55,\n                     \"id_account\" : 19,\n                     \"id_type\" : 1,\n                     \"label\" : \"Agressor PEA\",\n                     \"portfolio_share\" : 0.48,\n                     \"prev_diff\" : 2019.57,\n                     \"quantity\" : 7.338,\n                     \"type\" : {\n                        \"color\" : \"AABBCC\",\n                        \"id\" : 1,\n                        \"name\" : \"Fonds action\"\n                     },\n                     \"unitprice\" : 488.98,\n                     \"unitvalue\" : 479.73,\n                     \"valuation\" : 3520.28\n                  }\n               ],\n               \"last_update\" : \"2015-07-04 15:17:30\",\n               \"name\" : \"Compte chèque\",\n               \"number\" : \"3002900000\",\n               \"transactions\" : [\n                  {\n                     \"active\" : true,\n                     \"application_date\" : \"2015-06-17\",\n                     \"coming\" : false,\n                     \"comment\" : null,\n                     \"commission\" : null,\n                     \"country\" : null,\n                     \"date\" : \"2015-06-18\",\n                     \"date_scraped\" : \"2015-07-04 15:17:30\",\n                     \"deleted\" : null,\n                     \"documents_count\" : 0,\n                     \"formatted_value\" : \"-16,22 €\",\n                     \"id\" : 309,\n                     \"id_account\" : 17,\n                     \"id_category\" : 9998,\n                     \"id_cluster\" : null,\n                     \"last_update\" : \"2015-07-04 15:17:30\",\n                     \"new\" : true,\n                     \"original_currency\" : null,\n                     \"original_value\" : null,\n                     \"original_wording\" : \"FACTURE CB HALL'S BEER\",\n                     \"rdate\" : \"2015-06-17\",\n                     \"simplified_wording\" : \"HALL'S BEER\",\n                     \"state\" : \"parsed\",\n                     \"stemmed_wording\" : \"HALL'S BEER\",\n                     \"type\" : \"card\",\n                     \"value\" : -16.22,\n                     \"wording\" : \"HALL'S BEER\"\n                  }\n               ],\n               \"type\" : \"checking\"\n            }\n         ],\n         \"error\" : null,\n         \"expire\" : null,\n         \"id\" : 7,\n         \"id_user\" : 7,\n         \"id_bank\" : 41,\n         \"last_update\" : \"2015-07-04 15:17:31\"\n      }\n   ],\n   \"total\" : 1,\n}\n```\n\n### Background synchronizations & Webhooks\nWebhooks are callbacks sent to your server, when an event is triggered during a synchronization.\nSynchronizations are automatic, the frequency can be set using the configuration key `autosync.frequency`.\nUsing webhooks allows you to get the most up-to-date data of your users, after each synchronization.\n\nThe automatic synchronization makes it possible to recover new bank entries, or new invoices, at a given frequency.\nYou have the possibility to add webhooks on several events, and choose to receive each one on a distinct URL.\nTo see the list of available webhooks you can call the endpoint hereunder:\n```\ncurl https://demo.biapi.pro/2.0/webhooks_events \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'\n```\n\nThe background synchronizations for each user are independent, and their plannings are spread over the day so that they do not overload any website.\n\nOnce the synchronization of a user is over, a POST request is sent on the callback URL you have defined, including all webhook data.\nA typical json sent to your server is as below:\n```http\nPOST /callback HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.org\nContent-Length: 959\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, compress\nAccept: */*\nUser-Agent: Budgea API/2.0\nContent-Type: application/json;

If this is not the case, you can contact us to add your CA (Certificate Authority) to our PKI (Public Key Infrastructure).\n\nImportant: it is necessary to send back a HTTP 200 code, without what we consider that data is not correctly taken into account on your system, and it will be sent again at the next user synchronization.\n\n## Guidelines for production\nNow you should have integrated the API inside your application. Make sure your Webhooks URLs are in HTTPS, if so you can enable the production state of the API.\n\nTo make things great, here are some good practices, please check you have respected them:\n- You have provided to your users a way to configure their accounts\n- You have provided to your users a way to change their account passwords\n- You consider the **error** field of Connections, to alert the user in case the state is **wrongpass**\n- You map IDs of Accounts, Subscriptions, Transactions and Documents in your application, to be sure to correctly match them\n- When the deleted field is set on a bank transaction, you delete it in your database\n- You don't loop on all users to launch synchronizations, this might saturate the service\n\nIf you have questions about above points, please contact us. Otherwise, you can put into production!\n\n### Going further\nIf you want to raise the bar for your app and add features such as the ability to do transfers, get invoices, aggregate patrimony and more, please refer to the sections below.\nWe'll discuss complementary APIs building upon the aggregation, allowing for the best of financial apps.\n\n## Budgea API Pay\nThis API allows for the emition of transfers between the aggregated accounts.\nJust like the simple aggregation, BI provides a webview or a protocol to follow, to implement this feature.\n\n### API pay protocol\nThis section describes how the transfer and recipient protocol work, in case you don't want to integrate the webview.\nThe idea is to do following calls client side (with AJAX in case of a web application), so that the interaction with the Budgea API is transparent.\n\n#### Executing a transfer\n1. /auth/token/code\nIf you do calls client side, get a new temporary code for the user, from the access_token.
