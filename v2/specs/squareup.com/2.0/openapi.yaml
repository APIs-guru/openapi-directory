        account. Employees created with the Connect API have an initial status
        of `INACTIVE`. Inactive employees cannot sign in to Square Point of Sale

        cannot be changed with the Connect API.

        Employee entities cannot be deleted. To disable employee profiles,

        Creates an employee role you can then assign to employees.

        Square accounts can include any number of roles that can be assigned to
        employees. These roles define the actions and permissions granted to an
        employee with that role. For example, an employee with a "Shift Manager"
        role might be able to issue refunds in Square Point of Sale, whereas an
        employee with a "Clerk" role might not.

        Roles are assigned with the [V1UpdateEmployee](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-08-18/v1-employees-api/update-employee-role)
        endpoint. An employee can have only one role at a time.

        If an employee has no role, they have none of the permissions associated
        with roles. All employees can accept payments with Square Point of Sale.

        The returned `Settlement` objects include an `entries` field that lists
        the transactions that contribute to the settlement total. Most
        settlement entries correspond to a payment payout, but settlement
        entries are also generated for less common events, like refunds, manual
        adjustments, or chargeback holds.

        Square initiates its regular deposits as indicated in the
        [Deposit Options with Square](https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/3807)
        help article. Details for a regular deposit are usually not available
        from Connect API endpoints before 10 p.m. PST the same day.

        Square does not know when an initiated settlement **completes**, only
        whether it has failed. A completed settlement is typically reflected in
        a bank account within 3 business days, but in exceptional cases it may
        take longer.

        Creates a new `BreakType`.

        A `BreakType` is a template for creating `Break` objects.
        You must provide the following values in your request to this
        endpoint:

        - `location_id`
        - `break_name`
        - `expected_duration`
        - `is_paid`

        You can only have three `BreakType` instances per location. If you attempt to add a fourth
        `BreakType` for a location, an `INVALID_REQUEST_ERROR` "Exceeded limit of 3 breaks per location."
        is returned.

        - The `status` of the new `Shift` is `OPEN` and the employee has another
        shift with an `OPEN` status.
        - The `start_at` date is in the future.
        - The `start_at` or `end_at` date overlaps another shift for the same employee.
        - The `Break` instances are set in the request and a break `start_at`
        is before the `Shift.start_at`, a break `end_at` is after
        the `Shift.end_at`, or both.

        Redeems a loyalty reward.

        The endpoint sets the reward to the `REDEEMED` terminal state. 

        If you are using your own order processing system (not using the 
        Orders API), you call this endpoint after the buyer paid for the

        After the reward reaches the terminal state, it cannot be deleted. 
        In other words, points used for the reward cannot be returned 
        to the account.

        Use this method when the status of a `CreatePayment` request is unknown (for example, after you send a
        `CreatePayment` request, a network error occurs and you do not get a response). In this case, you can
        direct Square to cancel the payment using this endpoint. In the request, you provide the same
        idempotency key that you provided in your `CreatePayment` request that you want to cancel. After
        canceling the payment, you can submit your `CreatePayment` request again.

        Note that if no payment with the specified idempotency key is found, no action is taken and the endpoint
        returns successfully.

        Searches for subscriptions.
        Results are ordered chronologically by subscription creation date. If
        the request specifies more than one location ID,
        the endpoint orders the result
        by location ID, and then by creation date within each location. If no locations are given
        in the query, all locations are searched.

        You can also optionally specify `customer_ids` to search by customer.
        If left unset, all customers
        associated with the specified locations are returned.
        If the request specifies customer IDs, the endpoint orders results
        first by location, within location by customer ID, and within
        customer by subscription creation date.

    Address:
      description: |-
        Represents a postal address in a country. The address format is based 
        on an [open-source library from Google](https://github.com/google/libaddressinput). For more information, 
        see [AddressValidationMetadata](https://github.com/google/libaddressinput/wiki/AddressValidationMetadata). 
        This format has dedicated fields for four address components: postal code, 
        locality (city), administrative district (state, prefecture, or province), and 
        sublocality (town or village). These components have dedicated fields in the 
        `Address` object because software sometimes behaves differently based on them. 
        For example, sales tax software may charge different amounts of sales tax 
        based on the postal code, and some software is only available in 
        certain states due to compliance reasons.

        For the remaining address components, the `Address` type provides the 
        `address_line_1` and `address_line_2` fields for free-form data entry. 
        These fields are free-form because the remaining address components have 
        too many variations around the world and typical software does not parse 
        these components. These fields enable users to enter anything they want. 

        Note that, in the current implementation, all other `Address` type fields are blank. 
        These include `address_line_3`, `sublocality_2`, `sublocality_3`, 
        `administrative_district_level_2`, `administrative_district_level_3`, 
        `first_name`, `last_name`, and `organization`. 

        When it comes to localization, the seller's language preferences 
        (see [Language preferences](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/locations-api#location-specific-and-seller-level-language-preferences)) 
        are ignored for addresses. Even though Square products (such as Square Point of Sale 
        and the Seller Dashboard) mostly use a seller's language preference in 
        communication, when it comes to addresses, they will use English for a US address, 
        Japanese for an address in Japan, and so on.

            provide less specific details like city, state/province, or country (these

          description: |-
            A batch of CatalogObjects to be inserted/updated atomically.
            The objects within a batch will be inserted in an all-or-nothing fashion, i.e., if an error occurs
            attempting to insert or update an object within a batch, the entire batch will be rejected. However, an error
            in one batch will not affect other batches within the same request.

            For each object, its `updated_at` field is ignored and replaced with a current [timestamp](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-dates), and its
            `is_deleted` field must not be set to `true`.

            To modify an existing object, supply its ID. To create a new object, use an ID starting
            with `#`. These IDs may be used to create relationships between an object and attributes of
            other objects that reference it. For example, you can create a CatalogItem with
            ID `#ABC` and a CatalogItemVariation with its `item_id` attribute set to
            `#ABC` in order to associate the CatalogItemVariation with its parent
            CatalogItem.

            Any `#`-prefixed IDs are valid only within a single atomic batch, and will be replaced by server-generated IDs.

            Each batch may contain up to 1,000 objects. The total number of objects across all batches for a single request
            may not exceed 10,000. If either of these limits is violated, an error will be returned and no objects will
            be inserted or updated.

            A value you specify that uniquely identifies this

            a valid idempotency key is to use a Universally unique
            identifier (UUID).

            If you're unsure whether a particular request was successful,
            you can reattempt it with the same idempotency key without
            worrying about creating duplicate objects.

        The wrapper object for the Catalog entries of a given object type.

        The type of a particular `CatalogObject` is determined by the value of the
        `type` attribute and only the corresponding data attribute can be set on the `CatalogObject` instance.
        For example, the following list shows some instances of `CatalogObject` of a given `type` and
        their corresponding data attribute that can be set:
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `ITEM` type, set the `item_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogItem` object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `ITEM_VARIATION` type, set the `item_variation_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogItemVariation` object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `MODIFIER` type, set the `modifier_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogModifier` object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `MODIFIER_LIST` type, set the `modifier_list_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogModifierList` object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `CATEGORY` type, set the `category_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogCategory` object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `DISCOUNT` type, set the `discount_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogDiscount` object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `TAX` type, set the `tax_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogTax` object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `IMAGE` type, set the `image_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogImageData`  object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `QUICK_AMOUNTS_SETTINGS` type, set the `quick_amounts_settings_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogQuickAmountsSettings` object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `PRICING_RULE` type, set the `pricing_rule_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogPricingRule` object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `TIME_PERIOD` type, set the `time_period_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogTimePeriod` object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `PRODUCT_SET` type, set the `product_set_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogProductSet`  object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN` type, set the `subscription_plan_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogSubscriptionPlan` object.

            A map (key-value pairs) of application-defined custom attribute values. The value of a key-value pair
            is a [CatalogCustomAttributeValue](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-08-18/objects/CatalogCustomAttributeValue) object. The key is the `key` attribute
            value defined in the associated [CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-08-18/objects/CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition)
            object defined by the application making the request.

            If the `CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition` object is
            defined by another application, the `CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition`'s key attribute value is prefixed by
            the defining application ID. For example, if the `CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition` has a `key` attribute of
            `"cocoa_brand"` and the defining application ID is `"abcd1234"`, the key in the map is `"abcd1234:cocoa_brand"`
            if the application making the request is different from the application defining the custom attribute definition.
            Otherwise, the key used in the map is simply `"cocoa_brand"`.

            Application-defined custom attributes that are set at a global (location-independent) level.
            Custom attribute values are intended to store additional information about a catalog object
            or associations with an entity in another system. Do not use custom attributes
            to store any sensitive information (personally identifiable information, card details, etc.).

    CatalogQuery:
      description: |-
        A query composed of one or more different types of filters to narrow the scope of targeted objects when calling the `SearchCatalogObjects` endpoint.

        Although a query can have multiple filters, only certain query types can be combined per call to [SearchCatalogObjects](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-08-18/catalog-api/search-catalog-objects).
        Any combination of the following types may be used together:
        - [exact_query](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-08-18/objects/CatalogQueryExact)
        - [prefix_query](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-08-18/objects/CatalogQueryPrefix)
        - [range_query](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-08-18/objects/CatalogQueryRange)
        - [sorted_attribute_query](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-08-18/objects/CatalogQuerySortedAttribute)
        - [text_query](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-08-18/objects/CatalogQueryText)
        All other query types cannot be combined with any others.

        When a query filter is based on an attribute, the attribute must be searchable.
        Searchable attributes are listed as follows, along their parent types that can be searched for with applicable query filters.

        * Searchable attribute and objects queryable by searchable attributes **
        - `name`:  `CatalogItem`, `CatalogItemVariation`, `CatalogCategory`, `CatalogTax`, `CatalogDiscount`, `CatalogModifier`, 'CatalogModifierList`, `CatalogItemOption`, `CatalogItemOptionValue`
        - `description`: `CatalogItem`, `CatalogItemOptionValue`
        - `abbreviation`: `CatalogItem`
        - `upc`: `CatalogItemVariation`
        - `sku`: `CatalogItemVariation`
        - `caption`: `CatalogImage`
        - `display_name`: `CatalogItemOption`

        For example, to search for [CatalogItem](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-08-18/objects/CatalogItem) objects by searchable attributes, you can use
        the `"name"`, `"description"`, or `"abbreviation"` attribute in an applicable query filter.

            The idempotency key is used to avoid processing the same order more than once. If you are 
            unsure whether a particular checkout was created successfully, you can attempt it again with
            the same idempotency key and all the same other parameters without worrying about creating duplicates.

            You should use a random number/string generator native to the language
            you are working in to generate strings for your idempotency keys.

            <pre><code>http://www.example.com/order-complete?checkoutId=xxxxxx&amp;referenceId=xxxxxx&amp;transactionId=xxxxxx</code></pre>

            If you do not provide a redirect URL, Square Checkout displays an order
            confirmation page on your behalf; however, it is strongly recommended that
            you provide a redirect URL so you can verify the transaction results and
            finalize the order through your existing/normal confirmation workflow.

            payment. This automatic cancellation applies only to payments that do not reach a terminal state
            (COMPLETED, CANCELED, or FAILED) before the `delay_duration` time period.

            This parameter should be specified as a time duration, in RFC 3339 format, with a minimum value
            of 1 minute.

            Note: This feature is only supported for card payments. This parameter can only be set for a delayed
            capture payment (`autocomplete=false`).

            Default:

            - Card-present payments: "PT36H" (36 hours) from the creation time.
            - Card-not-present payments: "P7D" (7 days) from the creation time.

            When a Gift Card is a payment source, you can allow taking a partial payment 
            by adding the `accept_partial_authorization` parameter in the request.

            Application-defined data attached to this service charge. Metadata fields are intended
            to store descriptive references or associations with an entity in another system or store brief
            information about the object. Square does not process this field; it only stores and returns it
            in relevant API calls. Do not use metadata to store any sensitive information (such as personally
            identifiable information or card details).

            Keys written by applications must be 60 characters or less and must be in the character set
            `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`. Entries can also include metadata generated by Square. These keys are prefixed
            with a namespace, separated from the key with a ':' character.

            Values have a maximum length of 255 characters.

            An application can have up to 10 entries per metadata field.

            Entries written by applications are private and can only be read or modified by the same
            application.

    RiskEvaluation:
      description: |-
        Represents fraud risk information for the associated payment.

        When you take a payment through Square's Payments API (using the `CreatePayment`
        endpoint), Square evaluates it and assigns a risk level to the payment. Sellers
        can use this information to determine the course of action (for example,
        provide the goods/services or refund the payment).

        Filter for `Order` objects based on whether their `CREATED_AT`,
        `CLOSED_AT`, or `UPDATED_AT` timestamps fall within a specified time range.
        You can specify the time range and which timestamp to filter for. You can filter
        for only one time range at a time.

        For each time range, the start time and end time are inclusive. If the end time
        is absent, it defaults to the time of the first request for the cursor.

        __Important:__ If you use the `DateTimeFilter` in a `SearchOrders` query,
        you must set the `sort_field` in [OrdersSort](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-08-18/objects/SearchOrdersSort)
        to the same field you filter for. For example, if you set the `CLOSED_AT` field
        in `DateTimeFilter`, you must set the `sort_field` in `SearchOrdersSort` to
        `CLOSED_AT`. Otherwise, `SearchOrders` throws an error.

        </li>
        <li>
        Monetary values are <b>negative</b> if they represent an
        <em>decrease</em> in the amount of money the merchant receives (e.g.,

    V1Tender:
      description: |-
        A tender represents a discrete monetary exchange. Square represents this
        exchange as a money object with a specific currency and amount, where the
        amount is given in the smallest denomination of the given currency.

        Square POS can accept more than one form of tender for a single payment (such
        as by splitting a bill between a credit card and a gift card). The `tender`
        field of the Payment object lists all forms of tender used for the payment.

        Split tender payments behave slightly differently from single tender payments:

        The receipt_url for a split tender corresponds only to the first tender listed
        in the tender field. To get the receipt URLs for the remaining tenders, use
        the receipt_url fields of the corresponding Tender objects.

        *A note on gift cards**: when a customer purchases a Square gift card from a
        merchant, the merchant receives the full amount of the gift card in the
        associated payment.

        When that gift card is used as a tender, the balance of the gift card is
        reduced and the merchant receives no funds. A `Tender` object with a type of
        `SQUARE_GIFT_CARD` indicates a gift card was used for some or all of the
        associated payment.
