Allowed values include:\n`push`, `force`, `delete` and `restrict_merges`.\n\nDifferent kinds of branch restrictions have different requirements:\n\n* `push` and `restrict_merges` require `users` and `groups` to be\n  specified. Empty lists are allowed, in which case permission is\n  denied for everybody.\n\nThe restriction applies to all branches that match. There are\ntwo ways to match a branch. It is configured in `branch_match_kind`:\n\n1. `glob`: Matches a branch against the `pattern`. A `'*'` in\n   `pattern` will expand to match zero or more characters, and every\n   other character matches itself. For example, `'foo*'` will match\n   `'foo'` and `'foobar'`, but not `'barfoo'`. `'*'` will match all\n   branches.\n2. `branching_model`: Matches a branch against the repository's\n   branching model. The `branch_type` controls the type of branch\n   to match. Allowed values include: `production`, `development`,\n   `bugfix`, `release`, `feature` and `hotfix`.\n\nThe combination of `kind` and match must be unique. This means that\ntwo `glob` restrictions in a repository cannot have the same `kind` and\n`pattern`. Additionally, two `branching_model` restrictions in a\nrepository cannot have the same `kind` and `branch_type`.\n\n`users` and `groups` are lists of users and groups that are except from\nthe restriction. They can only be configured in `push` and\n`restrict_merges` restrictions. The `push` restriction stops a user\npushing to matching branches unless that user is in `users` or is a\nmember of a group in `groups`. The `restrict_merges` stops a user\nmerging pull requests to matching branches unless that user is in\n`users` or is a member of a group in `groups`. Adding new users or\ngroups to an existing restriction should be done via `PUT`.\n\nNote that branch restrictions with overlapping matchers is allowed,\nbut the resulting behavior may be surprising.",

When set to a specific branch it must\ncurrently exist. Only the passed properties will be updated. The\nproperties not passed will be left unchanged. A request without a\n`development` property will leave the development branch unchanged.\n\nIt is possible for the `development` branch to be invalid. This\nhappens when it points at a specific branch that has been\ndeleted. This is indicated in the `is_valid` field for the branch. It is\nnot possible to update the settings for `development` if that\nwould leave the branch in an invalid state. Such a request will be\nrejected.\n\nThe `production` branch can be a specific branch, the main\nbranch or disabled. When set to a specific branch it must currently\nexist. The `enabled` property can be used to enable (`true`) or\ndisable (`false`) it. Only the passed properties will be updated. The\nproperties not passed will be left unchanged. A request without a\n`production` property will leave the production branch unchanged.\n\nIt is possible for the `production` branch to be invalid. This\nhappens when it points at a specific branch that has been\ndeleted. This is indicated in the `is_valid` field for the branch. A\nrequest that would leave `production` enabled and invalid will be\nrejected. It is possible to update `production` and make it invalid if\nit would also be left disabled.\n\nThe `branch_types` property contains the branch types to be updated.\nOnly the branch types passed will be updated. All updates will be\nrejected if it would leave the branching model in an invalid state.\nFor branch types this means that:\n\n1. The prefixes for all enabled branch types are valid. For example,\n   it is not possible to use '*' inside a Git prefix.\n2. A prefix of an enabled branch type must not be a prefix of another\n   enabled branch type. This is to ensure that a branch can be easily\n   classified by its prefix unambiguously.\n\nIt is possible to store an invalid prefix if that branch type would be\nleft disabled. Only the passed properties will be updated. The\nproperties not passed will be left unchanged. Each branch type must\nhave a `kind` property to identify it.\n\nExample Body:\n\n```\n    {\n      \"development\": {\n        \"use_mainbranch\": true\n      },\n      \"production\": {\n        \"enabled\": true,\n        \"use_mainbranch\": false,\n        \"name\": \"production\"\n      },\n      \"branch_types\": [\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"bugfix\",\n          \"enabled\": true,\n          \"prefix\": \"bugfix/\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"feature\",\n          \"enabled\": true,\n          \"prefix\": \"feature/\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"hotfix\",\n          \"prefix\": \"hotfix/\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"release\",\n          \"enabled\": false,\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n```\n\nThere is currently a side effect when using this API endpoint. If the\nrepository is inheriting branching model settings from its project,\nupdating the branching model for this repository will disable the\nproject setting inheritance.\n\n\nWe have deprecated this side effect and will remove it on 1 August 2022.",

If you want to use an existing id from your own system, we recommend prefixing it with your system's name to avoid collisions, for example, mySystem-annotation001.\n\n### Sample cURL request:\n```\ncurl --request PUT 'https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/<username>/<reposity-name>/commit/<commit-hash>/reports/mySystem-001/annotations/mysystem-annotation001' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--data-raw '{\n    \"title\": \"Security scan report\",\n    \"annotation_type\": \"VULNERABILITY\",\n    \"summary\": \"This line represents a security thread.\",\n    \"severity\": \"HIGH\",\n    \"path\": \"my-service/src/main/java/com/myCompany/mysystem/logic/Main.java\",\n    \"line\": 42\n}'\n```\n\n### Possible field values:\nannotation_type: VULNERABILITY, CODE_SMELL, BUG\nresult: PASSED, FAILED, IGNORED, SKIPPED\nseverity: HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, CRITICAL\n\nPlease refer to the [Code Insights documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/code-insights-994316785.html) for more information.\n",

It is\nderived from `name` by substituting non-ASCII characters, removes\nwhitespace, and changes characters to lower case. For example,\n`My repo` would turn into `my_repo`.\n\nYou need contributor access to create new forks within a workspace.\n\n\n#### Change the properties of a new fork\n\nBy default the fork inherits most of its properties from the parent.\nHowever, since the optional POST body document follows the normal\n`repository` JSON schema and you can override the new fork's\nproperties.\n\nProperties that can be overridden include:\n\n* description\n* fork_policy\n* language\n* mainbranch\n* is_private (note that a private repo's fork_policy might prohibit\n  the creation of public forks, in which `is_private=False` would fail)\n* has_issues (to initialize or disable the new repo's issue tracker --\n  note that the actual contents of the parent repository's issue\n  tracker are not copied during forking)\n* has_wiki (to initialize or disable the new repo's wiki --\n  note that the actual contents of the parent repository's wiki are not\n  copied during forking)\n* project (when forking into a private project, the fork's `is_private`\n  must be `true`)\n\nProperties that cannot be modified include:\n\n* scm\n* parent\n* full_name",

        "description": "Endpoint to create and initiate a pipeline.\nThere are a couple of different options to initiate a pipeline, where the payload of the request will determine which type of pipeline will be instantiated.\n# Trigger a Pipeline for a branch\nOne way to trigger pipelines is by specifying the branch for which you want to trigger a pipeline.\nThe specified branch will be used to determine which pipeline definition from the `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file will be applied to initiate the pipeline. The pipeline will then do a clone of the repository and checkout the latest revision of the specified branch.\n\n### Example\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \\\n  -d '\n  {\n    \"target\": {\n      \"ref_type\": \"branch\",\n      \"type\": \"pipeline_ref_target\",\n      \"ref_name\": \"master\"\n    }\n  }'\n```\n# Trigger a Pipeline for a commit on a branch or tag\nYou can initiate a pipeline for a specific commit and in the context of a specified reference (e.g. a branch, tag or bookmark).\nThe specified reference will be used to determine which pipeline definition from the bitbucket-pipelines.yml file will be applied to initiate the pipeline. The pipeline will clone the repository and then do a checkout the specified reference.\n\nThe following reference types are supported:\n\n* `branch`\n* `named_branch`\n* `bookmark`\n * `tag`\n\n### Example\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \\\n  -d '\n  {\n    \"target\": {\n      \"commit\": {\n        \"type\": \"commit\",\n        \"hash\": \"ce5b7431602f7cbba007062eeb55225c6e18e956\"\n      },\n      \"ref_type\": \"branch\",\n      \"type\": \"pipeline_ref_target\",\n      \"ref_name\": \"master\"\n    }\n  }'\n```\n# Trigger a specific pipeline definition for a commit\nYou can trigger a specific pipeline that is defined in your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file for a specific commit.\nIn addition to the commit revision, you specify the type and pattern of the selector that identifies the pipeline definition. The resulting pipeline will then clone the repository and checkout the specified revision.\n\n### Example\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \\\n -d '\n  {\n     \"target\": {\n      \"commit\": {\n         \"hash\":\"a3c4e02c9a3755eccdc3764e6ea13facdf30f923\",\n         \"type\":\"commit\"\n       },\n        \"selector\": {\n           \"type\":\"custom\",\n              \"pattern\":\"Deploy to production\"\n          },\n        \"type\":\"pipeline_commit_target\"\n   }\n  }'\n```\n# Trigger a specific pipeline definition for a commit on a branch or tag\nYou can trigger a specific pipeline that is defined in your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file for a specific commit in the context of a specified reference.\nIn addition to the commit revision, you specify the type and pattern of the selector that identifies the pipeline definition, as well as the reference information. The resulting pipeline will then clone the repository a checkout the specified reference.\n\n### Example\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \\\n -d '\n  {\n     \"target\": {\n      \"commit\": {\n         \"hash\":\"a3c4e02c9a3755eccdc3764e6ea13facdf30f923\",\n         \"type\":\"commit\"\n       },\n       \"selector\": {\n          \"type\": \"custom\",\n          \"pattern\": \"Deploy to production\"\n       },\n       \"type\": \"pipeline_ref_target\",\n       \"ref_name\": \"master\",\n       \"ref_type\": \"branch\"\n     }\n  }'\n```\n\n\n# Trigger a custom pipeline with variables\nIn addition to triggering a custom pipeline that is defined in your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file as shown in the examples above, you can specify variables that will be available for your build. In the request, provide a list of variables, specifying the following for each variable: key, value, and whether it should be secured or not (this field is optional and defaults to not secured).\n\n### Example\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/pipelines/ \\\n -d '\n  {\n    \"target\": {\n      \"type\": \"pipeline_ref_target\",\n      \"ref_type\": \"branch\",\n      \"ref_name\": \"master\",\n      \"selector\": {\n        \"type\": \"custom\",\n        \"pattern\": \"Deploy to production\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"variables\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"var1key\",\n        \"value\": \"var1value\",\n        \"secured\": true\n      },\n      {\n        \"key\": \"var2key\",\n        \"value\": \"var2value\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }'\n```\n\n# Trigger a pull request pipeline\n\nYou can also initiate a pipeline for a specific pull request.\n\n### Example\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/pipelines/ \\\n -d '\n  {\n\t\"target\": {\n      \"type\": \"pipeline_pullrequest_target\",\n\t  \"source\": \"pull-request-branch\",\n      \"destination\": \"master\",\n      \"destination_commit\": {\n      \t \"hash\" : \"9f848b7\"\n      },\n      \"commit\": {\n      \t\"hash\" : \"1a372fc\"\n      },\n      \"pullrequest\" : {\n      \t\"id\" : \"3\"\n      },\n\t  \"selector\": {\n        \"type\": \"pull-requests\",\n        \"pattern\": \"**\"\n      }\n    }\n  }'\n```\n",

sorting](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro/#filtering)\n        that can be used to search for specific branches. For instance, to find\n        all branches that have \"stab\" in their name:\n\n        ```\n        curl -s https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/aui/refs/branches -G --data-urlencode 'q=name ~ \"stab\"'\n        ```\n\n        By default, results will be in the order the underlying source control system returns them and identical to\n        the ordering one sees when running \"$ git branch --list\". Note that this follows simple\n        lexical ordering of the ref names.\n\n        This can be undesirable as it does apply any natural sorting semantics, meaning for instance that tags are\n        sorted [\"v10\", \"v11\", \"v9\"] instead of [\"v9\", \"v10\", \"v11\"].\n\n        Sorting can be changed using the ?q= query parameter. When using ?q=name to explicitly sort on ref name,\n        Bitbucket will apply natural sorting and interpret numerical values as numbers instead of strings.",

        "description": "This endpoint is used to create new commits in the repository by\nuploading files.\n\nTo add a new file to a repository:\n\n```\n$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/username/slug/src \\\n  -F /repo/path/to/image.png=@image.png\n```\n\nThis will create a new commit on top of the main branch, inheriting the\ncontents of the main branch, but adding (or overwriting) the\n`image.png` file to the repository in the `/repo/path/to` directory.\n\nTo create a commit that deletes files, use the `files` parameter:\n\n```\n$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/username/slug/src \\\n  -F files=/file/to/delete/1.txt \\\n  -F files=/file/to/delete/2.txt\n```\n\nYou can add/modify/delete multiple files in a request. Rename/move a\nfile by deleting the old path and adding the content at the new path.\n\nThis endpoint accepts `multipart/form-data` (as in the examples above),\nas well as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.\n\n#### multipart/form-data\n\nA `multipart/form-data` post contains a series of \"form fields\" that\nidentify both the individual files that are being uploaded, as well as\nadditional, optional meta data.\n\nFiles are uploaded in file form fields (those that have a\n`Content-Disposition` parameter) whose field names point to the remote\npath in the repository where the file should be stored. Path field\nnames are always interpreted to be absolute from the root of the\nrepository, regardless whether the client uses a leading slash (as the\nabove `curl` example did).\n\nFile contents are treated as bytes and are not decoded as text.\n\nThe commit message, as well as other non-file meta data for the\nrequest, is sent along as normal form field elements. Meta data fields\nshare the same namespace as the file objects. For `multipart/form-data`\nbodies that should not lead to any ambiguity, as the\n`Content-Disposition` header will contain the `filename` parameter to\ndistinguish between a file named \"message\" and the commit message field.\n\n#### application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nIt is also possible to upload new files using a simple\n`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` POST. This can be convenient when\nuploading pure text files:\n\n```\n$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src \\\n  --data-urlencode \"/path/to/me.txt=Lorem ipsum.\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"message=Initial commit\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"author=Erik van Zijst <erik.van.zijst@gmail.com>\"\n```\n\nThere could be a field name clash if a client were to upload a file\nnamed \"message\", as this filename clashes with the meta data property\nfor the commit message. To avoid this and to upload files whose names\nclash with the meta data properties, use a leading slash for the files,\ne.g. `curl --data-urlencode \"/message=file contents\"`.\n\nWhen an explicit slash is omitted for a file whose path matches that of\na meta data parameter, then it is interpreted as meta data, not as a\nfile.\n\n#### Executables and links\n\nWhile this API aims to facilitate the most common use cases, it is\npossible to perform some more advanced operations like creating a new\nsymlink in the repository, or creating an executable file.\n\nFiles can be supplied with a `x-attributes` value in the\n`Content-Disposition` header. For example, to upload an executable\nfile, as well as create a symlink from `README.txt` to `README`:\n\n```\n--===============1438169132528273974==\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nContent-ID: \"bin/shutdown.sh\"\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"shutdown.sh\"; x-attributes:\"executable\"\n\n#!/bin/sh\nhalt\n\n--===============1438169132528273974==\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nContent-ID: \"/README.txt\"\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"README.txt\"; x-attributes:\"link\"\n\nREADME\n--===============1438169132528273974==--\n```\n\nLinks are files that contain the target path and have\n`x-attributes:\"link\"` set.\n\nWhen overwriting links with files, or vice versa, the newly uploaded\nfile determines both the new contents, as well as the attributes. That\nmeans uploading a file without specifying `x-attributes=\"link\"` will\ncreate a regular file, even if the parent commit hosted a symlink at\nthe same path.\n\nThe same applies to executables. When modifying an existing executable\nfile, the form-data file element must include\n`x-attributes=\"executable\"` in order to preserve the executable status\nof the file.\n\nNote that this API does not support the creation or manipulation of\nsubrepos / submodules.",

The file contents are not processed\nand no character encoding/recoding is performed and as a result no\ncharacter encoding is included as part of the Content-Type.\n\nThe `Content-Disposition` header will be \"attachment\" to prevent\nbrowsers from running executable files.\n\nIf the file is managed by LFS, then a 301 redirect pointing to\nAtlassian's media services platform is returned.\n\nThe response includes an ETag that is based on the contents of the file\nand its attributes. This means that an empty `__init__.py` always\nreturns the same ETag, regardless on the directory it lives in, or the\ncommit it is on.\n\n#### File meta data\n\nWhen the request for a file path includes the query parameter\n`?format=meta`, instead of returning the file's raw contents, Bitbucket\ninstead returns the JSON object describing the file's properties:\n\n```javascript\n$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef/tests/__init__.py?format=meta\n{\n  \"links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/__init__.py\"\n    },\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/__init__.py?format=meta\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"path\": \"tests/__init__.py\",\n  \"commit\": {\n    \"type\": \"commit\",\n    \"hash\": \"eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\",\n    \"links\": {\n      \"self\": {\n        \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/commit/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\"\n      },\n      \"html\": {\n        \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/bbql/commits/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"attributes\": [],\n  \"type\": \"commit_file\",\n  \"size\": 0\n}\n```\n\nFile objects contain an `attributes` element that contains a list of\npossible modifiers. Currently defined values are:\n\n* `link` -- indicates that the entry is a symbolic link. The contents\n    of the file represent the path the link points to.\n* `executable` -- indicates that the file has the executable bit set.\n* `subrepository` -- indicates that the entry points to a submodule or\n    subrepo. The contents of the file is the SHA1 of the repository\n    pointed to.\n* `binary` -- indicates whether Bitbucket thinks the file is binary.\n\nThis endpoint can provide an alternative to how a HEAD request can be\nused to check for the existence of a file, or a file's size without\nincurring the overhead of receiving its full contents.\n\n\n#### Directory listings\n\nWhen `path` points to a directory instead of a file, the response is a\npaginated list of directory and file objects in the same order as the\nunderlying SCM system would return them.\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\n$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef/tests\n{\n  \"pagelen\": 10,\n  \"values\": [\n    {\n      \"path\": \"tests/test_project\",\n      \"type\": \"commit_directory\",\n      \"links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/\"\n        },\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/?format=meta\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"commit\": {\n        \"type\": \"commit\",\n        \"hash\": \"eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\",\n        \"links\": {\n          \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/commit/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\"\n          },\n          \"html\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/bbql/commits/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/__init__.py\"\n        },\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/__init__.py?format=meta\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"path\": \"tests/__init__.py\",\n      \"commit\": {\n        \"type\": \"commit\",\n        \"hash\": \"eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\",\n        \"links\": {\n          \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/commit/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\"\n          },\n          \"html\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/bbql/commits/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"attributes\": [],\n      \"type\": \"commit_file\",\n      \"size\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"page\": 1,\n  \"size\": 2\n}\n```\n\nWhen listing the contents of the repo's root directory, the use of a\ntrailing slash at the end of the URL is required.\n\nThe response by default is not recursive, meaning that only the direct contents of\na path are returned. The response does not recurse down into\nsubdirectories. In order to \"walk\" the entire directory tree, the\nclient can either parse each response and follow the `self` links of each\n`commit_directory` object, or can specify a `max_depth` to recurse to.\n\nThe max_depth parameter will do a breadth-first search to return the contents of the subdirectories\nup to the depth specified. Breadth-first search was chosen as it leads to the least amount of\nfile system operations for git. If the `max_depth` parameter is specified to be too\nlarge, the call will time out and return a 555.\n\nEach returned object is either a `commit_file`, or a `commit_directory`,\nboth of which contain a `path` element. This path is the absolute path\nfrom the root of the repository. Each object also contains a `commit`\nobject which embeds the commit the file is on. Note that this is merely\nthe commit that was used in the URL. It is *not* the commit that last\nmodified the file.\n\nDirectory objects have 2 representations. Their `self` link returns the\npaginated contents of the directory. The `meta` link on the other hand\nreturns the actual `directory` object itself, e.g.:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"path\": \"tests/test_project\",\n  \"type\": \"commit_directory\",\n  \"links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/\"\n    },\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/?format=meta\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"commit\": { ... }\n}\n```\n\n#### Querying, filtering and sorting\n\nLike most API endpoints, this API supports the Bitbucket\nquerying/filtering syntax and so you could filter a directory listing\nto only include entries that match certain criteria. For instance, to\nlist all binary files over 1kb use the expression:\n\n`size > 1024 and attributes = \"binary\"`\n\nwhich after urlencoding yields the query string:\n\n`?q=size%3E1024+and+attributes%3D%22binary%22`\n\nTo change the ordering of the response, use the `?sort` parameter:\n\n`.../src/eefd5ef/?sort=-size`\n\nSee [filtering and sorting](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro/#filtering) for more\ndetails.",

Both allow the creation of\nsnippets with both meta data (title, etc), as well as multiple text\nand binary files.\n\nThe main difference is that `multipart/related` can use rich encoding\nfor the meta data (currently JSON).\n\n\nmultipart/related (RFC-2387)\n----------------------------\n\nThis is the most advanced and efficient way to create a paste.\n\n    POST /2.0/snippets/evzijst HTTP/1.1\n    Content-Length: 1188\n    Content-Type: multipart/related; start=\"snippet\"; boundary=\"===============1438169132528273974==\"\n    MIME-Version: 1.0\n\n    --===============1438169132528273974==\n    Content-Type: application/json; charset=\"utf-8\"\n    MIME-Version: 1.0\n    Content-ID: snippet\n\n    {\n      \"title\": \"My snippet\",\n      \"is_private\": true,\n      \"scm\": \"git\",\n      \"files\": {\n          \"foo.txt\": {},\n          \"image.png\": {}\n        }\n    }\n\n    --===============1438169132528273974==\n    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"\n    MIME-Version: 1.0\n    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\n    Content-ID: \"foo.txt\"\n    Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"foo.txt\"\n\n    foo\n\n    --===============1438169132528273974==\n    Content-Type: image/png\n    MIME-Version: 1.0\n    Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64\n    Content-ID: \"image.png\"\n    Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"image.png\"\n\n    iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAoCAYAAAD+MdrbAAABD0lEQVR4Ae3VMUoDQRTG8ccUaW2m\n    TKONFxArJYJamCvkCnZTaa+VnQdJSBFl2SMsLFrEWNjZBZs0JgiL/+KrhhVmJRbCLPx4O+/DT2TB\n    cbblJxf+UWFVVRNsEGAtgvJxnLm2H+A5RQ93uIl+3632PZyl/skjfOn9Gvdwmlcw5aPUwimG+NT5\n    EnNN036IaZePUuIcK533NVfal7/5yjWeot2z9ta1cAczHEf7I+3J0ws9Cgx0fsOFpmlfwKcWPuBQ\n    73Oc4FHzBaZ8llq4q1mr5B2mOUCt815qYR8eB1hG2VJ7j35q4RofaH7IG+Xrf/PfJhfmwtfFYoIN\n    AqxFUD6OMxcvkO+UfKfkOyXfKdsv/AYCHMLVkHAFWgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\n    --===============1438169132528273974==--\n\nThe request contains multiple parts and is structured as follows.\n\nThe first part is the JSON document that describes the snippet's\nproperties or meta data. It either has to be the first part, or the\nrequest's `Content-Type` header must contain the `start` parameter to\npoint to it.\n\nThe remaining parts are the files of which there can be zero or more.\nEach file part should contain the `Content-ID` MIME header through\nwhich the JSON meta data's `files` element addresses it. The value\nshould be the name of the file.\n\n`Content-Disposition` is an optional MIME header. The header's\noptional `filename` parameter can be used to specify the file name\nthat Bitbucket should use when writing the file to disk. When present,\n`filename` takes precedence over the value of `Content-ID`.\n\nWhen the JSON body omits the `files` element, the remaining parts are\nnot ignored. Instead, each file is added to the new snippet as if its\nname was explicitly linked (the use of the `files` elements is\nmandatory for some operations like deleting or renaming files).\n\n\nmultipart/form-data\n-------------------\n\nThe use of JSON for the snippet's meta data is optional. Meta data can\nalso be supplied as regular form fields in a more conventional\n`multipart/form-data` request:\n\n    $ curl -X POST -u credentials https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets               -F title=\"My snippet\"               -F file=@foo.txt -F file=@image.png\n\n    POST /2.0/snippets HTTP/1.1\n    Content-Length: 951\n    Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----------------------------63a4b224c59f\n\n    ------------------------------63a4b224c59f\n    Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"foo.txt\"\n    Content-Type: text/plain\n\n    foo\n\n    ------------------------------63a4b224c59f\n    Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"image.png\"\n    Content-Type: application/octet-stream\n\n    ?PNG\n\n    IHDR?1??I.....\n    ------------------------------63a4b224c59f\n    Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"title\"\n\n    My snippet\n    ------------------------------63a4b224c59f--\n\nHere the meta data properties are included as flat, top-level form\nfields. The file attachments use the `file` field name. To attach\nmultiple files, simply repeat the field.\n\nThe advantage of `multipart/form-data` over `multipart/related` is\nthat it can be easier to build clients.\n\nEssentially all properties are optional, `title` and `files` included.\n\n\nSharing and Visibility\n----------------------\n\nSnippets can be either public (visible to anyone on Bitbucket, as well\nas anonymous users), or private (visible only to members of the workspace).\nThis is controlled through the snippet's `is_private` element:\n\n* **is_private=false** -- everyone, including anonymous users can view\n  the snippet\n* **is_private=true** -- only workspace members can view the snippet\n\nTo create the snippet under a workspace, just append the workspace ID\nto the URL.

Use this to add and delete files and to\nchange a snippet's title.\n\nTo update a snippet, one can either PUT a full snapshot, or only the\nparts that need to be changed.\n\nThe contract for PUT on this API is that properties missing from the\nrequest remain untouched so that snippets can be efficiently\nmanipulated with differential payloads.\n\nTo delete a property (e.g. the title, or a file), include its name in\nthe request, but omit its value (use `null`).\n\nAs in Git, explicit renaming of files is not supported. Instead, to\nrename a file, delete it and add it again under another name. This can\nbe done atomically in a single request. Rename detection is left to\nthe SCM.\n\nPUT supports three different content types for both request and\nresponse bodies:\n\n* `application/json`\n* `multipart/related`\n* `multipart/form-data`\n\nThe content type used for the request body can be different than that\nused for the response. Content types are specified using standard HTTP\nheaders.\n\nUse the `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers to select the desired\nrequest and response format.\n\n\napplication/json\n----------------\n\nAs with creation and retrieval, the content type determines what\nproperties can be manipulated. `application/json` does not support\nfile contents and is therefore limited to a snippet's meta data.\n\nTo update the title, without changing any of its files:\n\n    $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj             -d '{\"title\": \"Updated title\"}'\n\n\nTo delete the title:\n\n    $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj             -d '{\"title\": null}'\n\nNot all parts of a snippet can be manipulated. The owner and creator\nfor instance are immutable.\n\n\nmultipart/related\n-----------------\n\n`multipart/related` can be used to manipulate all of a snippet's\nproperties. The body is identical to a POST. properties omitted from\nthe request are left unchanged.

This is to ensure that a branch can be easily\n   classified by its prefix unambiguously.\n\nIt is possible to store an invalid prefix if that branch type would be\nleft disabled. Only the passed properties will be updated. The\nproperties not passed will be left unchanged. Each branch type must\nhave a `kind` property to identify it.\n\nExample Body:\n\n```\n    {\n      \"development\": {\n        \"use_mainbranch\": true\n      },\n      \"production\": {\n        \"enabled\": true,\n        \"use_mainbranch\": false,\n        \"name\": \"production\"\n      },\n      \"branch_types\": [\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"bugfix\",\n          \"enabled\": true,\n          \"prefix\": \"bugfix/\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"feature\",\n          \"enabled\": true,\n          \"prefix\": \"feature/\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"hotfix\",\n          \"prefix\": \"hotfix/\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"release\",\n          \"enabled\": false,\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n```",

The only thing you need to do is edit your\nexisting consumer and configure a callback URL.\n\nOnce that is in place, you'll have the following 2 URLs:\n\n    https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize\n    https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token\n\nFor obtaining access/bearer tokens, we support three of RFC-6749's grant\nflows, plus a custom Bitbucket flow for exchanging JWT tokens for access tokens.\nNote that Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant (4.3) is no longer supported.\n\n\n#### 1. Authorization Code Grant (4.1)\n\nThe full-blown 3-LO flow. Request authorization from the end user by\nsending their browser to:\n\n    https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&response_type=code\n\nThe callback includes the `?code={}` query parameter that you can swap\nfor an access token:\n\n    $ curl -X POST -u \"client_id:secret\" \\\n      https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \\\n      -d grant_type=authorization_code -d code={code}\n\n\n#### 2. Implicit Grant (4.2)\n\nThis flow is useful for browser-based add-ons that operate without server-side backends.\n\nRequest the end user for authorization by directing the browser to:\n\n    https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&response_type=token\n\nThat will redirect to your preconfigured callback URL with a fragment\ncontaining the access token\n(`#access_token={token}&token_type=bearer`) where your page's js can\npull it out of the URL.\n\n\n#### 3. Client Credentials Grant (4.4)\n\nSomewhat like our existing \"2-LO\" flow for OAuth 1. Obtain an access\ntoken that represents not an end user, but the owner of the\nclient/consumer:\n\n    $ curl -X POST -u \"client_id:secret\" \\\n      https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \\\n      -d grant_type=client_credentials\n\n\n#### 4. Bitbucket Cloud JWT Grant (urn:bitbucket:oauth2:jwt)\n\nIf your Atlassian Connect add-on uses JWT authentication, you can swap a\nJWT for an OAuth access token. The resulting access token represents the\naccount for which the add-on is installed.\n\nMake sure you send the JWT token in the Authorization request header\nusing the \"JWT\" scheme (case sensitive). Note that this custom scheme\nmakes this different from HTTP Basic Auth (and so you cannot use \"curl\n-u\").\n\n    $ curl -X POST -H \"Authorization: JWT {jwt_token}\" \\\n      https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \\\n      -d grant_type=urn:bitbucket:oauth2:jwt\n\n\n#### Making Requests\n\nOnce you have an access token, as per RFC-6750, you can use it in a request in any of\nthe following ways (in decreasing order of desirability):\n\n1. Send it in a request header: `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`\n2. Include it in a (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) POST body as `access_token={access_token}`\n3. Put it in the query string of a non-POST: `?access_token={access_token}`\n\n\n#### Repository Cloning\n\nSince add-ons will not be able to upload their own SSH keys to clone\nwith, access tokens can be used as Basic HTTP Auth credentials to\nclone securely over HTTPS. This is much like GitHub, yet slightly\ndifferent:\n\n    $ git clone https://x-token-auth:{access_token}@bitbucket.org/user/repo.git\n\nThe literal string `x-token-auth` as a substitute for username is\nrequired (note the difference with GitHub where the actual token is in\nthe username field).\n\n\n#### Refresh Tokens\n\nOur access tokens expire in one hour. When this happens you'll get 401\nresponses.\n\nMost access tokens grant responses (Implicit and JWT excluded). Therefore, you should include a\nrefresh token that can then be used to generate a new access token,\nwithout the need for end user participation:\n\n    $ curl -X POST -u \"client_id:secret\" \\\n      https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \\\n      -d grant_type=refresh_token -d refresh_token={refresh_token}\n\n\n### Scopes\n\nBitbucket's API applies a number of privilege scopes to endpoints. In order to access an endpoint, a request will need to have the necessary scopes.\n\nScopes are declared in the descriptor as a list of strings, with each string being the name of a unique scope.\n\nA descriptor lacking the `scopes` element is implicitly assumed to require all scopes and as a result, Bitbucket will require end users authorizing/installing the add-on\nto explicitly accept all scopes.\n\nOur best practice suggests you add the scopes your add-on needs, but no more than it needs.\n\nInvalid scope strings will cause the descriptor to be rejected and the installation to fail.\n\nThe available scopes are:\n\n- [project](#project)\n- [project:write](#project-write)\n- [project:admin](#project-admin)\n- [repository](#repository)\n- [repository:write](#repository-write)\n- [repository:admin](#repository-admin)\n- [repository:delete](#repository-delete)\n- [pullrequest](#pullrequest)\n- [pullrequest:write](#pullrequest-write)\n- [issue](#issue)\n- [issue:write](#issue-write)\n- [wiki](#wiki)\n- [webhook](#webhook)\n- [snippet](#snippet)\n- [snippet:write](#snippet-write)\n- [email](#email)\n- [account](#account)\n- [account:write](#account-write)\n- [pipeline](#pipeline)\n- [pipeline:write](#pipeline-write)\n- [pipeline:variable](#pipeline-variable)\n- [runner](#runner)\n- [runner:write](#runner-write)\n\n#### project\n\nProvides access to view the project or projects.\nThis scope implies the [`repository`](#repository) scope, giving read access to all the repositories in a project or projects.\n\n#### project:write\n\nThis scope is deprecated, and has been made obsolete by `project:admin`. Please see the deprecation notice [here](/cloud/bitbucket/deprecation-notice-project-write-scope).\n\n#### project:admin\n\nProvides admin access to a project or projects. No distinction is made between public and private projects. This scope doesn't implicitly grant the [`project`](#project) scope or the [`repository:write`](#repository-write) scope on any repositories under the project. It gives access to the admin features of a project only, not direct access to its repositories' contents.\n\n* ability to create the project\n* ability to update the project\n* ability to delete the project\n\n#### repository\n\nProvides read access to a repository or repositories.\nNote that this scope does not give access to a repository's pull requests.\n\n* access to the repo's source code\n* clone over HTTPS\n* access the file browsing API\n* download zip archives of the repo's contents\n* the ability to view and use the issue tracker on any repo (created issues, comment, vote, etc)\n* the ability to view and use the wiki on any repo (create/edit pages)\n\n#### repository:write\n\nProvides write (not admin) access to a repository or repositories. No distinction is made between public and private repositories. This scope implicitly grants the [`repository`](#repository) scope, which does not need to be requested separately.\nThis scope alone does not give access to the pull requests API.\n\n* push access over HTTPS\n* fork repos\n\n#### repository:admin\n\nProvides admin access to a repository or repositories. No distinction is made between public and private repositories. This scope doesn't implicitly grant the [`repository`](#repository) or the [`repository:write`](#repository-write) scopes. It gives access to the admin features of a repo only, not direct access to its contents. This scope can be used or misused to grant read access to other users, who can then clone the repo, but users that need to read and write source code would also request explicit read or write.\nThis scope comes with access to the following functionality:\n\n* View and manipulate committer mappings\n* List and edit deploy keys\n* Ability to delete the repo\n* View and edit repo permissions\n* View and edit branch permissions\n* Import and export the issue tracker\n* Enable and disable the issue tracker\n* List and edit issue tracker version, milestones and components\n* Enable and disable the wiki\n* List and edit default reviewers\n* List and edit repo links (Jira/Bamboo/Custom)\n* List and edit the repository webhooks\n* Initiate a repo ownership transfer\n\n#### repository:delete\n\nProvides access to delete a repository or repositories.\n\n#### pullrequest\n\nProvides read access to pull requests.\nThis scope implies the [`repository`](#repository) scope, giving read access to the pull request's destination repository.\n\n* see and list pull requests\n* create and resolve tasks\n* comment on pull requests\n\n#### pullrequest:write\n\nImplicitly grants the [`pullrequest`](#pullrequest) scope and adds the ability to create, merge and decline pull requests.\nThis scope also implicitly grants the [`repository:write`](#repository-write) scope, giving write access to the pull request's destination repository. This is necessary to allow merging.\n\n* merge pull requests\n* decline pull requests\n* create pull requests\n* approve pull requests\n\n#### issue\n\nAbility to interact with issue trackers the way non-repo members can.\nThis scope doesn't implicitly grant any other scopes and doesn't give implicit access to the repository.\n\n* view, list and search issues\n* create new issues\n* comment on issues\n* watch issues\n* vote for issues\n\n#### issue:write\n\nThis scope implicitly grants the [`issue`](#issue) scope and adds the ability to transition and delete issues.\nThis scope doesn't implicitly grant any other scopes and doesn't give implicit access to the repository.\n\n* transition issues\n* delete issues\n\n#### wiki\n\nProvides access to wikis. This scope provides both read and write access (wikis are always editable by anyone with access to them).\nThis scope doesn't implicitly grant any other scopes and doesn't give implicit access to the repository.\n\n* view wikis\n* create pages\n* edit pages\n* push to wikis\n* clone wikis\n\n#### webhook\n\nGives access to webhooks. This scope is required for any webhook-related operation.\n\nThis scope gives read access to existing webhook subscriptions on all\nresources the authorization mechanism can access, without needing further scopes.\nFor example:\n\n- A client can list all existing webhook subscriptions on a repository. The [`repository`](#repository) scope is not required.\n- Existing webhook subscriptions for the issue tracker on a repo can be retrieved without the [`issue`](#issue) scope. All that is required is the `webhook` scope.\n\nTo create webhooks, the client will need read access to the resource. Such as: for [`issue:created`](#issue-created), the client will need to\nhave both the `webhook` and the [`issue`](#issue) scope.\n\n* list webhook subscriptions on any accessible repository, user, team, or snippet\n* create/update/delete webhook subscriptions.\n\n#### snippet\n\nProvides read access to snippets.\nNo distinction is made between public and private snippets (public snippets are accessible without any form of authentication).\n\n* view any snippet\n* create snippet comments\n\n#### snippet:write\n\nProvides write access to snippets.\nNo distinction is made between public and private snippets (public snippets are accessible without any form of authentication).\nThis scope implicitly grants the [`snippet`](#snippet) scope which does not need to be requested separately.\n\n* create snippets\n* edit snippets\n* delete snippets\n\n#### email\n\nAbility to see the user's primary email address. This should make it easier to use Bitbucket Cloud as a login provider for apps or external applications.\n\n#### account\n\nWhen used for:\n* **user-related APIs** — Gives read-only access to the user's account information.\nNote that this doesn't include any ability to change any of the data. This scope allows you to view the user's:\n  * email addresses\n  * language\n  * location\n  * website\n  * full name\n  * SSH keys\n  * user groups\n* **workspace-related APIs** — Grants access to view the workspace's:\n  * users\n  * user permissions\n  * projects\n\n#### account:write\n\nAbility to change properties on the user's account.\n\n* delete the authorizing user's account\n* manage the user's groups\n* change a user's email addresses\n* change username, display name and avatar\n\n#### pipeline\n\nGives read-only access to pipelines, steps, deployment environments and variables.\n\n#### pipeline:write\n\nGives write access to pipelines. This scope allows a user to:\n* Stop pipelines\n* Rerun failed pipelines\n* Resume halted pipelines\n* Trigger manual pipelines.\n\nThis scope is not needed to trigger a build using a push. Performing a `git push` (or equivalent actions) will trigger the build. The token doing the push only needs the [`repository:write`](#repository-write) scope.\n\nThis doesn't give write access to create variables.\n\n#### pipeline:variable\n\nGives write access to create variables in pipelines at the various levels:\n* Workspace\n* Repository\n* Deployment\n\n#### runner\n\nGives read-only access to pipelines runners setup against a workspace or repository.\n\n#### runner:write\n\nGives write access to create/edit/disable/delete pipelines runners setup against a workspace or repository.\n\n### Basic auth\n\nBasic HTTP Authentication as per [RFC-2617](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617) (Digest not supported).\nNote that Basic Auth is available only with username and [app password](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/) as credentials.\n\n### Access Tokens\n\nAccess Tokens are passwords (or tokens) that provide access to a _single_ repository, project or workspace.\nThese tokens can authenticate with Bitbucket APIs for scripting, CI/CD tools, Bitbucket Cloud-connected apps,\nand Bitbucket Cloud integrations.\n\nAccess Tokens are linked to a repository, project, or workspace, not a user account.\nThe level of access provided by the token is set when a repository, or workspace admin creates it,\nby setting permission scopes.\n\nThere are three types of Access Token:\n\n* **Repository Access Tokens** can connect to a single repository, preventing them from accessing any other repositories or workspaces.\n* **Project Access Tokens** can connect to a project, providing access to any repositories within the project.\n* **Workspace Access Tokens** can connect to a single workspace and have access to any projects and repositories within that workspace.\n\nWhen using Bitbucket APIs with an Access Token, the token will be treated as the \"user\" in the\nBitbucket UI and Bitbucket logs. This includes when using the Access Token to leave a comment on a pull request,\npush a commit, or merge a pull request. The Bitbucket UI and API responses will show the\nRepository/Project/Workspace Access Token as a user. The username shown in the Bitbucket UI is the Access\nToken _name_, and a custom icon is used to differentiate it from a regular user in the UI.\n\n#### Considerations for using Access Tokens\n\n* After creation, an Access Token can't be viewed or modified. The token's name, created date,\nlast accessed date, and scopes are visible on the repository, project, or workspace **Access Tokens** page.\n* Access Tokens can access a limited set of Bitbucket's permission scopes.\n* Provided you set the correct permission scopes, you can use an Access Token to clone (`repository`)\nand push (`repository:write`) code to the token's repository or the repositories the token can access.\n* You can't use an Access Token to log into the Bitbucket website.\n* Access Tokens don't require two-step verification.\n* You can set permission scopes (specific access rights) for each Access Token.\n* You can't use an Access Token to manipulate or query repository, project, or workspace permissions.\n* Access Tokens are not listed in any repository or workspace permission API response.\n* Access Tokens are deactivated when deleting the resource tied to it (a repository, project, or workspace).\nRepository Access Tokens are also revoked when transferring the repository to another workspace.\n* Any content created by the Access Token will persist after the Access Token has been revoked.\n* Access Tokens can interact with branch restriction APIs, but the token can't be configured as a user with merge access when using branch restrictions.\n\nThere are some APIs which are inaccessible for Access Tokens, these are:\n\n* [Add a repository deploy key](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-deployments/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-deploy-keys-post)\n* [Update a repository deploy key](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-deployments/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-deploy-keys-key-id-put)\n* [Delete a repository deploy key](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-deployments/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-deploy-keys-key-id-delete)\n\n#### Repository Access Tokens\n\nFor details on creating, managing, and using Repository Access Tokens, visit\n[Repository Access Tokens](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/repository-access-tokens/).\n\nThe available scopes for Repository Access Tokens are:\n\n- [`repository`](#repository)\n- [`repository:write`](#repository-write)\n- [`repository:admin`](#repository-admin)\n- [`repository:delete`](#repository-delete)\n- [`pullrequest`](#pullrequest)\n- [`pullrequest:write`](#pullrequest-write)\n- [`webhook`](#webhook)\n- [`pipeline`](#pipeline)\n- [`pipeline:write`](#pipeline-write)\n- [`pipeline:variable`](#pipeline-variable)\n- [`runner`](#runner)\n- [`runner:write`](#runner-write)\n\n#### Project Access Tokens\n\nFor details on creating, managing, and using Project Access Tokens, visit\n[Project Access Tokens](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/project-access-tokens/).\n\nThe available scopes for Project Access Tokens are:\n\n- [`project`](#project)\n- [`repository`](#repository)\n- [`repository:write`](#repository-write)\n- [`repository:admin`](#repository-admin)\n- [`repository:delete`](#repository-delete)\n- [`pullrequest`](#pullrequest)\n- [`pullrequest:write`](#pullrequest-write)\n- [`webhook`](#webhook)\n- [`pipeline`](#pipeline)\n- [`pipeline:write`](#pipeline-write)\n- [`pipeline:variable`](#pipeline-variable)\n- [`runner`](#runner)\n- [`runner:write`](#runner-write)\n\n#### Workspace Access Tokens\n\nFor details on creating, managing, and using Workspace Access Tokens, visit\n[Workspace Access Tokens](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/workspace-access-tokens/).\n\nThe available scopes for Workspace Access Tokens are:\n\n- [`project`](#project)\n- [`project:admin`](#project-admin)\n- [`repository`](#repository)\n- [`repository:write`](#repository-write)\n- [`repository:admin`](#repository-admin)\n- [`repository:delete`](#repository-delete)\n- [`pullrequest`](#pullrequest)\n- [`pullrequest:write`](#pullrequest-write)\n- [`webhook`](#webhook)\n- [`account`](#account)\n- [`pipeline`](#pipeline)\n- [`pipeline:write`](#pipeline-write)\n- [`pipeline:variable`](#pipeline-variable)\n- [`runner`](#runner)\n- [`runner:write`](#runner-write)\n\n### App passwords\n\nApp passwords allow users to make API calls to their Bitbucket account through apps such as Sourcetree.\n\nSome important points about app passwords:\n\n* You cannot view an app password or adjust permissions after you create the app password. Because app passwords are encrypted on our database and cannot be viewed by anyone. They are essentially designed to be disposable. If you need to change the scopes or lost the password just create a new one.\n* You cannot use them to log into your Bitbucket account.\n* You cannot use app passwords to manage team actions.\n\n    App passwords are tied to an individual account's credentials and should not be shared. If you're sharing your app password you're essentially giving direct, authenticated, access to everything that password has been scoped to do with the Bitbucket API's.\n\n* You can use them for API call authentication, even if you don't have two-step verification enabled.\n* You can set permission scopes (specific access rights) for each app password.\n\nFor details on creating, managing, and using App passwords, visit\n[App passwords](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-passwords/).\n",

In principle, every element in an object's JSON document schema can be used as a filter criterion.\n\nNote that while the array of objects in a paginated response is wrapped in an\nenvelope with a `values` element, this prefix should not be included in the\nquery fields (so use `/2.0/repositories/foo/bar/issues?q=state=\"new\"`, not\n`/2.0/repositories/foo/bar/issues?q=values.state=\"new\"`).\n\n\n### Examples\n\nFields that contain embedded instances of other object types (e.g. owner is an embedded user object, while parent is an embedded repository) can be traversed recursively. For instance:\n\n\tparent.owner.nickname = \"bitbucket\"\n\nTo find pull requests which merge into master, come from a fork of the repo rather than a branch inside the repo, and on which I am a reviewer:\n\n```\nsource.repository.full_name != \"main/repo\" AND state = \"OPEN\" AND reviewers.nickname = \"evzijst\" AND destination.branch.name = \"master\"\n```\n```\n/2.0/repositories/main/repo/pullrequests?q=source.repository.full_name+%21%3D+%22main%2Frepo%22+AND+state+%3D+%22OPEN%22+AND+reviewers.nickname+%3D+%22evzijst%22+AND+destination.branch.name+%3D+%22master%22\n```\n\nTo find new or on-hold issues related to the UI, created or updated in the last day (SF local time), that have not yet been assigned to anyone:\n\n```\n(state = \"new\" OR state = \"on hold\") AND assignee = null AND component = \"UI\" and updated_on > 2015-11-11T00:00:00-07:00\n```\n```\n/2.0/repositories/main/repo/issues?q=%28state+%3D+%22new%22+OR+state+%3D+%22on+hold%22%29+AND+assignee+%3D+null+AND+component+%3D+%22UI%22+and+updated_on+%3E+2015-11-11T00%3A00%3A00-07%3A00\n```\n\nTo find all tags with the string \"2015\" in the name:\n\n```\nname ~ \"2015\"\n```\n```\n/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/tags?q=name+%7E+%222015%22\n```\nOr all my branches:\n\n```\nname ~ \"erik/\"\n```\n```\n/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/?q=name+%7E+%22erik%2F%22\n```\n### Sorting query results\n\nYou can sort result sets using the ?sort=<field> query parameter, available on the same resources that support filtering:\n\n* In principle, every field that can be queried can also be used as a key for sorting.\n* By default the sort order is ascending. To reverse the order, prefix the field name with a hyphen (e.g. ?sort=-updated_on).\n* Only one field can be sorted on. Compound fields (e.g. sort on state first, followed by updated_on) are not supported.\n\n\n",

        "body": "\nEndpoints that return collections of objects should always apply pagination.\nPaginated collections are always wrapped in the following wrapper object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"size\": 5421,\n  \"page\": 2,\n  \"pagelen\": 10,\n  \"next\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/pypy/pypy/commits?page=3\",\n  \"previous\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/pypy/pypy/commits?page=1\",\n  \"values\": [\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nPagination is often page-bound, with a query parameter page indicating which\npage is to be returned.\n\nHowever, clients are not expected to construct URLs themselves by manipulating\nthe page number query parameter. Instead, the response contains a link to the\nnext page. This link should be treated as an opaque location that is not to be\nconstructed by clients or even assumed to be predictable. The only contract\naround the next link is that it will return the next chunk of results.\n\nLack of a next link in the response indicates the end of the collection.\n\nThe paginated response contains the following fields:\n\n| Field      | Value    |\n|------------|----------|\n| `size`     | Total number of objects in the response. This is an optional element that is not provided in all responses, as it can be expensive to compute. |\n| `page`     | Page number of the current results. This is an optional element that is not provided in all responses. |\n| `pagelen`  | Current number of objects on the existing page. Globally, the minimum length is 10 and the maximum is 100. Some APIs may specify a different default. |\n| `next`     | Link to the next page if it exists. The last page of a collection does not have this value. Use this link to navigate the result set and refrain from constructing your own URLs. |\n| `previous` | Link to previous page if it exists. A collections first page does not have this value. This is an optional element that is not provided in all responses. Some result sets strictly support forward navigation and never provide previous links. Clients must anticipate that backwards navigation is not always available. Use this link to navigate the result set and refrain from constructing your own URLs. |\n| `values`   | The list of objects. This contains at most `pagelen` objects. |\n\nThe link to the next page is included such that you don't have to hardcode or construct any links.  Only values and next are guaranteed (except the last page, which lacks next). This is because the previous and size values can be expensive for some data sets.\n\nIt is important to realize that Bitbucket support both list-based pagination and iterator-based pagination. List-based pagination assumes that the collection is a discrete, immutable, consistently ordered, finite array of objects with a fixed size. Clients navigate a list-based collection by requesting offset-based chunks. In Bitbucket Cloud, list-based responses include the optional size, page, and previous element. The the next and previous links typically resemble something like /foo/bar?page=4.\n\nHowever, not all result sets can be treated as immutable and finite – much like how programming languages tend to distinguish between lists and arrays on one hand and iterators or stream on the other. Where an list-based pagination offers random access into any point in a collection, iterator-based pagination can only navigate forward one element at a time. In Bitbucket such iterator-based pagination contains the next link and pagelen elements, but not necessarily anything else. In these cases, the next link's value often contains an unpredictable hash instead of an explicit page number. The commits resource uses iterator-based pagination.\n",

        "anchor": "partial-response",
        "body": "\nBy default, each endpoint returns the full representation of a resource and in\nsome cases that can be a lot of data. For example, retrieving a list of pull\nrequests can amount to quite a large document.\n\nFor better performance, you can ask the server to only return the fields you\nreally need and to omit unwanted data. To request a partial response and to\nadd or remove specific fields from a response, use the `fields` query\nparameter.\n\n\n### Example\n\nMost API resources embed a substantial list of links pointing to related\nresources. This saves the client from constructing its own URLs, but is\nsomewhat wasteful when the client doesn't need them.\n\nTo significantly reduce the size of the response, use `?fields=-links`:\n\n```json\n$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/evzijst?fields=-links\n{\n  \"nickname\": \"evzijst\",\n  \"account_status\": \"active\",\n  \"website\": \"\",\n  \"display_name\": \"Erik van Zijst\",\n  \"uuid\": \"{a288a0ab-e13b-43f0-a689-c4ef0a249875}\",\n  \"created_on\": \"2010-07-07T05:16:36+00:00\",\n  \"location\": null,\n  \"type\": \"user\"\n}\n```\n\n### Fields parameter syntax\n\nThe `fields` parameter supports 3 modes of operation:\n\n1. Removal of select fields (e.g. `-links`)\n2. Pulling in additional fields not normally returned by an endpoint, while\n   still getting all the default fields (e.g. `+reviewers`)\n3. Omitting all fields, except those specified (e.g. `owner.display_name`)\n\nThe fields parameter can contain a list of multiple comma-separated field names\n(e.g. `fields=owner.display_name,uuid,links.self.href`). The parameter itself is\nnot repeated.\n\nAs discussed at [Condensed Versus Full Objects](serialization#representations),\nmost objects that are embedded inside other objects (like how `owner` is an\nembedded `user` object in `repository`) appear in \"condensed\" form that omits\nmany fields. The `fields` parameter allows us to pull in additional fields in\nsuch cases.\n\nFor example, the embedded repository object in a pull request does not normally\ncontain its `owner`. To add that in we can use:\n`+values.destination.repository.owner`.\n\n\n### Wildcards\n\nThe asterisk can be used to match all fields on a particular level. For\nexample, removing all entries from the `links` element can be done like this:\n\n```json\n$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/evzijst?fields=-links.*\n{\n  \"nickname\": \"evzijst\",\n  \"account_status\": \"active\",\n  \"website\": \"\",\n  \"display_name\": \"Erik van Zijst\",\n  \"uuid\": \"{a288a0ab-e13b-43f0-a689-c4ef0a249875}\",\n  \"links\": {},\n  \"created_on\": \"2010-07-07T05:16:36+00:00\",\n  \"location\": null,\n  \"type\": \"user\"\n}\n```\n\nWildcards can be used in combination with exclusion and inclusion. For\ninstance, `-*,+foo,+bar` will remove all elements from the root level and then\nadd in `foo` and `bar`.\n\n\n### URL encoding\n\nBe aware that when using the `+foo.bar` syntax in the query string, that the\n\"+\" must be URL encoded as \"%2B\" and so the URL will be:\n\n```\nhttps://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/interruptingcow?fields=%2Bowner.created_on\n```\n\nWithout URL escaping, \"+\" is interpreted as an encoded space which will not\nmatch any fields.\n\n\n### Field discovery\n\nWhile a resource's `self` URL, as well its \"collection\" URL typically return\nthe full object with all its fields, there are some exceptions for fields that\nare overly verbose or costly to generate.\n\nFor instance, a pull request contains the embedded lists of reviewers and\nparticipants. These fields are included from the `self` URL, but not from the\n`/pullrequests` collections resource, as it would impact performance too much.\n\nTo discover any additional fields that might not be included by default,\n`fields=*` can be used.\n\n\n### More examples\n\nIf we want to get a list of all reviewer nicknames on pull requests I created,\nwe could combine a [filter](filtering) with a partial response.

Our OAI specification schema\nis hosted at [https://api.bitbucket.org/swagger.json](https://api.bitbucket.org/swagger.json)\nand serves as the canonical definition and comprehensive declaration of all\navailable endpoints.\n\nThe OAI specification makes writing client applications easier by:\nauto-generating boilerplate code (like data object classes) and dealing with\nauthentication and error handling.\n\nYou can find a comprehensive set of open tools for the OAI specification at:\n[https://github.com/swagger-api](https://github.com/swagger-api).\n\n\n### JSON Schema\n\nBitbucket uses JSON Schema to describe the layout of every type of object\nconsumed or produced by the API. These schemas are collected under the\n`#definitions` element of our swagger.json file.\n\nWhen an endpoint expects an object as part of a POST or PUT, it also expects\nthe object to validate against the JSON schemas. The same applies to objects\nreturned by an endpoint.\n\n\n### Condensed Versus Full Objects\n\nMost objects in Bitbucket come both in \"full\" and \"partial\" representation.\nThe full representation is when all elements are included. This is the layout\nreturned by a resource's `self` location (e.g. `/2.0/repositories/foo/bar`),\nas well as resource collection endpoints (e.g. `/2.0/repositories`).\n\nHowever, Bitbucket objects often embed other objects. For example, a `repository`\nobject embeds a `user` object for its owner. Likewise, a `pullrequest` object\nembeds its `repository` object.\n\nThese related objects are embedded, or inlined, to reduce the \"chatter\" when\nclients make frequent followup API calls to collect information on common,\nrelated information.\n\nEmbedded related objects are typically limited in their fields to avoid such\nobject graphs from becoming too deep and noisy. They often exclude their own\nnested objects in an attempt to strike a balance between performance and\nutility.\n\nAn object's embedded or condensed representation tends to be standardized,\nmeaning the fields included is the same set, regardless of where the object\nwas embedded.\n",

        "body": "\nYou should be familiar with REST architecture before writing an integration. Read this overview page to gain a good understanding of Bitbucket's REST implementation.\n\n----\n\n* [URI structure](#uri-structure)\n* [HTTP methods](#http-methods)\n* [UUID](#universally-unique-identifier)\n    * [User object and UUID](#user-object-and-uuid)\n    * [Repository object and UUID](#repository-object-and-uuid)\n    * [Team object and UUID](#team-object-and-uuid)\n* [Standard error responses](#standardized-error-responses)\n* [Standard ISO-8601 timestamps](#standard-iso-8601-timestamps)\n\n----\n\n\n### URI structure\n\nAll Bitbucket Cloud requests start with the `https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0` prefix (for the 2.0 API) and `https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0` prefix (1.0 API).\n\nThe next segment of the URI path depends on the endpoint of the request. For example, using the curl command and the repositories endpoint you can list all the issues on Bitbucket's tutorial repository:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/tutorials/tutorials.bitbucket.org\n```\nGiven a specific endpoint, you can then drill down to a particular aspect or resource of that endpoint. The issues resource on a repository is an example:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/repositories/tutorials/tutorials.bitbucket.org/issues\n```\n\n#### HTTP methods\n\nA given endpoint or resource has a series of actions (or methods) associated with it. The Bitbucket service supports these standard HTTP methods:\n\n| Call | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| GET    | Retrieves information. |\n| PUT    | Updates existing information. |\n| POST   | Creates new information. |\n| DELETE | Removes existing information. |\n\nFor example, you can call use the POST action on the issues resource and create an issue on the issue tracker.\n\n**Specifying content length**\n\nYou can get a `411 Length Required` response. If this happens, the API requires a Content-Length header but the client is not sending it. You should add the header yourself, for example using the curl client:\n\n```\ncurl -r PUT --header \"Content-Length: 0\" -u user:app_password https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/emails/rap@atlassian.com\n```\n\n### Universally Unique Identifier\n\nUUID's provide a single point of recognition for users, teams, and repositories. The UUID is distinct from the username, team name, and repository name fields and remains the same even when those fields change. For example when a user changes their username or moves a repository you will need to modify calls which use those identifiers but not if you are pointing to the UUID.\n\n#### UUID examples and structure\n\nUUID's work with both the 1.0 and 2.0 APIs for the user, team, and repository objects. The following examples the following characters are replacements for curly brackets: `%7B` replaces `{`  and `%7D` replaces `}`. You will see this structure in the following example sections.\n\n#### User object and UUID\n\nWhen you make a call using either the username or the UUID for that user the response is the same.\n\n**Call with username**:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials\n```\n\n***Call with UUID for the user**:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7Bc788b2da-b7a2-404c-9e26-d3f077557007%7D\n```\n\n**Response**\n```JSON\n{\n    \"username\": \"tutorials\",\n    \"nickname\": \"tutorials\",\n    \"account_status\": \"active\",\n    \"website\": \"https://tutorials.bitbucket.org/\",\n    \"display_name\": \"tutorials account\",\n    \"uuid\": \"{c788b2da-b7a2-404c-9e26-d3f077557007}\",\n    \"links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials\"\n        },\n        \"repositories\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/tutorials\"\n        },\n        \"html\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/tutorials\"\n        },\n        \"followers\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials/followers\"\n        },\n        \"avatar\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://bitbucket-assetroot.s3.amazonaws.com/c/photos/2013/Nov/25/tutorials-avatar-1563784409-6_avatar.png\"\n        },\n        \"following\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials/following\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"created_on\": \"2011-12-20T16:34:07.132459+00:00\",\n    \"location\": \"Santa Monica, CA\",\n    \"type\": \"user\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Repository object and UUID\n\nOnce you have the UUID for a repository you no longer need a username or team name to make the API call so long as you use an empty field. This helps you resolve repositories no matter if the username or team name changes.\n\n**Call with team name (1team) and repository name (moxie)**:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/1team/moxie\n```\n**Call with UUID and empty field**:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/%7B%7D/%7B21fa9bf8-b5b2-4891-97ed-d590bad0f871%7D\n```\n\n**Call with UUID and teamname**:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/1team/%7B21fa9bf8-b5b2-4891-97ed-d590bad0f871%7D\n```\n\n**Response**\n\n```JSON\n{\n    \"created_on\": \"2013-11-08T01:11:03.222520+00:00\",\n    \"description\": \"\",\n    \"fork_policy\": \"allow_forks\",\n    \"full_name\": \"1team/moxie\",\n    \"has_issues\": false,\n    \"has_wiki\": false,\n    \"is_private\": false,\n    \"language\": \"\",\n    \"links\": {\n        \"avatar\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/1team/moxie/avatar/32/\"\n        },\n        \"branches\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/1team/moxie/refs/branches\"\n        },\n        \"clone\": [\n            {\n                \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/1team/moxie.git\",\n                \"name\": \"https\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"href\": \"ssh://git@bitbucket.org/1team/moxie.git\",\n                \"name\": \"ssh\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"commits\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/1team/moxie/commits\"\n        },\n        \"downloads\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/1team/moxie/downloads\"\n        },\n        \"forks\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/1team/moxie/forks\"\n        },\n        \"hooks\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/1team/moxie/hooks\"\n        },\n        \"html\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/1team/moxie\"\n        },\n        \"pullrequests\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/1team/moxie/pullrequests\"\n        },\n        \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/1team/moxie\"\n        },\n        \"tags\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/1team/moxie/refs/tags\"\n        },\n        \"watchers\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/1team/moxie/watchers\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"name\": \"moxie\",\n    \"owner\": {\n        \"display_name\": \"the team\",\n        \"links\": {\n            \"avatar\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/account/1team/avatar/32/\"\n            },\n            \"html\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/1team/\"\n            },\n            \"self\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/1team\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"type\": \"team\",\n        \"username\": \"1team\",\n        \"uuid\": \"{aa559944-83c9-4963-a9a8-69ac8d9cf5d2}\"\n    },\n    \"project\": {\n        \"key\": \"PROJ\",\n        \"links\": {\n            \"avatar\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/account/user/1team/projects/PROJ/avatar/32\"\n            },\n            \"html\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/account/user/1team/projects/PROJ\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"name\": \"Untitled project\",\n        \"type\": \"project\",\n        \"uuid\": \"{ab52aaeb-16ad-4fb0-bb1d-47e4f00367ff}\"\n    },\n    \"scm\": \"git\",\n    \"size\": 33348,\n    \"type\": \"repository\",\n    \"updated_on\": \"2013-11-08T01:11:03.263237+00:00\",\n    \"uuid\": \"{21fa9bf8-b5b2-4891-97ed-d590bad0f871}\",\n    \"website\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Team object and UUID\n\nThis example shows a call for a list of team members using both the team name and with the UUID for the team object. As the call is unauthenticated in the following example the response object will only show members with public profiles. The response is the same in either case.\n\n**Call with teamname**\n\n```\ncurl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/1team/members\n```\n**Call with UUID for team object**\n\n```\ncurl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/%7Baa559944-83c9-4963-a9a8-69ac8d9cf5d2%7D/members\n```\n\n**Response**\n\n```JSON\n{\n    \"page\": 1,\n    \"pagelen\": 50,\n    \"size\": 2,\n    \"values\": [\n        {\n            \"created_on\": \"2011-12-20T16:34:07.132459+00:00\",\n            \"display_name\": \"tutorials account\",\n            \"links\": {\n                \"avatar\": {\n                    \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/account/tutorials/avatar/32/\"\n                },\n                \"followers\": {\n                    \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials/followers\"\n                },\n                \"following\": {\n                    \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials/following\"\n                },\n                \"hooks\": {\n                    \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials/hooks\"\n                },\n                \"html\": {\n                    \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/\"\n                },\n                \"repositories\": {\n                    \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/tutorials\"\n                },\n                \"self\": {\n                    \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials\"\n                },\n                \"snippets\": {\n                    \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/tutorials\"\n                }\n            },\n            \"location\": null,\n            \"type\": \"user\",\n            \"username\": \"tutorials\",\n            \"nickname\": \"tutorials\",\n            \"account_status\": \"active\",\n            \"uuid\": \"{c788b2da-b7a2-404c-9e26-d3f077557007}\",\n            \"website\": \"https://tutorials.bitbucket.org/\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"created_on\": \"2013-12-10T14:44:13+00:00\",\n            \"display_name\": \"Dan Stevens [Atlassian]\",\n            \"links\": {\n                \"avatar\": {\n                    \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/account/dans9190/avatar/32/\"\n                },\n                \"followers\": {\n                    \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/dans9190/followers\"\n                },\n                \"following\": {\n                    \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/dans9190/following\"\n                },\n                \"hooks\": {\n                    \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/dans9190/hooks\"\n                },\n                \"html\": {\n                    \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/dans9190/\"\n                },\n                \"repositories\": {\n                    \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/dans9190\"\n                },\n                \"self\": {\n                    \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/dans9190\"\n                },\n                \"snippets\": {\n                    \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/dans9190\"\n                }\n            },\n            \"location\": null,\n            \"type\": \"user\",\n            \"username\": \"dans9190\",\n            \"nickname\": \"dans9190\",\n            \"account_status\": \"active\",\n            \"uuid\": \"{1cd06601-cd0e-4fce-be03-e9ac226978b7}\",\n            \"website\": \"\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Standardized error responses\n\nThe 2.0 API standardizes the error response layout. The 2.0 API serves a JSON\nobject along with the appropriate HTTP status code. The JSON object provides a\ndetailed  problem description.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"error\",\n    \"error\": {\n        \"message\": \"Bad request\",\n        \"fields\": {\n            \"src\": [\n                \"This field is required.\"\n            ]\n        },\n        \"detail\": \"You must specify a valid source branch when creating a pull request.\",\n        \"id\": \"d23a1cc5178f7637f3d9bf2d13824258\",\n        \"data\": {\n          \"extra\": \"Optional, endpoint-specific data to further augment the error.\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis object contains an error element which contains the following nested\nelements:\n\n| Element | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| message | A short description of the problem. This element is always present. Its value may be localized. |\n| fields  | This optional element is used in response to POST or PUT operations in which clients have provided invalid input. It contains a list of one or more client-provided fields that failed validation. The values may be localized. |\n| detail  | An optional detailed explanation of the failure. Its value may be localized.\n| id      | An optional unique error identifier that identifies the error in Bitbucket's logging system. If you feel you hit a bug in an API and this field is provided, please mention it if you decide to contact support as it will greatly help us narrow down the problem. |\n\n### Standard ISO-8601 timestamps\n\nAll 2.0 APIs use standardized ISO-8601 timestamps. In most cases, our APIs return UTC timestamps and for these, the timezone offset part will be 00:00. In rare cases where the original localized timestamp has significance, the timezone offset may identify the event's original timezone.\n",

This applies both to responses from the server and to the request bodies provided by the client.\n\nUnless documented otherwise, whenever creating a new (POST) or modifying an existing (PUT) object, your client must provide the object's normal representation. Not every object element can be mutated. For example, a repository's created_on date is an auto-generated, immutable field. Your client can omit immutable fields from a request body.\n\nIn some cases, a resource might also accept regular application/x-www-url-form-encoded POST and PUT bodies. Such bodies can be more convenient in scripts and command line usage. Requests bodies can contain contain nested elements or they can be flat (without nested elements). Clients can send flat request bodies as either as application/json or as application/x-www-url-form-encoded. Nested objects always require JSON.\n\n### Resource links\n\nEvery 2.0 object contains a links element that points to related resources or alternate representations. Use links to quickly discover and traverse to related objects. Links serve a \"self-documenting\" function for each endpoint. For example, the following request for a specific user:\n\n\n`$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials`\n\n```json\n{\n    \"username\": \"tutorials\",\n    \"nickname\": \"tutorials\",\n    \"account_status\": \"active\",\n    \"website\": \"https://tutorials.bitbucket.org/\",\n    \"display_name\": \"tutorials account\",\n    \"uuid\": \"{c788b2da-b7a2-404c-9e26-d3f077557007}\",\n    \"links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials\"\n        },\n        \"repositories\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/tutorials\"\n        },\n        \"html\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/tutorials\"\n        },\n        \"followers\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials/followers\"\n        },\n        \"avatar\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://bitbucket-assetroot.s3.amazonaws.com/c/photos/2013/Nov/25/tutorials-avatar-1563784409-6_avatar.png\"\n        },\n        \"following\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials/following\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"created_on\": \"2011-12-20T16:34:07.132459+00:00\",\n    \"location\": \"Santa Monica, CA\",\n    \"type\": \"user\"\n}\n```\nLinks can be actual REST API resources or they can be informational. In this example, informative resources include the user's avatar and the HTML URL for the user's Bitbucket account. Your client should avoid hardcoding an API's URL and instead use the URLs returned in API responses.\n\nA link's key is its `rel` (relationship) attribute and it contains a mandatory href element. For example, the following link:\n\n```json\n\"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/api/2.0/users/tutorials\"\n}\n```\n\nThe rel for this link is self and the href is https://api.bitbucket.org/api/2.0/users/tutorials. A single rel key can contain an list (array) of href objects. Your client should anticipate that any rel key can contain one or more href objects.\n\nFinally, links can also contain optional elements. Two common optional elements are the name element and the title element. They are often used to disambiguate links that share the same rel key. In the example below, the repository object that contains a clone link with two href objects.
