    This is the official API documentation for the Public Hetzner Cloud.

    ## Introduction

    The Hetzner Cloud API operates over HTTPS and uses JSON as its data format. The API is a RESTful API and utilizes HTTP methods and HTTP status codes to specify requests and responses.

    As an alternative to working directly with our API you may also consider to use:
    * Our CLI program [hcloud](https://github.com/hetznercloud/cli)
    * Our [library for Go](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-go)
    * Our [library for Python](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-python)

    Also you can find a [list of libraries, tools, and integrations on GitHub](https://github.com/hetznercloud/awesome-hcloud).

    If you are developing integrations based on our API and your product is Open Source you may be eligible for a free one time €50 (excl. VAT) credit on your account. Please contact us via the the support page on your Cloud Console and let us know the following:
    * The type of integration you would like to develop
    * Link to the GitHub repo you will use for the Project
    * Link to some other Open Source work you have already done (if you have done so)

    ## Getting Started
    To get started using the API you first need an API token. Sign in into the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) choose a Project, go to `Security` → `API Tokens`, and generate a new token. Make sure to copy the token because it won’t be shown to you again. A token is bound to a Project, to interact with the API of another Project you have to create a new token inside the Project. Let’s say your new token is `jEheVytlAoFl7F8MqUQ7jAo2hOXASztX`.

    You’re now ready to do your first request against the API. To get a list of all Servers in your Project, issue the example request on the right side using [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/).

    Make sure to replace the token in the example command with the token you have just created. Since your Project probably does not contain any Servers yet, the example response will look like the response on the right side. We will almost always provide a resource root like `servers` inside the example response. A response can also contain a `meta` object with information like [Pagination](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#overview-pagination).

    **Example Request**
    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer jEheVytlAoFl7F8MqUQ7jAo2hOXASztX" \
        https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/servers
    ```

    **Example Response**
    ```json
    {
        "servers": [],
        "meta": {
            "pagination": {
                "page": 1,
                "per_page": 25,
                "previous_page": null,
                "next_page": null,
                "last_page": 1,
                "total_entries": 0
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    ## Authentication
    All requests to the Hetzner Cloud API must be authenticated via a API token. Include your secret API token in every request you send to the API with the `Authorization` HTTP header.

    To create a new API token for your Project, switch into the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) choose a Project, go to `Security` → `API Tokens`, and generate a new token.

    **Example Authorization header**
    ```html
    Authorization: Bearer LRK9DAWQ1ZAEFSrCNEEzLCUwhYX1U3g7wMg4dTlkkDC96fyDuyJ39nVbVjCKSDfj
    ```

    ## Errors
    Errors are indicated by HTTP status codes. Further, the response of the request which generated the error contains an error code, an error message, and, optionally, error details. The schema of the error details object depends on the error code.

    The error response contains the following keys:

    | Keys      | Meaning                                                               |
    |-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `code`    | Short string indicating the type of error (machine-parsable)          |
    | `message` | Textual description on what has gone wrong                            |
    | `details` | An object providing for details on the error (schema depends on code) |

    **Example response**
    ```json
    {
      "error": {
        "code": "invalid_input",
        "message": "invalid input in field 'broken_field': is too long",
        "details": {
          "fields": [
            {
              "name": "broken_field",

            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }

          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    ## Labels
    Labels are `key/value` pairs that can be attached to all resources.

    Valid label keys have two segments: an optional prefix and name, separated by a slash (`/`). The name segment is required and must be a string of 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`) with dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics between. The prefix is optional. If specified, the prefix must be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated by dots (`.`), not longer than 253 characters in total, followed by a slash (`/`).

    Valid label values must be a string of 63 characters or less and must be empty or begin and end with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`) with dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics between.

    The `hetzner.cloud/` prefix is reserved and cannot be used.

    **Example Labels**
    ```json
    {
      "labels": {
        "environment":"development",
        "service":"backend",
        "example.com/my":"label",
        "just-a-key":""
      }
    }
    ```

    ## Label Selector
    For resources with labels, you can filter resources by their labels using the label selector query language.

    | Expression           | Meaning                                                             |
    |----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `k==v` / `k=v`       | Value of key `k` does equal value `v`                               |
    | `k!=v`               | Value of key `k` does not equal value `v`                           |
    | `k`                  | Key `k` is present                                                  |
    | `!k`                 | Key `k` is not present                                              |
    | `k in (v1,v2,v3)`    | Value of key `k` is `v1`, `v2`, or `v3`                             |
    | `k notin (v1,v2,v3)` | Value of key `k` is neither `v1`, nor `v2`, nor `v3`                |
    | `k1==v,!k2`          | Value of key `k1` is `v` and key `k2` is not present                |

    ### Examples
    * Returns all resources that have a `env=production` label and that don't have a `type=database` label:

      `env=production,type!=database`
    * Returns all resources that have a `env=testing` or `env=staging` label:

        `env in (testing,staging)`
    * Returns all resources that don't have a `type` label:

        `!type`

    ## Pagination
    Responses which return multiple items support pagination. If they do support pagination, it can be controlled with following query string parameters:

    * A `page` parameter specifies the page to fetch. The number of the first page is 1.
    * A `per_page` parameter specifies the number of items returned per page. The default value is 25, the maximum value is 50 except otherwise specified in the documentation.

    Responses contain a `Link` header with pagination information.

    Additionally, if the response body is JSON and the root object is an object, that object has a `pagination` object inside the `meta` object with pagination information:

    **Example Pagination**
    ```json
    {
        "servers": [...],
        "meta": {
            "pagination": {
                "page": 2,
                "per_page": 25,
                "previous_page": 1,
                "next_page": 3,
                "last_page": 4,
                "total_entries": 100
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    The keys `previous_page`, `next_page`, `last_page`, and `total_entries` may be `null` when on the first page, last page, or when the total number of entries is unknown.

    **Example Pagination Link header**
    ```bash
    Link: <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=2&per_page=5>; rel="prev",
          <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=4&per_page=5>; rel="next",
          <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=6&per_page=5>; rel="last"
    ```

    Line breaks have been added for display purposes only and responses may only contain some of the above `rel` values.

    ## Rate Limiting
    All requests, whether they are authenticated or not, are subject to rate limiting. If you have reached your limit, your requests will be handled with a `429 Too Many Requests` error. Burst requests are allowed. Responses contain serveral headers which provide information about your current rate limit status.

    * The `RateLimit-Limit` header contains the total number of requests you can perform per hour.
    * The `RateLimit-Remaining` header contains the number of requests remaining in the current rate limit time frame.
    * The `RateLimit-Reset` header contains a UNIX timestamp of the point in time when your rate limit will have recovered and you will have the full number of requests available again.

    The default limit is 3600 requests per hour and per Project. The number of remaining requests increases gradually. For example, when your limit is 3600 requests per hour, the number of remaining requests will increase by 1 every second.

    ## Server Metadata
    Your Server can discover metadata about itself by doing a HTTP request to specific URLs. The following data is available:

    | Data              | Format | Contents                                                     |
    |-------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
    | hostname          | text   | Name of the Server as set in the api                         |
    | instance-id       | number | ID of the server                                             |
    | public-ipv4       | text   | Primary public IPv4 address                                  |
    | private-networks  | yaml   | Details about the private networks the Server is attached to |
    | availability-zone | text   | Name of the availability zone that Server runs in            |
    | region            | text   | Network zone, e.g. eu-central                                |

    **Example: Summary**
    ```bash
    $ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata
    ```

    ```yaml
    availability-zone: hel1-dc2
    hostname: my-server

    ```bash
    $ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/region
    eu-central
    ```

    ## Sorting
    Some responses which return multiple items support sorting. If they do support sorting the documentation states which fields can be used for sorting. You specify sorting with the `sort` query string parameter. You can sort by multiple fields. You can set the sort direction by appending `:asc` or `:desc` to the field name. By default, ascending sorting is used.

    **Example: Sorting**
    ```bash
    https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status
    https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:asc
    https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:desc
    https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:asc&sort=command:desc

      Each Datacenter represents a *virtual* Datacenter which is made up of possible many physical Datacenters where Servers are hosted.

      Datacenter names are composed from their Location and virtual Datacenter number, for example `fsn1-dc14` means virtual Datacenter `14` in Location `fsn1`.

      Right now there is only one Datacenter for each Location. The Datacenter numbers for `fsn`, `nbg` and `hel` are arbitrarily set to `14`, `3` and `2` for historic reasons and do not represent real physical Hetzner datacenters.

      Firewalls can limit the network access to or from your resources.

      * When applying a firewall with no `in` rule all inbound traffic will be dropped. The default for `in` is `DROP`.
      * When applying a firewall with no `out` rule all outbound traffic will be accepted. The default for `out` is `ACCEPT`.

      Floating IPs help you to create highly available setups. You can assign a Floating IP to any Server. The Server can then use this IP. You can reassign it to a different Server at any time, or you can choose to unassign the IP from Servers all together.

      Floating IPs can be used globally. This means you can assign a Floating IP to a Server in one Location and later reassign it to a Server in a different Location. For optimal routing and latency Floating IPs should be used in the Location they were created in.

      For Floating IPs to work with your Server, you must configure them inside your operation system.

      Floating IPs of type `ipv4` use a single IPv4 address as their `ip` property. Floating IPs of type `ipv6` use a /64 network such as `fc00::/64` as their `ip` property. Any IP address within that network can be used on your host.

      Floating IPs are billed on a monthly basis.

      Images are blueprints for your VM disks. They can be of different types:

      ### System Images
      Distribution Images maintained by us, e.g. “Ubuntu 20.04”

      ### Snapshot Images
      Maintained by you, for example “Ubuntu 20.04 with my own settings”. These are billed per GB per month.

      ### Backup Images
      Daily Backups of your Server. Will automatically be created for Servers which have backups enabled (`POST /servers/{id}/actions/enable_backup`)

      Bound to exactly one Server. If you delete the Server, you also delete all backups bound to it. You may convert backup Images to snapshot Images to keep them.

      These are billed at 20% of your instance price for 7 backup slots.

      ### App Images
      Prebuild images with specific software configurations, e.g. “Wordpress”. All app images are created by us.

      ISOs are read-only Images of DVDs. While we recommend using our Image functionality to install your Servers we also provide some stock ISOs so you can install more exotic operating systems by yourself.

      On request our support uploads a private ISO just for you. These are marked with type `private` and only visible in your Project.

      To attach an ISO to your Server use `POST /servers/{id}/actions/attach_iso`.

      Primary IPs help you to create more flexible networking setups. You can assign at most one Primary IP of type `ipv4` and one of type `ipv6` per Server. This Server then uses these IPs.

      You can only unassign a Primary IP from a Server when it's powered off. This Primary IP can then be assigned to a different powered off Server, or you can keep it around for later use.

      Primary IPs are bound to a specific Datacenter. You can not assign a Primary IP from one Datacenter to a Server in a different Datacenter. If you need this capability use Floating IPs instead.

      If your Server's operating system supports cloud-init there is no further configuration needed to make Primary IPs work.

      Primary IPs of type `ipv4` use a single IPv4 address as their `ip` property. Primary IPs of type `ipv6` use a /64 network such as `fc00::/64` as their `ip` property. Any IP address within that network can be used on your host.

      Primary IPs are billed on an hourly basis.

      Networks is a private networks feature. These Networks are optional and they coexist with the public network that every Server has by default.

      They allow Servers to talk to each other over a dedicated network interface using private IP addresses not available publicly.

      The IP addresses are allocated and managed via the API, they must conform to [RFC1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918#section-3) standard. IPs and network interfaces defined under Networks do not provide public internet connectivity, you will need to use the already existing public network interface for that.

      Each network has a user selected `ip_range` which defines all available IP addresses which can be used for Subnets within the Network.

      To assign individual IPs to Servers you will need to create Network Subnets, described below.

      Currently Networks support IPv4 only.

      ### Subnets
      Subnets divide the `ip_range` from the parent Network object into multiple Subnetworks that you can use for different specific purposes.

      For each subnet you need to specify its own `ip_range` which must be contained within the parent Network’s `ip_range`. Additionally each subnet must belong to one of the available Network Zones described below. Subnets can not have overlapping IP ranges.

      Currently there are three types of subnet:
      * type `cloud` is used to connect cloud Resources into your Network.
      * type `server` was used to connect only cloud Servers into your Network. This type is deprecated and is replaced by type cloud.
      * type `vswitch` allows you to connect [Dedicated Server vSwitch](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/network/vswitch) - and all Dedicated Servers attached to it - into your Network

      Subnets of type `vswitch` must set a `vswitch_id` which is the ID of the existing vSwitch in Hetzner Robot that should be coupled.

      ### Network Zones
      Network Zones are groups of Locations which have special high-speed network connections between them. The [Location object](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#locations-get-a-location) contains the `network_zone` property each Location belongs to. Currently these network zones exist:

      |Network Zone|Contains Locations|
      |------------|------------------|
      |eu-central  | nbg1, fsn1, hel1 |
      |us-east     | ash              |

      ### IP address management
      When a cloud Server is attached to a network without the user specifying an IP it automatically gets an IP address assigned from a subnet of type `server` in the same network zone. If you specify the optional `ip` parameter when attaching then we will try to assign that IP. Keep in mind that the Server’s location must be covered by the Subnet’s Network Zone if you specify an IP, or that at least one Subnet with the zone covering Server’s location must exist.

      A cloud Server can also have more than one IP address in a Network by specifying aliases. For details see the [attach to network action](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#server-actions-attach-a-server-to-a-network).

      The following IP addresses are reserved in networks and can not be used:
        * the first IP of the network `ip_range` as it will be used as a default gateway for the private Network interface.
        * `172.31.1.1` as it is being used as default gateway for our public Network interfaces.

      ### Coupling Dedicated Servers

      By using subnets of type `vswitch` you can couple the Cloud Networks with an existing [Dedicated Server vSwitch](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/network/vswitch) and enable dedicated and cloud servers to
      talk to each other over the Network.
      In order for this to work the dedicated servers may only use IPs from the subnet and must have a special network configuration. Please refer to [FAQ](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/networks/connect-dedi-vswitch). vSwitch Layer 2 features are not supported.

      ### Routes
      Networks also support the notion of routes which are automatically applied to private traffic. A route makes sure that all packets for a given `destination` IP prefix will be sent to the address specified in its `gateway`.

      Placement groups are used to influence the location of interdependent virtual servers in our data centers. The distribution of the different instances within a group is based on a pattern specified in the type. By enforcing certain rules on the placement of instances within our infrastructure, availability can be influenced in a way that fits your needs best.

      In `spread` placement groups, all virtual servers will run on different physical servers. This decreases the probability that some instances might fail together.

        Creates a new Certificate.

        The default type **uploaded** allows for uploading your existing `certificate` and `private_key` in PEM format. You have to monitor its expiration date and handle renewal yourself.

        In contrast, type **managed** requests a new Certificate from *Let's Encrypt* for the specified `domain_names`. Only domains managed by *Hetzner DNS* are supported. We handle renewal and timely alert the project owner via email if problems occur.

        For type `managed` Certificates the `action` key of the response contains the Action that allows for tracking the issuance process. For type `uploaded` Certificates the `action` is always null.

        Updates the Certificate properties.

        Note that when updating labels, the Certificate’s current set of labels will be replaced with the labels provided in the request body. So, for example, if you want to add a new label, you have to provide all existing labels plus the new label in the request body.

        Note: if the Certificate object changes during the request, the response will be a “conflict” error.

        Note that when updating labels, the Firewall's current set of labels will be replaced with the labels provided in the request body. So, for example, if you want to add a new label, you have to provide all existing labels plus the new label in the request body.

        Note: if the Firewall object changes during the request, the response will be a “conflict” error.

      description: Creates a new Floating IP assigned to a Server. If you want to create a Floating IP that is not bound to a Server, you need to provide the `home_location` key instead of `server`. This can be either the ID or the name of the Location this IP shall be created in. Note that a Floating IP can be assigned to a Server in any Location later on. For optimal routing it is advised to use the Floating IP in the same Location it was created in.

        Updates a Load Balancer. You can update a Load Balancer’s name and a Load Balancer’s labels.

        Note that when updating labels, the Load Balancer’s current set of labels will be replaced with the labels provided in the request body. So, for example, if you want to add a new label, you have to provide all existing labels plus the new label in the request body.

        Note: if the Load Balancer object changes during the request, the response will be a “conflict” error.

        You must specify the type of metric to get: `open_connections`, `connections_per_second`, `requests_per_second` or `bandwidth`. You can also specify more than one type by comma separation, e.g. `requests_per_second,bandwidth`.

        Depending on the type you will get different time series data:

        |Type | Timeseries | Unit | Description |
        |---- |------------|------|-------------|
        | open_connections | open_connections | number | Open connections |
        | connections_per_second | connections_per_second | connections/s | Connections per second |
        | requests_per_second | requests_per_second | requests/s | Requests per second |
        | bandwidth | bandwidth.in | bytes/s | Ingress bandwidth |
        || bandwidth.out | bytes/s | Egress bandwidth |

        Metrics are available for the last 30 days only.

        If you do not provide the step argument we will automatically adjust it so that 200 samples are returned.

        We limit the number of samples to a maximum of 500 and will adjust the step parameter accordingly.

        Creates a network with the specified `ip_range`.

        You may specify one or more `subnets`. You can also add more Subnets later by using the [add subnet action](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#network-actions-add-a-subnet-to-a-network). If you do not specify an `ip_range` in the subnet we will automatically pick the first available /24 range for you.

        You may specify one or more routes in `routes`. You can also add more routes later by using the [add route action](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#network-actions-add-a-route-to-a-network).

    post:
      description: |
        Changes the IP range of a Network. IP ranges can only be extended and never shrunk. You can only add IPs at the end of an existing IP range. This means that the IP part of your existing range must stay the same and you can only change its netmask.

        For example if you have a range `10.0.0.0/16` you want to extend then your new range must also start with the IP `10.0.0.0`. Your CIDR netmask `/16` may change to a number that is smaller than `16` thereby increasing the IP range. So valid entries would be `10.0.0.0/15`, `10.0.0.0/14`, `10.0.0.0/13` and so on.

        After changing the IP range you will have to adjust the routes on your connected Servers by either rebooting them or manually changing the routes to your private Network interface.

        Note: if the Network object changes during the request, the response will be a “conflict” error.

        Updates the PlacementGroup properties.

        Note that when updating labels, the PlacementGroup’s current set of labels will be replaced with the labels provided in the request body. So, for example, if you want to add a new label, you have to provide all existing labels plus the new label in the request body.

        Note: if the PlacementGroup object changes during the request, the response will be a “conflict” error.

        Creates a new Primary IP, optionally assigned to a Server.

        If you want to create a Primary IP that is not assigned to a Server, you need to provide the `datacenter` key instead of `assignee_id`. This can be either the ID or the name of the Datacenter this Primary IP shall be created in.

        Note that a Primary IP can only be assigned to a Server in the same Datacenter later on.

        Updates the Primary IP.

        Note that when updating labels, the Primary IP's current set of labels will be replaced with the labels provided in the request body. So, for example, if you want to add a new label, you have to provide all existing labels plus the new label in the request body.

        If the Primary IP object changes during the request, the response will be a “conflict” error.

        Assigns a Primary IP to a Server.

        A Server can only have one Primary IP of type `ipv4` and one of type `ipv6` assigned. If you need more IPs use Floating IPs.

        The Server must be powered off (status `off`) in order for this operation to succeed.

          Please note that Server names must be unique per Project and valid hostnames as per RFC 1123 (i.e. may only contain letters, digits, periods, and dashes).

          For `server_type` you can either use the ID as listed in `/server_types` or its name.

          For `image` you can either use the ID as listed in `/images` or its name.

          If you want to create the Server in a Location, you must set `location` to the ID or name as listed in `/locations`. This is the recommended way. You can be even more specific by setting `datacenter` to the ID or name as listed in `/datacenters`. However we only recommend this if you want to assign a specific Primary IP to the Server which is located in the specified Datacenter.

          Some properties like `start_after_create` or `automount` will trigger Actions after the Server is created. Those Actions are listed in the `next_actions` field in the response.

          For accessing your Server we strongly recommend to use SSH keys by passing the respective key IDs in `ssh_keys`. If you do not specify any `ssh_keys` we will generate a root password for you and return it in the response.

          Please note that provided user-data is stored in our systems. While we take measures to protect it we highly recommend that you don’t use it to store passwords or other sensitive information.

        Updates a Server. You can update a Server’s name and a Server’s labels.
        Please note that Server names must be unique per Project and valid hostnames as per RFC 1123 (i.e. may only contain letters, digits, periods, and dashes).
        Also note that when updating labels, the Server’s current set of labels will be replaced with the labels provided in the request body. So, for example, if you want to add a new label, you have to provide all existing labels plus the new label in the request body.

        Attaches a Server to a network. This will complement the fixed public Server interface by adding an additional ethernet interface to the Server which is connected to the specified network.

        The Server will get an IP auto assigned from a subnet of type `server` in the same `network_zone`.

        Using the `alias_ips` attribute you can also define one or more additional IPs to the Servers. Please note that you will have to configure these IPs by hand on your Server since only the primary IP will be given out by DHCP.

        **Call specific error codes**

        Changes the type (Cores, RAM and disk sizes) of a Server.

        Server must be powered off for this command to succeed.

        This copies the content of its disk, and starts it again.

        You can only migrate to Server types with the same `storage_type` and equal or bigger disks. Shrinking disks is not possible as it might destroy data.

        If the disk gets upgraded, the Server type can not be downgraded any more. If you plan to downgrade the Server type, set `upgrade_disk` to `false`.

        Creates an Image (snapshot) from a Server by copying the contents of its disks. This creates a snapshot of the current state of the disk and copies it into an Image. If the Server is currently running you must make sure that its disk content is consistent. Otherwise, the created Image may not be readable.

        To make sure disk content is consistent, we recommend to shut down the Server prior to creating an Image.

        You can either create a `backup` Image that is bound to the Server and therefore will be deleted when the Server is deleted, or you can create an `snapshot` Image which is completely independent of the Server it was created from and will survive Server deletion. Backup Images are only available when the backup option is enabled for the Server. Snapshot Images are billed on a per GB basis.

        Disables the Hetzner Rescue System for a Server. This makes a Server start from its disks on next reboot.

        Rescue Mode is automatically disabled when you first boot into it or if you do not use it for 60 minutes.

        Disabling rescue mode will not reboot your Server — you will have to do this yourself.

        Enable the Hetzner Rescue System for this Server. The next time a Server with enabled rescue mode boots it will start a special minimal Linux distribution designed for repair and reinstall.

        In case a Server cannot boot on its own you can use this to access a Server’s disks.

        Rescue Mode is automatically disabled when you first boot into it or if you do not use it for 60 minutes.

        Enabling rescue mode will not [reboot](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#server-actions-soft-reboot-a-server) your Server — you will have to do this yourself.

        Rebuilds a Server overwriting its disk with the content of an Image, thereby **destroying all data** on the target Server

        The Image can either be one you have created earlier (`backup` or `snapshot` Image) or it can be a completely fresh `system` Image provided by us. You can get a list of all available Images with `GET /images`.

        You must specify the type of metric to get: cpu, disk or network. You can also specify more than one type by comma separation, e.g. cpu,disk.

        Depending on the type you will get different time series data

        Metrics are available for the last 30 days only.

        If you do not provide the step argument we will automatically adjust it so that a maximum of 200 samples are returned.

        We limit the number of samples returned to a maximum of 500 and will adjust the step parameter accordingly.

      description: |
        Creates a new Volume attached to a Server. If you want to create a Volume that is not attached to a Server, you need to provide the `location` key instead of `server`. This can be either the ID or the name of the Location this Volume will be created in. Note that a Volume can be attached to a Server only in the same Location as the Volume itself.

        Specifying the Server during Volume creation will automatically attach the Volume to that Server after it has been initialized. In that case, the `next_actions` key in the response is an array which contains a single `attach_volume` action.

        The minimum Volume size is 10GB and the maximum size is 10TB (10240GB).

        A volume’s name can consist of alphanumeric characters, dashes, underscores, and dots, but has to start and end with an alphanumeric character. The total length is limited to 64 characters. Volume names must be unique per Project.
