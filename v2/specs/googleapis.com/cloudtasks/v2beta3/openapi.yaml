      description: Forces a task to run now. When this method is called, Cloud Tasks will dispatch the task, even if the task is already running, the queue has reached its RateLimits or is PAUSED. This command is meant to be used for manual debugging. For example, RunTask can be used to retry a failed task after a fix has been made or to manually force a task to be dispatched now. The dispatched task is returned. That is, the task that is returned contains the status after the task is dispatched but before the task is received by its target. If Cloud Tasks receives a successful response from the task's target, then the task will be deleted; otherwise the task's schedule_time will be reset to the time that RunTask was called plus the retry delay specified in the queue's RetryConfig. RunTask returns NOT_FOUND when it is called on a task that has already succeeded or permanently failed.

Using AppEngineHttpRequest requires [`appengine.applications.get`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/access-control) Google IAM permission for the project and the following scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform` The task will be delivered to the App Engine app which belongs to the same project as the queue. For more information, see [How Requests are Routed](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed) and how routing is affected by [dispatch files](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/dispatchref). Traffic is encrypted during transport and never leaves Google datacenters. Because this traffic is carried over a communication mechanism internal to Google, you cannot explicitly set the protocol (for example, HTTP or HTTPS). The request to the handler, however, will appear to have used the HTTP protocol. The AppEngineRouting used to construct the URL that the task is delivered to can be set at the queue-level or task-level: * If set, app_engine_routing_override is used for all tasks in the queue, no matter what the setting is for the task-level app_engine_routing. The `url` that the task will be sent to is: * `url =` host `+` relative_uri Tasks can be dispatched to secure app handlers, unsecure app handlers, and URIs restricted with [`login: admin`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref). Because tasks are not run as any user, they cannot be dispatched to URIs restricted with [`login: required`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref) Task dispatches also do not follow redirects. The task attempt has succeeded if the app's request handler returns an HTTP response code in the range [`200` - `299`]. The task attempt has failed if the app's handler returns a non-2xx response code or Cloud Tasks does not receive response before the deadline. Failed tasks will be retried according to the retry configuration. `503` (Service Unavailable) is considered an App Engine system error instead of an application error and will cause Cloud Tasks' traffic congestion control to temporarily throttle the queue's dispatches. Unlike other types of task targets, a `429` (Too Many Requests) response from an app handler does not cause traffic congestion control to throttle the queue."

For example, `Content-Type` can be set to `"application/json"`. * `Content-Length`: This is computed by Cloud Tasks. This value is output only. It cannot be changed. The headers below cannot be set or overridden: * `Host` * `X-Google-*` * `X-AppEngine-*` In addition, Cloud Tasks sets some headers when the task is dispatched, such as headers containing information about the task; see [request headers](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/creating-appengine-handlers#reading_request_headers). These headers are set only when the task is dispatched, so they are not visible when the task is returned in a Cloud Tasks response.

The user can optionally specify a task name. If a name is not specified then the system will generate a random unique task id, which will be set in the task returned in the response. If schedule_time is not set or is in the past then Cloud Tasks will set it to the current time. Task De-duplication: Explicitly specifying a task ID enables task de-duplication. If a task's ID is identical to that of an existing task or a task that was deleted or executed recently then the call will fail with ALREADY_EXISTS. If the task's queue was created using Cloud Tasks, then another task with the same name can't be created for ~1 hour after the original task was deleted or executed. If the task's queue was created using queue.yaml or queue.xml, then another task with the same name can't be created for ~9 days after the original task was deleted or executed. Because there is an extra lookup cost to identify duplicate task names, these CreateTask calls have significantly increased latency. Using hashed strings for the task id or for the prefix of the task id is recommended. Choosing task ids that are sequential or have sequential prefixes, for example using a timestamp, causes an increase in latency and error rates in all task commands. The infrastructure relies on an approximately uniform distribution of task ids to store and serve tasks efficiently."

    Policy:
      description: "An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\", } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/)."

Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue's bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on max_dispatches_per_second.

For App Engine queues that were created or updated using `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` is equal to [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size).

For example, if the worker is stuck, it may not react to cancelled requests. The default and maximum values depend on the type of request: * For HTTP tasks, the default is 10 minutes. The deadline must be in the interval [15 seconds, 30 minutes]. * For App Engine tasks, 0 indicates that the request has the default deadline. The default deadline depends on the [scaling type](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/how-instances-are-managed#instance_scaling) of the service: 10 minutes for standard apps with automatic scaling, 24 hours for standard apps with manual and basic scaling, and 60 minutes for flex apps. If the request deadline is set, it must be in the interval [15 seconds, 24 hours 15 seconds]. Regardless of the task's `dispatch_deadline`, the app handler will not run for longer than than the service's timeout. We recommend setting the `dispatch_deadline` to at most a few seconds more than the app handler's timeout. For more information see [Timeouts](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/creating-appengine-handlers#timeouts). `dispatch_deadline` will be truncated to the nearest millisecond. The deadline is an approximate deadline."
