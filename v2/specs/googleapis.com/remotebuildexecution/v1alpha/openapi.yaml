For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. You can also filter on nested fields. To filter on multiple expressions, you can separate expression using `AND` and `OR` operators, using parentheses to specify precedence. If neither operator is specified, `AND` is assumed. Examples: Include only pools with more than 100 reserved workers: `(worker_count > 100) (worker_config.reserved = true)` Include only pools with a certain label or machines of the e2-standard family: `worker_config.labels.key1 : * OR worker_config.machine_type: e2-standard`"

    BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2Action:
      description: An `Action` captures all the information about an execution which is required to reproduce it. `Action`s are the core component of the [Execution] service. A single `Action` represents a repeatable action that can be performed by the execution service. `Action`s can be succinctly identified by the digest of their wire format encoding and, once an `Action` has been executed, will be cached in the action cache. Future requests can then use the cached result rather than needing to run afresh. When a server completes execution of an Action, it MAY choose to cache the result in the ActionCache unless `do_not_cache` is `true`. Clients SHOULD expect the server to do so. By default, future calls to Execute the same `Action` will also serve their results from the cache. Clients must take care to understand the caching behaviour. Ideally, all `Action`s will be reproducible so that serving a result from cache is always desirable and correct.
      properties:
        commandDigest:

The root directory, as well as every subdirectory and content blob referred to, MUST be in the ContentAddressableStorage.
        platform:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2Platform"
          description: "The optional platform requirements for the execution environment. The server MAY choose to execute the action on any worker satisfying the requirements, so the client SHOULD ensure that running the action on any such worker will have the same result. A detailed lexicon for this can be found in the accompanying platform.md. New in version 2.2: clients SHOULD set these platform properties as well as those in the Command. Servers SHOULD prefer those set here."
        salt:
          description: An optional additional salt value used to place this `Action` into a separate cache namespace from other instances having the same field contents. This salt typically comes from operational configuration specific to sources such as repo and service configuration, and allows disowning an entire set of ActionResults that might have been poisoned by buggy software or tool failures.

          type: string
        timeout:
          description: A timeout after which the execution should be killed. If the timeout is absent, then the client is specifying that the execution should continue as long as the server will let it. The server SHOULD impose a timeout if the client does not specify one, however, if the client does specify a timeout that is longer than the server's maximum timeout, the server MUST reject the request. The timeout is only intended to cover the "execution" of the specified action and not time in queue nor any overheads before or after execution such as marshalling inputs/outputs. The server SHOULD avoid including time spent the client doesn't have control over, and MAY extend or reduce the timeout to account for delays or speedups that occur during execution itself (e.g., lazily loading data from the Content Addressable Storage, live migration of virtual machines, emulation overhead). The timeout is a part of the Action message, and therefore two `Actions` with different timeouts are different, even if they are otherwise identical. This is because, if they were not, running an `Action` with a lower timeout than is required might result in a cache hit from an execution run with a longer timeout, hiding the fact that the timeout is too short. By encoding it directly in the `Action`, a lower timeout will result in a cache miss and the execution timeout will fail immediately, rather than whenever the cache entry gets evicted.

      description: "A content digest. A digest for a given blob consists of the size of the blob and its hash. The hash algorithm to use is defined by the server. The size is considered to be an integral part of the digest and cannot be separated. That is, even if the `hash` field is correctly specified but `size_bytes` is not, the server MUST reject the request. The reason for including the size in the digest is as follows: in a great many cases, the server needs to know the size of the blob it is about to work with prior to starting an operation with it, such as flattening Merkle tree structures or streaming it to a worker. Technically, the server could implement a separate metadata store, but this results in a significantly more complicated implementation as opposed to having the client specify the size up-front (or storing the size along with the digest in every message where digests are embedded). This does mean that the API leaks some implementation details of (what we consider to be) a reasonable server implementation, but we consider this to be a worthwhile tradeoff. When a `Digest` is used to refer to a proto message, it always refers to the message in binary encoded form. To ensure consistent hashing, clients and servers MUST ensure that they serialize messages according to the following rules, even if there are alternate valid encodings for the same message: * Fields are serialized in tag order. * There are no unknown fields. * There are no duplicate fields. * Fields are serialized according to the default semantics for their type. Most protocol buffer implementations will always follow these rules when serializing, but care should be taken to avoid shortcuts. For instance, concatenating two messages to merge them may produce duplicate fields."

    BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2Directory:
      description: 'A `Directory` represents a directory node in a file tree, containing zero or more children FileNodes, DirectoryNodes and SymlinkNodes. Each `Node` contains its name in the directory, either the digest of its content (either a file blob or a `Directory` proto) or a symlink target, as well as possibly some metadata about the file or directory. In order to ensure that two equivalent directory trees hash to the same value, the following restrictions MUST be obeyed when constructing a a `Directory`: * Every child in the directory must have a path of exactly one segment. Multiple levels of directory hierarchy may not be collapsed. * Each child in the directory must have a unique path segment (file name). Note that while the API itself is case-sensitive, the environment where the Action is executed may or may not be case-sensitive. That is, it is legal to call the API with a Directory that has both "Foo" and "foo" as children, but the Action may be rejected by the remote system upon execution. * The files, directories and symlinks in the directory must each be sorted in lexicographical order by path. The path strings must be sorted by code point, equivalently, by UTF-8 bytes. * The NodeProperties of files, directories, and symlinks must be sorted in lexicographical order by property name. A `Directory` that obeys the restrictions is said to be in canonical form. As an example, the following could be used for a file named `bar` and a directory named `foo` with an executable file named `baz` (hashes shortened for readability): ```json // (Directory proto) { files: [ { name: "bar", digest: { hash: "4a73bc9d03...", size: 65534 }, node_properties: [ { "name": "MTime", "value": "2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z" } ] } ], directories: [ { name: "foo", digest: { hash: "4cf2eda940...", size: 43 } } ] } // (Directory proto with hash "4cf2eda940..." and size 43) { files: [ { name: "baz", digest: { hash: "b2c941073e...", size: 1294, }, is_executable: true } ] } ```'

        isTopologicallySorted:
          description: "If set, consumers MAY make the following assumptions about the directories contained in the the Tree, so that it may be instantiated on a local file system by scanning through it sequentially: - All directories with the same binary representation are stored exactly once. - All directories, apart from the root directory, are referenced by at least one parent directory. - Directories are stored in topological order, with parents being stored before the child. The root directory is thus the first to be stored. Additionally, the Tree MUST be encoded as a stream of records, where each record has the following format: - A tag byte, having one of the following two values: - (1 << 3) | 2 == 0x0a: First record (the root directory). - (2 << 3) | 2 == 0x12: Any subsequent records (child directories). - The size of the directory, encoded as a base 128 varint. - The contents of the directory, encoded as a binary serialized Protobuf message. This encoding is a subset of the Protobuf wire format of the Tree message. As it is only permitted to store data associated with field numbers 1 and 2, the tag MUST be encoded as a single byte. More details on the Protobuf wire format can be found here: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding It is recommended that implementations using this feature construct Tree objects manually using the specification given above, as opposed to using a Protobuf library to marshal a full Tree message. As individual Directory messages already need to be marshaled to compute their digests, constructing the Tree object manually avoids redundant marshaling."

If an unknown `name` is provided in the requirements for an Action, the server SHOULD reject the execution request. If permitted by the server, the same `name` may occur multiple times. The server is also responsible for specifying the interpretation of property `value`s. For instance, a property describing how much RAM must be available may be interpreted as allowing a worker with 16GB to fulfill a request for 8GB, while a property describing the OS environment on which the action must be performed may require an exact match with the worker's OS. The server MAY use the `value` of one or more properties to determine how it sets up the execution environment, such as by making specific system files available to the worker. Both names and values are typically case-sensitive. Note that the platform is implicitly part of the action digest, so even tiny changes in the names or values (like changing case) may result in different action cache entries.

Note: the gRPC library serializes binary headers encoded in base 64 by default (https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md#requests). Therefore, if the gRPC library is used to pass/retrieve this metadata, the user may ignore the base64 encoding and assume it is simply serialized as a binary message."
