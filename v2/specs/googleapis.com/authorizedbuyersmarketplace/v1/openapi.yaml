If you want to opt out of the default behavior, and manually indicate that deals are ready to serve, ask your Technical Account Manager to add you to the allowlist. If you choose to use this method, finalized deals belonging to the bidder and its child seats don't start serving until after you call `setReadyToServe`, and after the deals become active. For example, you can use this method to delay receiving bid requests until your creative is ready. This method only applies to programmatic guaranteed deals.

The buyer of the API is expected to keep track of the revision number after the last update operation and send it in as part of the next update request.
