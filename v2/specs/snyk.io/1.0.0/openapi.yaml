    The Snyk API is available to customers on [Business and Enterprise plans](https://snyk.io/plans) and allows you to programatically integrate with Snyk.

    ## REST API

    We are in the process of building a new, improved API (`https://api.snyk.io/rest`) built using the OpenAPI and JSON API standards. We welcome you to try it out as we shape and release endpoints until it, ultimately, becomes a full replacement for our current API.

    Looking for our REST API docs? Please head over to [https://apidocs.snyk.io](https://apidocs.snyk.io)

    ## API vs CLI vs Snyk integration

    The API detailed below has the ability to test a package for issues, as they are defined by Snyk. It is important to note that for many package managers, using this API will be less accurate than running the [Snyk CLI](https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk) as part of your build pipe, or just using it locally on your package. The reason for this is that more than one package version fit the requirements given in manifest files. Running the CLI locally tests the actual deployed code, and has an accurate snapshot of the dependency versions in use, while the API can only infer it, with inferior accuracy. It should be noted that the Snyk CLI has the ability to output machine-readable JSON output (with the `--json` flag to `snyk test`).

    A third option, is to allow Snyk access to your development flow via the existing [Snyk integrations](https://snyk.io/docs/). The advantage to this approach is having Snyk monitor every new pull request, and suggest fixes by opening new pull requests. This can be achieved either by integrating Snyk directly to your source code management (SCM) tool, or via a broker to allow greater security and auditability.

    If those are not viable options, this API is your best choice.

    ## API url

    The base URL for all API endpoints is https://api.snyk.io/api/v1/

    ## Authorization

    To use this API, you must get your token from Snyk. It can be seen on https://snyk.io/account/ after you register with Snyk and login.

    The token should be supplied in an `Authorization` header with the token, preceded by `token`:

    ```http
    Authorization: token API_KEY
    ```

    Otherwise, a 401 "Unauthorized" response will be returned.

    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized

            {
                "code": 401,
                "error": "Not authorised",
                "message": "Not authorised"
            }
    ```

    ## Overview and entities

    The API is a REST API. It has the following entities:

Provided in markdown format. | "## Overview\n[`org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22log4j-core%22)\nIn Apache Log4j 2.x before 2.8.2, when using the TCP socket server or UDP socket server to receive serialized log events from another application, a specially crafted binary payload can be sent that, when deserialized, can execute arbitrary code.\n\n# Details\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution. \n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\n- Apache Blog\n\n\n## References\n- [NVD](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-5645)\n- [jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-1863)\n" |

    #### Patch

    A patch is an object like this one:

    ```json
    {
      "urls": [
        "https://snyk-patches.s3.amazonaws.com/npm/backbone/20110701/backbone_20110701_0_0_0cdc525961d3fa98e810ffae6bcc8e3838e36d93.patch"
      ],
      "version": "<0.5.0 >=0.3.3",
      "modificationTime": "2015-11-06T02:09:36.180Z",
      "comments": [
        "https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/commit/0cdc525961d3fa98e810ffae6bcc8e3838e36d93.patch"
      ],
      "id": "patch:npm:backbone:20110701:0"
    }
    ```

    ### From and upgrade paths

    Both from and upgrade paths are arrays, where each item within the array is a package `name@version`.

    Take the following `from` path:

    ```
    [
      "my-project@1.0.0",
      "actionpack@4.2.5",
      "rack@1.6.4"
    ]
    ```

    Assuming this was returned as a result of a test, then we know:

    - The package that was tested was `my-project@1.0.0`

    - The dependency with an issue was included in the tested package via the direct dependency `actionpack@4.2.5`

    - The dependency with an issue was [rack@1.6.4](https://snyk.io/vuln/rubygems:rack@1.6.4)

    Take the following `upgrade` path:

    ```
    [
      false,
      "actionpack@5.0.0",
      "rack@2.0.1"
    ]
    ```

    Assuming this was returned as a result of a test, then we know:

    - The package that was tested is not upgradable (`false`)

    - The direct dependency `actionpack` should be upgraded to at least version `5.0.0` in order to fix the issue

    - Upgrading `actionpack` to version `5.0.0` will cause `rack` to be installed at version `2.0.1`

    If the `upgrade` path comes back as an empty array (`[]`) then this means that there is no upgrade path available which would fix the issue.

    ### License issue

    A license issue has no additional fields other than the ones in "Issue".

    ### Snyk organization

    The organization in Snyk this request is applicable to. The organization determines the access rights, licenses policy and is the unit of billing for private projects.

    A Snyk organization has these fields:

    Property    | Type   | Description                   | Example                                |
    -----------:| ------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
    name        | string | The organization display name | "deelmaker"                            |
    id          | string | The ID of the organization    | "3ab0f8d3-b17d-4953-ab6d-e1cbfe1df385" |

    ## Errors

    This is a beta release of this API. Therefore, despite our efforts, errors might occur. In the unlikely event of such an error, it will have the following structure as JSON in the body:

    Property    | Type   | Description                   | Example                                |
    -----------:| ------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
    message     | string | Error message with reference  | Error calling Snyk api (reference: 39db46b1-ad57-47e6-a87d-e34f6968030b) |
    errorRef    | V4 uuid | An error ref to contact Snyk with | 39db46b1-ad57-47e6-a87d-e34f6968030b |

    The error reference will also be supplied in the `x-error-reference` header in the server reply.

    Example response:

    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
    x-error-reference: a45ec9c1-065b-4f7b-baf8-dbd1552ffc9f
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Content-Length: 1848
    Vary: Accept-Encoding
    Date: Sun, 10 Sep 2017 06:48:40 GMT
    ```

    ## Rate Limiting

    To ensure resilience against increasing request rates, we are starting to introduce rate-limiting.
    We are monitoring the rate-limiting system to ensure minimal impact on users while ensuring system stability.
    Current limit is up to 2000 requests per minute, per user. This limit is above industry standards, and is subject to change. As such, we recommend calls to the API are throttled regardless of the current limit.
    All requests above the limit will get a response with status code `429` - `Too many requests` until requests stop for the duration of the rate-limiting interval (currently a minute).

    ## Consuming Webhooks

    Webhooks are delivered with a `Content-Type` of `application/json`, with the event payload as JSON in the request body. We also send the following headers:

    - `X-Snyk-Event` - the name of the event

    - `X-Snyk-Transport-ID` - a GUID to identify this delivery

    - `X-Snyk-Timestamp` - an ISO 8601 timestamp for when the event occurred, for example: `2020-09-25T15:27:53Z`

    - `X-Hub-Signature` - the HMAC hex digest of the request body, used to secure your webhooks and ensure the request did indeed come from Snyk

    - `User-Agent` - identifies the origin of the request, for example: `Snyk-Webhooks/XXX`

    ---

    After your server is configured to receive payloads, it listens for any payload sent to the endpoint you configured. For security reasons, you should limit requests to those coming from Snyk.

    ### Validating payloads

    All transports sent to your webhooks have a `X-Hub-Signature` header, which contains the hash signature for the transport. The signature is a HMAC hexdigest of the request body, generated using sha256 and your `secret` as the HMAC key.

    You could use a function in Node.JS such as the following to validate these signatures on incoming requests from Snyk:

    ```javascript
    import * as crypto from 'crypto';

    function verifySignature(request, secret) {
      const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);
      const buffer = JSON.stringify(request.body);
      hmac.update(buffer, 'utf8');

      const signature = `sha256=${hmac.digest('hex')}`;

      return signature === request.headers['x-hub-signature'];
    }
    ```

    ### Payload versioning

    Payloads may evolve over time, and so are versioned. Payload versions are supplied as a suffix to the `X-Snyk-Event` header. For example, `project_snapshot/v0` indicates that the payload is `v0` of the `project_snapshot` event.

    Version numbers only increment when a breaking change is made; for example, removing a field that used to exist, or changing the name of a field. Version numbers do not increment when making an additive change, such as adding a new field that never existed before.

    **Note:** During the BETA phase, the structure of webhook payloads may change at any time, so we  recommend you check the payload version.

    ### Event types

    While consuming a webhook event, `X-Snyk-Event` header must be checked, as an end-point may receive multiple event types.

    #### ping

    The ping event happens after a new webhook is created, and can also be manually triggered using the ping webhook API. This is useful to test that your webhook receives data from Snyk correctly.

    The `ping` event makes the following request:

    ```jsx
    POST /webhook-handler/snyk123 HTTP/1.1
    Host: my.app.com
    X-Snyk-Event: ping/v0
    X-Snyk-Transport-ID: 998fe884-18a0-45db-8ae0-e379eea3bc0a
    X-Snyk-Timestamp: 2020-09-25T15:27:53Z
    X-Hub-Signature: sha256=7d38cdd689735b008b3c702edd92eea23791c5f6
    User-Agent: Snyk-Webhooks/044aadd
    Content-Type: application/json
    {
      "webhookId": "d3cf26b3-2d77-497b-bce2-23b33cc15362"
    }
    ```

    #### project_snapshot

    This event is triggered every time an existing project is tested and a new snapshot is created. It is triggered on every test of a project, whether or not there are new issues. This event is not triggered when a new project is created or imported. Currently supported targets/scan types are Open Source and container.

    ```jsx
    POST /webhook-handler/snyk123 HTTP/1.1
    Host: my.app.com
    X-Snyk-Event: project_snapshot/v0
    X-Snyk-Transport-ID: 998fe884-18a0-45db-8ae0-e379eea3bc0a
    X-Snyk-Timestamp: 2020-09-25T15:27:53Z
    X-Hub-Signature: sha256=7d38cdd689735b008b3c702edd92eea23791c5f6
    User-Agent: Snyk-Webhooks/044aadd
    Content-Type: application/json
    {
      "project": { ... }, // project object matching API responses
      "org": { ... }, // organization object matching API responses
      "group": { ... }, // group object matching API responses
      "newIssues": [], // array of issues object matching API responses
      "removedIssues": [], // array of issues object matching API responses
    }
    ```

      ## Intro

      > Warning: the webhooks feature is currently in beta. While in this status, we may change the API and the structure of webhook payloads at any time, without notice.

      Webhooks allow you to be notified of events taking place in the Snyk system and react to changes in your projects.

      Webhooks associate an event type with a URL. When something triggers that event type, Snyk sends an HTTP POST request to the URL with a payload containing information about the event. Currently supported targets/scan types are Open Source and container.

      ## Who can access this feature?

      Only Business and Enterprise customers.

      ## Configuring webhooks

      Webhooks can be configured using our API at organization level, by organization admins.

        Applies an attribute to the provided project.
        It is possible to assign multiple values to each attribute, but you can only assign values to one of the predefined attribute categories, using the predefined options for this category.
        Assigning an attribute requires the caller to be either an Organization Administrator or a Group Administrator.
        Assigning an attribute will override any existing values that the specific attribute already has set.
        In order to clear out an attribute value, an empty array can be set.

                            ## Overview
                              Affected versions of [`aws/aws-sdk-php`](https://packagist.org/packages/aws/aws-sdk-php) are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution.

                            Doctrine Annotations before 1.2.7, Cache before 1.3.2 and 1.4.x before 1.4.2, Common before 2.4.3 and 2.5.x before 2.5.1, ORM before 2.4.8 or 2.5.x before 2.5.1, MongoDB ODM before 1.0.2, and MongoDB ODM Bundle before 3.0.1 use world-writable permissions for cache directories, which allows local users to execute arbitrary PHP code with additional privileges by leveraging an application with the umask set to 0 and that executes cache entries as code.

                            ## Remediation
                            Upgrade `aws/aws-sdk-php` to version 3.2.1 or higher.

                            ## Overview
                            Affected versions of [`doctrine/common`](https://packagist.org/packages/doctrine/common) are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution.

                            Doctrine Annotations before 1.2.7, Cache before 1.3.2 and 1.4.x before 1.4.2, Common before 2.4.3 and 2.5.x before 2.5.1, ORM before 2.4.8 or 2.5.x before 2.5.1, MongoDB ODM before 1.0.2, and MongoDB ODM Bundle before 3.0.1 use world-writable permissions for cache directories, which allows local users to execute arbitrary PHP code with additional privileges by leveraging an application with the umask set to 0 and that executes cache entries as code.

                            ## Remediation
                            Upgrade `doctrine/common` to version 2.5.1, 2.4.3 or higher.

                            [symfony/symfony](https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/symfony) is a PHP framework for web applications and a set of reusable PHP components.



                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS).

                            A remote attacker could inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the \"file\" parameter in a URL.


                            ## Details

                            A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\r

                            \r

                            This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\r

                            \r

                            ֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\r

                            \r

                            Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\r

                            \ \r

                            The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \r

                            \r

                            ### Types of attacks\r

                            There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\r

                            \r

                            |Type|Origin|Description|\r

                            |--|--|--|\r

                            |**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\r

                            |**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \r

                            |**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\r

                            |**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\r

                            \r

                            ### Affected environments\r

                            The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\r

                            \r

                            * Web servers\r

                            * Application servers\r

                            * Web application environments\r

                            \r

                            ### How to prevent\r

                            This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \r

                            \r

                            * Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \r

                            * Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \r

                            * Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\r

                            * Redirect invalid requests.\r

                            * Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\r

                            * Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\r

                            * Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.


                            ## Remediation


                            Upgrade `symfony/symfony` to version 4.1 or higher.

                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Host Header Injection.
                            When using `HttpCache`, the values of the `X-Forwarded-Host` headers are implicitly set as trusted while this should be forbidden, leading to potential host header injection.

                            ## Remediation

                            Upgrade `symfony/symfony` to version 2.7.49, 2.8.44, 3.3.18, 3.4.14, 4.0.14, 4.1.2 or higher.

The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\r

                            \r

                            ֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\r

                            \r

                            Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\r

                            \ \r

                            The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \r

                            \r

                            ### Types of attacks\r

                            There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\r

                            \r

                            |Type|Origin|Description|\r

                            |--|--|--|\r

                            |**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\r

                            |**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \r

                            |**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\r

                            |**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\r

                            \r

                            ### Affected environments\r

                            The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\r

                            \r

                            * Web servers\r

                            * Application servers\r

                            * Web application environments\r

                            \r

                            ### How to prevent\r

                            This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \r

                            \r

                            * Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \r

                            * Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \r

                            * Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\r

                            * Redirect invalid requests.\r

                            * Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\r

                            * Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\r

                            * Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.


                            ## Remediation


                            Upgrade `symfony/symfony` to version 2.7.7 or higher.

                            ## Overview
                            Affected versions of [`symfony/symfony`](https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/symfony) are vulnerable to Loss of Information.

                            When using the Validator component, if Symfony\\Component\\Validator\\Mapping\\Cache\\ApcCache is enabled (or any other cache implementing Symfony\\Component\\Validator\\Mapping\\Cache\\CacheInterface), some information is lost during serialization (the collectionCascaded and the collectionCascadedDeeply fields).

                            ## Remediation
                            Upgrade `symfony/symfony` to version 2.3.3, 2.1.12, 2.2.5, 2.0.24 or higher.

                            Affected versions of [`symfony/symfony`](https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/symfony) are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS).


                            The Security component in Symfony 2.0.x before 2.0.25, 2.1.x before 2.1.13, 2.2.x before 2.2.9, and 2.3.x before 2.3.6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a long password that triggers an expensive hash computation, as demonstrated by a PBKDF2 computation, a similar issue to [CVE-2013-5750](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PHP-FRIENDSOFSYMFONYUSERBUNDLE-70102).


                            ## Details

                            Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\r

                            \r

                            Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\r

                            \r

                            One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\r

                            \r

                            When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\r

                            \r

                            Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\r

                            \r

                            * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\r

                            \r

                            * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)


                            ## Remediation

                            Upgrade `symfony/symfony` to version 2.3.6, 2.1.13, 2.2.9, 2.0.25 or higher.

                            Affected versions of [`symfony/symfony`](https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/symfony) are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS).


                            ## Details

                            Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\r

                            \r

                            Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\r

                            \r

                            One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\r

                            \r

                            When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\r

                            \r

                            Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\r

                            \r

                            * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\r

                            \r

                            * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)


                            ## Remediation

                            Upgrade `symfony/symfony` to version 2.3.19, 2.4.9, 2.5.4 or higher.

                            Affected versions of [`symfony/symfony`](https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/symfony) are vulnerable to Information Exposure.

                            When you enable the ESI feature and when you are using a proxy like Varnish that you configured as a trusted proxy, the FragmentHandler considered requests to render fragments as coming from a trusted source, even if the client was requesting them directly. Symfony can not distinguish between ESI requests done on behalf of the client by Varnish and faked fragment requests coming directly from the client.

                            ## Remediation
                            Upgrade `symfony/symfony` to version 2.3.19, 2.2.0, 2.4.9, 2.5.4, 2.3.0, 2.1.0 or higher.

                            ## Overview
                            Affected versions of [`symfony/symfony`](https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/symfony) are vulnerable to Authentication Bypass.

                            When an application uses an HTTP basic or digest authentication, Symfony does not parse the Authorization header properly, which could be exploited in some server setups (no exploits have been demonstrated though.)

                            ## Remediation
                            Upgrade `symfony/symfony` to version 2.3.19, 2.2.0, 2.4.9, 2.5.4, 2.3.0, 2.1.0 or higher.

                            ## Overview
                            Affected versions of [`symfony/symfony`](https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/symfony) are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Injection.

                            Eval injection vulnerability in the HttpCache class in HttpKernel in Symfony 2.x before 2.3.27, 2.4.x and 2.5.x before 2.5.11, and 2.6.x before 2.6.6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a `language="php"` attribute of a SCRIPT element.

                            ## Remediation
                            Upgrade `symfony/symfony` to version 2.3.27, 2.6.6, 2.2.0, 2.5.0, 2.5.11, 2.3.0, 2.1.0 or higher.

                            ## Overview
                            Affected versions of [`symfony/symfony`](https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/symfony) are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM).

                            The `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request` class provides a mechanism that ensures it does not trust HTTP header values coming from a "non-trusted" client. Unfortunately, it assumes that the remote address is always a trusted client if at least one trusted proxy is involved in the request; this allows a man-in-the-middle attack between the latest trusted proxy and the web server.

                            ## Remediation
                            Upgrade `symfony/symfony` to version 2.3.27, 2.5.11, 2.6.6 or higher.

                            Symfony 2.3.x before 2.3.35, 2.6.x before 2.6.12, and 2.7.x before 2.7.7 might allow remote attackers to have unspecified impact via a timing attack involving:
                            * Symfony/Component/Security/Http/RememberMe/PersistentTokenBasedRememberMeServices or
                            * Symfony/Component/Security/Http/Firewall/DigestAuthenticationListener class in the Symfony Security Component, or
                            * legacy CSRF implementation from the Symfony/Component/Form/Extension/Csrf/CsrfProvider/DefaultCsrfProvider class in the Symfony Form component.

                            ## Remediation
                            Upgrade `symfony/symfony` to version 2.3.35, 2.6.12, 2.5.0, 2.7.7, 2.6.0 or higher.

                            ## Overview
                            Affected versions of [`symfony/symfony`](https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/symfony) are vulnerable to Insecure Randomness .

                            The nextBytes function in the SecureRandom class in Symfony before 2.3.37, 2.6.x before 2.6.13, and 2.7.x before 2.7.9 does not properly generate random numbers when used with PHP 5.x without the paragonie/random_compat library and the openssl_random_pseudo_bytes function fails, which makes it easier for attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms via unspecified vectors.

                            ## Remediation
                            Upgrade `symfony/symfony` to version 2.3.37, 2.6.13, 2.5.0, 2.7.9, 2.6.0 or higher.

                            Affected versions of [`symfony/symfony`](https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/symfony) are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS).


                            The attemptAuthentication function in Component/Security/Http/Firewall/UsernamePasswordFormAuthenticationListener.php in Symfony before 2.3.41, 2.7.x before 2.7.13, 2.8.x before 2.8.6, and 3.0.x before 3.0.6 does not limit the length of a username stored in a session, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (session storage consumption) via a series of authentication attempts with long, non-existent usernames.


                            ## Details

                            Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\r

                            \r

                            Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\r

                            \r

                            One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\r

                            \r

                            When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\r

                            \r

                            Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\r

                            \r

                            * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\r

                            \r

                            * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)


                            ## Remediation

                            Upgrade `symfony/symfony` to version 2.3.41, 2.7.0, 2.5.0, 2.7.13, 2.6.0, 2.8.6, 3.0.6 or higher.

                            [symfony/symfony](https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/symfony) is a set of reusable PHP components.


                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks via the `PDOSessionHandler` class.


                            **An application is vulnerable when:**


                            * It uses `PDOSessionHandler` to store its sessions

                            * And it uses MySQL as a backend for sessions managed by `PDOSessionHandler`

                            * And the SQL mode does not contain `STRICT_ALL_TABLES` or `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES`.


                            With this configuration, An attacker may conduct a denial of service by a well-crafted session, which leads to an infinite loop in the code.

                            ## Overview
                            [symfony/symfony](https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/symfony) is a set of PHP components.

                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Restriction Bypass. A misconfigured LDAP server allowed unauthorized access, due to a missing check for `null` passwords.

                            **Note:** This is related to [CVE-2016-2403](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PHP-SYMFONYSYMFONY-70221).

                            ## Remediation
                            Upgrade `symfony/symfony` to versions 2.8.37, 3.3.17, 3.4.7, 4.0.7 or higher.

                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to CSRF Token Fixation. CSRF tokens where not erased during logout, when the `invalidate_session` option was disabled. By default, a user’s session is invalidated when the user is logged out.

                            ## Remediation
                            Upgrade `symfony/symfony` to versions 2.7.48, 2.8.41, 3.3.17, 3.4.11, 4.0.11 or higher.

                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect. This is due to an incomplete fix for [CVE-2017-16652](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PHP-SYMFONYSYMFONY-70381). There was an an edge case when the `security.http_utils` was inlined by the container.

                            ## Remediation
                            Upgrade `symfony/symfony` to versions 2.7.48, 2.8.41, 3.3.17, 3.4.11, 4.0.11 or higher.

                            ## Overview
                            [symfony/symfony](https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/symfony) is a set of reusable PHP components.

                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Session Fixation via the `Guard` login feature. An attacker may be able to impersonate the victim towards the web application if the session id value was previously known to the attacker. This allows the attacker to access a Symfony web application with the attacked user's permissions.

                            **Note:**
                            * The `Guard authentication` login feature must be enabled for the attack to be applicable.
                            * The attacker must have access to the `PHPSESSID` cookie value or has successfully set a new value in the user's browser.

                            ## Remediation
                            Upgrade `symfony/symfony` to versions 2.7.48, 2.8.41, 3.3.17, 3.4.11, 4.0.11 or higher.

                            [symfony/symfony](https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/symfony) is the The Symfony PHP framework.


                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks via the `ExceptionHandler.php` method.


                            ## Details

                            A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\r

                            \r

                            This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\r

                            \r

                            ֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\r

                            \r

                            Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\r

                            \ \r

                            The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \r

                            \r

                            ### Types of attacks\r

                            There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\r

                            \r

                            |Type|Origin|Description|\r

                            |--|--|--|\r

                            |**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\r

                            |**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \r

                            |**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\r

                            |**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\r

                            \r

                            ### Affected environments\r

                            The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\r

                            \r

                            * Web servers\r

                            * Application servers\r

                            * Web application environments\r

                            \r

                            ### How to prevent\r

                            This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \r

                            \r

                            * Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \r

                            * Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \r

                            * Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\r

                            * Redirect invalid requests.\r

                            * Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\r

                            * Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\r

                            * Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.



                            ## Remediation

                            Upgrade `symfony/symfony` to versions 2.7.33, 2.8.26, 3.2.13, 3.3.6 or higher.

                            ## Overview
                            Affected versions of [`yiisoft/yii`](https://packagist.org/packages/yiisoft/yii) are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution.

                            The CDetailView widget in Yii PHP Framework 1.1.14 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP scripts via vectors related to the value property.

                            ## Remediation
                            Upgrade `yiisoft/yii` to version 1.1.15 or higher.

                            Affected versions of [`zendframework/zendframework`](https://packagist.org/packages/zendframework/zendframework) are vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) Injection.


                            ## Details


                            XXE Injection is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input.\r

                            XML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing. When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.\r

                            \r

                            Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier.\r

                            \r

                            For example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element- username.\r

                            \r

                            ```xml\r

                            <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\r

                            \   <username>John</username>\r

                            </xml>\r

                            ```\r

                            \r

                            An external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML entity that would fetch the content of  `/etc/passwd` and display it to the user rendered by `username`.\r

                            \r

                            ```xml\r

                            <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\r

                            <!DOCTYPE foo [\r

                            \   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\" >]>\r

                            \   <username>&xxe;</username>\r

                            </xml>\r

                            ```\r

                            \r

                            Other XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading to Denial of Service.


                            ## Remediation

                            Upgrade `zendframework/zendframework` to version 2.1.6, 2.2.6 or higher.

                          description: "## Overview

                            Affected versions of [`zendframework/zendframework`](https://packagist.org/packages/zendframework/zendframework) are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS).


                            ## Details

                            A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\r

                            \r

                            This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\r

                            \r

                            ֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\r

                            \r

                            Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\r

                            \ \r

                            The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \r

                            \r

                            ### Types of attacks\r

                            There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\r

                            \r

                            |Type|Origin|Description|\r

                            |--|--|--|\r

                            |**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\r

                            |**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \r

                            |**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\r

                            |**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\r

                            \r

                            ### Affected environments\r

                            The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\r

                            \r

                            * Web servers\r

                            * Application servers\r

                            * Web application environments\r

                            \r

                            ### How to prevent\r

                            This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \r

                            \r

                            * Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \r

                            * Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \r

                            * Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\r

                            * Redirect invalid requests.\r

                            * Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\r

                            * Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\r

                            * Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.



                            ## Remediation

                            Upgrade `zendframework/zendframework` to version 2.3.1, 2.2.7 or higher.

                            ## Overview
                            Affected versions of [`zendframework/zendframework`](https://packagist.org/packages/zendframework/zendframework) are vulnerable to Insufficient Session Validation.

                            `Zend\Session` session validators do not work as expected if set prior to the start of a session.

                            The implication is that subsequent calls to `Zend\Session\SessionManager#start()` (in later requests, assuming a session was created) will not have any validator metadata attached, which causes any validator metadata to be re-built from scratch, thus marking the session as valid.

                            An attacker is thus able to simply ignore session validators such as `RemoteAddr` or `HttpUserAgent`, since the "signature" that these validators check against is not being stored in the session.

                            ## Remediation
                            Upgrade `zendframework/zendframework` to version 2.3.4, 2.2.9 or higher.

                            Affected versions of [`zendframework/zendframework`](https://packagist.org/packages/zendframework/zendframework) are vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) Injection.\r

                            \r

                            ## Details\r

                            \r

                            XXE Injection is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input.\r

                            XML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing. When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.\r

                            \r

                            Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier.\r

                            \r

                            For example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element- username.\r

                            \r

                            ```xml\r

                            <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\r

                            \   <username>John</username>\r

                            </xml>\r

                            ```\r

                            \r

                            An external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML entity that would fetch the content of  `/etc/passwd` and display it to the user rendered by `username`.\r

                            \r

                            ```xml\r

                            <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\r

                            <!DOCTYPE foo [\r

                            \   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\" >]>\r

                            \   <username>&xxe;</username>\r

                            </xml>\r

                            ```\r

                            \r

                            Other XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading to Denial of Service.\r

                            \r

                            ## Remediation\r

                            Upgrade `zendframework/zendframework` to version 2.4.6, 2.5.1 or higher.\r

                            \r

                            ## Overview
                            [zendframework/zendframework](https://packagist.org/packages/zendframework/zendframework) provides functionality for consuming RSS and Atom feeds.

                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary URL Rewrite. The request URI marshaling process contains logic that inspects HTTP request headers that are specific to a given server-side URL rewrite mechanism. 

                            When these headers are present on systems not running the specific URL rewriting mechanism, the URLs are subject to rewriting, allowing a malicious client or proxy to emulate the headers to request arbitrary content.

                            ## Remediation
                            Upgrade `zendframework/zendframework` to version 2.5.0 or higher.

                          [ch.qos.logback:logback-core](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/ch.qos.logback/logback-core) is a logback-core module.



                          Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution.

                          A configuration can be turned on to allow remote logging through interfaces that accept untrusted serialized data. Authenticated attackers on the adjacent network can exploit this vulnerability to run arbitrary code through the deserialization of custom gadget chains.


                          ## Details

                          Serialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\r

                          \r

                          \  \r

                          \r

                          _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\r

                          \r

                          \  \r

                          \r

                          Java deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\r

                          An attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\r

                          > Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\r

                          The vulnerability, also know as _Mad Gadget_\r

                          \r

                          > Mad Gadget is one of the most pernicious vulnerabilities we’ve seen. By merely existing on the Java classpath, seven “gadget” classes in Apache Commons Collections (versions 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.2.1, and 4.0) make object deserialization for the entire JVM process Turing complete with an exec function. Since many business applications use object deserialization to send messages across the network, it would be like hiring a bank teller who was trained to hand over all the money in the vault if asked to do so politely, and then entrusting that teller with the key. The only thing that would keep a bank safe in such a circumstance is that most people wouldn’t consider asking such a question.\r

                            [github.com/satori/go.uuid](https://github.com/satori/go.uuid) provides pure Go implementation of Universally Unique Identifier (UUID).\r

                            \r

                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Randomness producing predictable `UUID` identifiers due to the limited number of bytes read when using the `g.rand.Read` function.\r

                            \ \r

                            ## Disclosure Timeline\r

                            * Jun 3th, 2018 - The vulnerability introduced by replacing the function `rand.Read()` with the function `g.rand.Read()` (https://github.com/satori/go.uuid/commit/0ef6afb2f6cdd6cdaeee3885a95099c63f18fc8c)\r

                            * Mar 23th, 2018- An issue was reported.\r

                            * Oct 16th, 2018 Issue fixed\r

                            \r

                            ## Overview
                            Affected version of [`github.com/docker/libcontainer`](https://github.com/docker/libcontainer) are vulnerable to Symlink Attacks.
                            Libcontainer and Docker Engine before 1.6.1 opens the file-descriptor passed to the pid-1 process before performing the chroot, which allows local users to gain privileges via a symlink attack in an image.

                            \r

                            ## Details\r

                            The `getCN` function in Apache Axis 1.4 and earlier does not properly verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's `Common Name (CN)` or `subjectAltName` field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a certificate with a subject that specifies a common name in a field that is not the CN field.  \r

                            **NOTE:** this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for [CVE-2012-5784](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-AXIS-30189).

                            There is no fixed version for `axis:axis`.

                            [org.apache.flex.blazeds:blazeds](https://github.com/apache/flex-blazeds) is an application development framework for easily building Flash-based applications for mobile devices, web browsers, and desktops.



                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution.

                            The AMF deserialization implementation of Flex BlazeDS is vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data. By sending a specially crafted AMF message, it is possible to make the server establish a connection to an endpoint specified in the message and request an RMI remote object from that endpoint. This can result in the execution of arbitrary code on the server via Java deserialization.\r

                            \r

                            Starting with BlazeDS version `4.7.3`, Deserialization of XML is disabled completely per default, while the `ClassDeserializationValidator` allows deserialization of whitelisted classes only. BlazeDS internally comes with the following whitelist:\r

                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM).

                            \r

                            ## Details\r

                            The `getCN` function in Apache Axis 1.4 and earlier does not properly verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's `Common Name (CN)` or `subjectAltName` field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a certificate with a subject that specifies a common name in a field that is not the CN field.  \r

                            \r

                            **NOTE:** this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for [CVE-2012-5784](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-AXIS-30189).


                            ## Remediation


                            There is no fixed version for `axis:axis`.

                            [axis:axis](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:axis) is an implementation of the SOAP (\"Simple Object Access Protocol\") submission to W3C.



                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM).

                            It does not verify the requesting server's hostname against existing domain names in the SSL Certificate.\r

                            \r

                            ## Details\r

                            Apache Axis 1.4 and earlier does not properly verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's `Common Name (CN)` or `subjectAltName` field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.


                            ## Remediation


                            There is no fixed version for `axis:axis`.

                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS).

                            Four letter zookeeper commands (such as `wchp`/`wchc` ) are not properly handled, which leads to the server unable to serve legitimate client requests.


                            ## Details

                            Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\r

                            \r

                            Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\r

                            \r

                            One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\r

                            \r

                            When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\r

                            \r

                            Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\r

                            \r

                            * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\r

                            \r

                            * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)


                            ## Remediation


                            Upgrade `org.apache.zookeeper:zookeeper` to version 3.4.10, 3.5.3-beta or higher.

                            ## Overview

                            [org.apache.zookeeper:zookeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services.


                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication Bypass.
                            No authentication/authorization is enforced when a server attempts to join a quorum, as a result an arbitrary end point could join the cluster and begin propagating counterfeit changes to the leader.

                            ## Remediation

                            Upgrade `org.apache.zookeeper:zookeeper` to version 3.4.10, 3.5.4-beta or higher.

                            [org.apache.flex.blazeds:blazeds](https://github.com/apache/flex-blazeds) is an application development framework for easily building Flash-based applications for mobile devices, web browsers, and desktops.



                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution.

                            The AMF deserialization implementation of Flex BlazeDS is vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data. By sending a specially crafted AMF message, it is possible to make the server establish a connection to an endpoint specified in the message and request an RMI remote object from that endpoint. This can result in the execution of arbitrary code on the server via Java deserialization.\r

                            \r

                            Starting with BlazeDS version `4.7.3`, Deserialization of XML is disabled completely per default, while the `ClassDeserializationValidator` allows deserialization of whitelisted classes only. BlazeDS internally comes with the following whitelist:\r

                            ## Overview
                            [`node-uuid`](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-uuid) is a Simple, fast generation of RFC4122 UUIDS.

                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Randomness. It uses the cryptographically insecure `Math.random` which can produce predictable values and should not be used in security-sensitive context.

                            ## Remediation
                            Upgrade `node-uuid` to version 1.4.4 or greater.

                            [qs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs) is a querystring parser that supports nesting and arrays, with a depth limit.



                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (Memory Exhaustion).

                            During parsing, the `qs` module may create a sparse area (an array where no elements are filled), and grow that array to the necessary size based on the indices used on it. An attacker can specify a high index value in a query string, thus making the server allocate a respectively big array. Truly large values can cause the server to run out of memory and cause it to crash - thus enabling a Denial-of-Service attack.


                            ## Remediation


                            Upgrade `qs` to version 1.0.0 or higher.



                            ## Details

                            Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\r

                            \r

                            Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\r

                            \r

                            One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\r

                            \r

                            When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\r

                            \r

                            Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\r

                            \r

                            * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\r

                            \r

                            * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (Event Loop Blocking).

                            When parsing a string representing a deeply nested object, qs will block the event loop for long periods of time. Such a delay may hold up the server's resources, keeping it from processing other requests in the meantime, thus enabling a Denial-of-Service attack.

                            [qs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs) is a querystring parser that supports nesting and arrays, with a depth limit.



                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Override Protection Bypass.

                            By default `qs` protects against attacks that attempt to overwrite an object's existing prototype properties, such as `toString()`, `hasOwnProperty()`,etc.\r

                            \r

                            From [`qs` documentation](https://github.com/ljharb/qs):\r

                            > By default parameters that would overwrite properties on the object prototype are ignored, if you wish to keep the data from those fields either use plainObjects as mentioned above, or set allowPrototypes to true which will allow user input to overwrite those properties. WARNING It is generally a bad idea to enable this option as it can cause problems when attempting to use the properties that have been overwritten. Always be careful with this option.\r

                            \r

                            Overwriting these properties can impact application logic, potentially allowing attackers to work around security controls, modify data, make the application unstable and more.\r

                            \r

                            In versions of the package affected by this vulnerability, it is possible to circumvent this protection and overwrite prototype properties and functions by prefixing the name of the parameter with `[` or `]`. e.g. `qs.parse(\"]=toString\")` will return `{toString = true}`, as a result, calling `toString()` on the object will throw an exception.\r

                            \r

                            **Example:**\r

                            ```js\r

                            qs.parse('toString=foo', { allowPrototypes: false })\r

                            // {}\r

                            \r

                            qs.parse(\"]=toString\", { allowPrototypes: false })\r

                            // {toString = true} <== prototype overwritten\r

                            ```\r

                            \r

                            [ms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ms) is a tiny millisecond conversion utility.



                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)

                            attack when converting a time period string (i.e. `\"2 days\"`, `\"1h\"`) into a milliseconds integer. A malicious user could pass extremely long strings to `ms()`, causing the server to take a long time to process, subsequently blocking the event loop for that extended period.


                            ## Details

                            Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\r

                            \r

                            The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\r

                            \r

                            Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:\r

                            ```js\r

                            regex = /A(B|C+)+D/\r

                            ```\r

                            \r

                            This regular expression accomplishes the following:\r

                            - `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\r

                            - `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\r

                            - `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\r

                            \r

                            The expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\r

                            \r

                            It most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\r

                            \r

                            ```bash\r

                            $ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\r

                            0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\r

                            \r

                            $ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\r

                            1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\r

                            ```\r

                            \r

                            The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\r

                            \r

                            Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\r

                            \r

                            Let's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\r

                            1. CCC\r

                            2. CC+C\r

                            3. C+CC\r

                            4. C+C+C.\r

                            \r

                            The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\r

                            \r

                            From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\r

                            \r

                            | String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\r

                            | -------|-------------:| -----:|\r

                            | ACCCX | 3 | 38\r

                            | ACCCCX | 4 | 71\r

                            | ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\r

                            | ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\r

                            \r

                            \r

                            By the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.


                            ## Remediation


                            Upgrade `ms` to version 0.7.1 or higher.

                            [`supervisor`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/supervisor/) is a client/server system that allows its users to monitor and control a number of processes on UNIX-like operating systems.\r

                            \r

                            Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command Execution. A vulnerability has been found where an authenticated client can send a malicious XML-RPC request to `supervisord` that will run arbitrary shell commands on the server. The commands will be run as the same user as `supervisord`. Depending on how `supervisord` has been configured, this may be root.\r

                            \r

                            ## Details\r

                            * `supervisord` is the server component and is responsible for starting child processes, responding to commands from clients, and other commands.\r

                            * `supervisorctl` is the command line component, providing a shell-like interface to the features provided by `supervisord`.\r

                            \r

                            `supervisord` can be configured to run an HTTP server on a TCP socket and/or a Unix domain socket. This HTTP server is how `supervisorctl` communicates with `supervisord`. If an HTTP server has been enabled, it will always serve both HTML pages and an XML-RPC interface. A vulnerability has been found where an authenticated client can send a malicious XML-RPC request to `supervisord` that will run arbitrary shell commands on the server. The commands will be run as the same user as `supervisord`. Depending on how `supervisord` has been configured, this may be root.\r

                            This vulnerability can only be exploited by an authenticated client or if `supervisord` has been configured to run an HTTP server without authentication. If authentication has not been enabled, `supervisord` will log a message at the critical level every time it starts.\r

                            \r

                            ## PoC by Maor Shwartz\r

                            \r

                            Create a config file `supervisord.conf`:\r

                            \r

                            ```conf\r

                            [supervisord]\r

                            loglevel = trace\r

                            \r

                            [inet_http_server]\r

                            port = 127.0.0.1:9001\r

                            \r

                            [rpcinterface:supervisor]\r

                            supervisor.rpcinterface_factory = supervisor.rpcinterface:make_main_rpcinterface\r

                            ```\r

                            \r

                            Start supervisord in the foreground with that config file:\r

                            \r

                            ```\r

                            $ supervisord -n -c supervisord.conf\r

                            ```\r

                            \r

                            In a new terminal:\r

                            \r

                            ```py\r

                            $ python2\r

                            >>> from xmlrpclib import ServerProxy\r

                            >>> server = ServerProxy('http://127.0.0.1:9001/RPC2')\r

                            >>> server.supervisor.supervisord.options.execve('/bin/sh', [], {})\r

                            \  ```\r

                            \r

                            If the `supervisord` version is vulnerable, the `execve` will be executed and the `supervisord` process will be replaced with /bin/sh (or any other command given). If the `supervisord` version is not vulnerable, it will return an `UNKNOWN_METHOD` fault.\r

                            \r

                            \r

                            ## Remediation\r

                            Upgrade `supervisor` to version 3.3.3 or higher.\r

                            \r

                            ## Overview
                            [`rsa`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rsa) is a Pure-Python RSA implementation.

                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication Bypass due to not implementing authentication encryption or use MACs to validate messages before decrypting public key encrypted messages.

                            The [`json`](https://rubygems.org/gems/json) gem is a JSON implementation as a Ruby extension in C.

                            Affected versions of this Gem contain an overflow condition. This is triggered when user-supplied input is not properly validated while handling specially crafted data. This can allow a remote attacker to cause a stack-based buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service, or potentially allowing the [execution of arbitrary code](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-JSON-20209).


                            ## Details

                            Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\r

                            \r

                            Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\r

                            \r

                            One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\r

                            \r

                            When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\r

                            \r

                            Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\r

                            \r

                            * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\r

                            \r

                            * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

                            ## Overview
                            The [`json`](https://rubygems.org/gems/json) gem is a JSON implementation as a Ruby extension in C.
                            Affected versions of this Gem are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and unsafe object creation vulnerabilities. When parsing certain JSON documents, the JSON gem tricked into creating Ruby symbols in a target system.

                            ## Details

                            When parsing certain JSON documents, the JSON gem can be coerced in to creating Ruby symbols in a target system.  Since Ruby symbols are not garbage collected, this can result in a denial of service attack.

                            The same technique can be used to create objects in a target system that act like internal objects.  These "act alike" objects can be used to bypass certain security mechanisms and can be used as a spring board for SQL injection attacks in Ruby on Rails.

                            Impacted code looks like this:
                            ```js
                            JSON.parse(user_input)
                            ```
                            Where the `user_input` variable will have a JSON document like this:
                            ```json
                            {"json_class":"foo"}
                            ```
                            The JSON gem will attempt to look up the constant "foo".  Looking up this constant will create a symbol.

                            In JSON version 1.7.x, objects with arbitrary attributes can be created using JSON documents like this:
                            ```json
                            {"json_class":"JSON::GenericObject","foo":"bar"}
                            ```
                            This document will result in an instance of `JSON::GenericObject`, with the attribute "foo" that has the value "bar".  Instantiating these objects will result in arbitrary symbol creation and in some cases can be used to bypass security measures.

                            PLEASE NOTE: this behavior *does not change* when using `JSON.load`.  `JSON.load` should *never* be given input from unknown sources.  If you are processing JSON from an unknown source, *always* use `JSON.parse`.

                            ## Overview

                            The [`json`](https://rubygems.org/gems/json) gem is a JSON implementation as a Ruby extension in C.

                            Affected versions of this Gem contain an overflow condition. This is triggered when user-supplied input is not properly validated while handling specially crafted data. This can allow a remote attacker to cause a stack-based buffer overflow, resulting in a [denial of service](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-JSON-20000), or potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.

                            ## Overview

                            [rack](https://rack.github.io/) is a minimal, modular and adaptable interface for developing web applications in Ruby. By wrapping HTTP requests and responses in the simplest way possible, it unifies and distills the API for web servers, web frameworks, and software in between (the so-called middleware) into a single method call.


                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Exposure.
                            Attackers may be able to find and hijack sessions by using timing attacks targeting the session id. Session ids are usually stored and indexed in a database that uses some kind of scheme for speeding up lookups of that session id. By carefully measuring the amount of time it takes to look up a session, an attacker may be able to find a valid session id and hijack the session.

                            ## Remediation

                            Upgrade `rack` to version 1.6.12, 2.0.8 or higher.

                            [rack-cache](https://rubygems.org/gems/rack-cache) enables HTTP caching for Rack-based applications.
                            Affected versions of this gem contain a flaw related to the rubygem caching sensitive HTTP headers. This will result in a weakness that may make it easier for an attacker to gain access to a user's session via a specially crafted header.

                            ## Overview
                            [`redis-store`](https://rubygems.org/gems/redis-store) is a namespaced Rack::Session, Rack::Cache, I18n and cache Redis stores for Ruby web frameworks.

                            Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data.

                            # Details
                            Serialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.

                            _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.

                            An attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.

                            ## Remediation
                            Upgrade `redis-store` to version 1.4.0 or higher.

                            [rails-html-sanitizer](https://github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer)


                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). The gem allows non-whitelisted attributes to be present in sanitized output when input with specially-crafted HTML fragments, and these attributes can lead to an XSS attack on target applications.


                            This issue is similar to [CVE-2018-8048](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-LOOFAH-22023) in Loofah.


                            ## Details

                            A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\r

                            \r

                            This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\r

                            \r

                            ֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\r

                            \r

                            Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\r

                            \ \r

                            The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \r

                            \r

                            ### Types of attacks\r

                            There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\r

                            \r

                            |Type|Origin|Description|\r

                            |--|--|--|\r

                            |**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\r

                            |**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \r

                            |**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\r

                            |**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\r

                            \r

                            ### Affected environments\r

                            The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\r

                            \r

                            * Web servers\r

                            * Application servers\r

                            * Web application environments\r

                            \r

                            ### How to prevent\r

                            This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \r

                            \r

                            * Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \r

                            * Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \r

                            * Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\r

                            * Redirect invalid requests.\r

                            * Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\r

                            * Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\r

                            * Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.



                            ## Remediation

                            Upgrade `rails-html-sanitizer` to version 1.0.4 or higher.

                            ## Overview
                            [`com.ning:async-http-client`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22async-http-client%22)
                            Async Http Client (aka AHC or async-http-client) before 1.9.0 skips X.509 certificate verification unless both a keyStore location and a trustStore location are explicitly set, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof HTTPS servers by presenting an arbitrary certificate during use of a typical AHC configuration, as demonstrated by a configuration that does not send client certificates.

                            ## Overview

                            [io.netty:netty](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22netty%22) is a NIO client server framework which enables quick and easy development of network applications such as protocol servers and clients.


                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Disclosure.
                            It does not validate cookie name and value characters, allowing attackers to potentially bypass the `httpOnly` flag on sensitive cookies.

                            ## Remediation

                            Upgrade `io.netty:netty` to version 3.9.8.Final, 3.10.3.Final or higher.

                            ## Overview

                            [io.netty:netty](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22netty%22) is a NIO client server framework which enables quick and easy development of network applications such as protocol servers and clients.


                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling.
                            Netty mishandles whitespace before the colon in HTTP headers such as a `Transfer-Encoding : chunked` line. This can lead to HTTP request smuggling where an attacker can bypass security controls, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, and directly compromise other application users.

                            ## Remediation

                            There is no fixed version for `io.netty:netty`.

                            [org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient](http://hc.apache.org/) is a HttpClient component of the Apache HttpComponents project.



                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal.

                            String input by user is not validated for the presence of leading character `/` and is passed to the constructor as `path` information, resulting in a Directory Traversal vulnerability.


                            ## Details

                            A Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\r

                            \r

                            Directory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\r

                            \r

                            - **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\r

                            \r

                            `st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\r

                            \r

                            If an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\r

                            \r

                            ```\r

                            curl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\r

                            ```\r

                            **Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\r

                            \r

                            - **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`. \r

                            \r

                            One way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\r

                            \r

                            The following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\r

                            \r

                            ```\r

                            2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\r

                            2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\r

                            ```



                            ## Remediation


                            Upgrade `org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient` to version 4.5.3 or higher.

                            A Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\r

                            \r

                            Directory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\r

                            \r

                            - **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\r

                            \r

                            `st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\r

                            \r

                            If an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\r

                            \r

                            ```\r

                            curl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\r

                            ```\r

                            **Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\r

                            \r

                            - **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`. \r

                            \r

                            One way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\r

                            \r

                            The following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\r

                            \r

                            ```\r

                            2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\r

                            2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\r

                            ```

                          description: "## Overview


                            [org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-util](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty) is a Web Container & Clients - supports HTTP/2, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/1.0, websocket, servlets, and more.



                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

                            when a remote client uses a specially formatted URL against the `DefaultServlet` or `ResourceHandler` that is configured for showing a listing of directory contents.


                            ## Details

                            A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\r

                            \r

                            This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\r

                            \r

                            ֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\r

                            \r

                            Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\r

                            \ \r

                            The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \r

                            \r

                            ### Types of attacks\r

                            There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\r

                            \r

                            |Type|Origin|Description|\r

                            |--|--|--|\r

                            |**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\r

                            |**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \r

                            |**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\r

                            |**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\r

                            \r

                            ### Affected environments\r

                            The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\r

                            \r

                            * Web servers\r

                            * Application servers\r

                            * Web application environments\r

                            \r

                            ### How to prevent\r

                            This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \r

                            \r

                            * Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \r

                            * Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \r

                            * Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\r

                            * Redirect invalid requests.\r

                            * Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\r

                            * Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\r

                            * Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.

                            \r

                            ֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\r

                            \r

                            Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\r

                            \ \r

                            The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \r

                            \r

                            ### Types of attacks\r

                            There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\r

                            \r

                            |Type|Origin|Description|\r

                            |--|--|--|\r

                            |**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\r

                            |**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \r

                            |**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\r

                            |**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\r

                            \r

                            ### Affected environments\r

                            The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\r

                            \r

                            * Web servers\r

                            * Application servers\r

                            \r

                            ### How to prevent\r

                            This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \r

                            \r

                            * Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \r

                            * Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \r

                            * Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\r

                            * Redirect invalid requests.\r

                            * Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\r

                            * Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\r

                            * Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.

                          description: "## Overview


                            [org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-util](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty) is a Web Container & Clients - supports HTTP/2, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/1.0, websocket, servlets, and more.



                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

                            when a remote client uses a specially formatted URL against the `DefaultServlet` or `ResourceHandler` that is configured for showing a listing of directory contents.


                            ## Details

                            A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\r

                            \r

                            This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\r

                            \r

                            ֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\r

                            \r

                            Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\r

                            \ \r

                            The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \r

                            \r

                            ### Types of attacks\r

                            There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\r

                            [org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-util](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty) is a Web Container & Clients - supports HTTP/2, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/1.0, websocket, servlets, and more.



                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

                            when a remote client uses a specially formatted URL against the `DefaultServlet` or `ResourceHandler` that is configured for showing a listing of directory contents.


                            ## Details

                            A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\r

                            \r

                            This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\r

                            \r

                            ֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\r

                            \r

                            Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\r

                            \ \r

                            The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \r

                            \r

                            ### Types of attacks\r

                            There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\r

                            \r

                            |Type|Origin|Description|\r

                            |--|--|--|\r

                            |**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\r

                            |**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \r

                            |**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\r

                            |**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\r

                            \r

                            ### Affected environments\r

                            The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\r

                            \r

                            * Web servers\r

                            * Application servers\r

                            * Web application environments\r

                            \r

                            ### How to prevent\r

                            This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \r

                            \r

                            * Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \r

                            * Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \r

                            * Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\r

                            * Redirect invalid requests.\r

                            * Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\r

                            * Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\r

                            * Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.

                            ## Overview
                            Affected versions of [`org.scala-lang:scala-compiler`](https://scala-lang.org) are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution.

                            The compilation daemon in Scala before 2.10.7, 2.11.x before 2.11.12, and 2.12.x before 2.12.4 uses weak permissions for private files in /tmp/scala-devel/${USER:shared}/scalac-compile-server-port, which allows local users to write to arbitrary class files and consequently gain privileges.

                            ## Remediation
                            Upgrade `org.scala-lang:scala-compiler` to version 2.12.4 or higher.

                            [org.apache.flex.blazeds:blazeds](https://github.com/apache/flex-blazeds) is an application development framework for easily building Flash-based applications for mobile devices, web browsers, and desktops.



                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution.

                            The AMF deserialization implementation of Flex BlazeDS is vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data. By sending a specially crafted AMF message, it is possible to make the server establish a connection to an endpoint specified in the message and request an RMI remote object from that endpoint. This can result in the execution of arbitrary code on the server via Java deserialization.\r

                            \r

                            Starting with BlazeDS version `4.7.3`, Deserialization of XML is disabled completely per default, while the `ClassDeserializationValidator` allows deserialization of whitelisted classes only. BlazeDS internally comes with the following whitelist:\r

                            ```\r

                            ## Overview
                            [`node-uuid`](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-uuid) is a Simple, fast generation of RFC4122 UUIDS.

                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Randomness. It uses the cryptographically insecure `Math.random` which can produce predictable values and should not be used in security-sensitive context.

                            ## Remediation
                            Upgrade `node-uuid` to version 1.4.4 or greater.

                            [qs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs) is a querystring parser that supports nesting and arrays, with a depth limit.



                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (Memory Exhaustion).

                            During parsing, the `qs` module may create a sparse area (an array where no elements are filled), and grow that array to the necessary size based on the indices used on it. An attacker can specify a high index value in a query string, thus making the server allocate a respectively big array. Truly large values can cause the server to run out of memory and cause it to crash - thus enabling a Denial-of-Service attack.


                            ## Remediation


                            Upgrade `qs` to version 1.0.0 or higher.



                            ## Details

                            Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\r

                            \r

                            Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\r

                            \r

                            One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\r

                            \r

                            When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\r

                            \r

                            Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\r

                            \r

                            * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\r

                            \r

                            * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (Event Loop Blocking).

                            When parsing a string representing a deeply nested object, qs will block the event loop for long periods of time. Such a delay may hold up the server's resources, keeping it from processing other requests in the meantime, thus enabling a Denial-of-Service attack.

                          description: "## Overview


                            [qs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs) is a querystring parser that supports nesting and arrays, with a depth limit.



                            Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Override Protection Bypass.

                            By default `qs` protects against attacks that attempt to overwrite an object's existing prototype properties, such as `toString()`, `hasOwnProperty()`,etc.\r

                            \r

                            From [`qs` documentation](https://github.com/ljharb/qs):\r

                            > By default parameters that would overwrite properties on the object prototype are ignored, if you wish to keep the data from those fields either use plainObjects as mentioned above, or set allowPrototypes to true which will allow user input to overwrite those properties. WARNING It is generally a bad idea to enable this option as it can cause problems when attempting to use the properties that have been overwritten. Always be careful with this option.\r

                            \r

                            Overwriting these properties can impact application logic, potentially allowing attackers to work around security controls, modify data, make the application unstable and more.\r

                            \r

                            In versions of the package affected by this vulnerability, it is possible to circumvent this protection and overwrite prototype properties and functions by prefixing the name of the parameter with `[` or `]`. e.g. `qs.parse(\"]=toString\")` will return `{toString = true}`, as a result, calling `toString()` on the object will throw an exception.\r

                            \r

                            **Example:**\r

                            ```js\r

                            qs.parse('toString=foo', { allowPrototypes: false })\r

                            // {}\r

                            \r

                            qs.parse(\"]=toString\", { allowPrototypes: false })\r

                            // {toString = true} <== prototype overwritten\r

                            ```\r

                            \r
