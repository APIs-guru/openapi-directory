      "description": "The Shipments service manages shipments and shipment plans.\n\nThis is an Alpha version of the Shipments API and can still be changed in future releases.\n\nA shipment describes a structure of a multimodal logistics journey. Shipments are useful when\nthe lifetime of an asset one is tracking spans across multiple devices.\n\nA shipment consists of segments that span from a location to another. The segments and their\norigins and destinations must form a continuous chain of locations, that is the origin of a segment\nmust match the destination of a previous segment. Each segment of the shipment may be assigned a\n`trackingId` that can vary between segments. Devices assigned to a shipment generate traces\nand events for the entire shipment.\n\nThe `shipmentId` of a shipment can be used in similar fashion as a `trackingId` in selected\nAPIs. For example, one can query for shipment ***traces*** and ***events*** and associate ***aliases*** and\n***metadata*** to a shipment.\n\nEach shipment has one of the following statuses:\n* ***pending***: The shipment has not yet started.\n* ***ongoing***: The shipment has started and it has one segment ongoing.\n* ***completed***: The shipment has ended and all of its segments are completed.\n* ***cancelled***: The shipment has ended and it has one or more cancelled segments.\n\nHERE Tracking progresses the shipment automatically if each segment has been assigned a\n`trackingId` and the origin and destination locations contain a `geofenceId`. Each segment is\nstarted upon exiting the origin location of the segment and completed upon entering the\ndestination location of the segment. If the origin and the destination of a segment share the\nsame location (that is, dwelling in a single location), the segment will automatically be started after the\nprevious segment was completed. If a segment does not have a device assigned, the user must\nstart and complete the segment manually.\n\nA new shipment should be instantiated for each separate logistical journey. However, if the\nstructure of the shipment is recurring, a shipment plan can be defined. A shipment plan can\nbe used to define a generic skeleton for a logistical journey. For example, certain types\nof assets often need to be shipped over a typical sequence of locations.\nA user can create a shipment plan defining the segments, and new shipments can be instantiated from the plan.\nThis allows recycling of components for similar shipments and reduces time and effort for\ncreating new shipment instances.\n\nShipments can also be created, managed and visualized via the [Shipment Tracking web](https://shipment.tracking.here.com).\n",

The external device is added to connector.\n- `connectorId`: Identifier of the could-to-cloud connector.\nIn case only `name` is provided, a new device is provisioned and claimed to the project. `deviceId` and `deviceSecret` will be provided via \"Gets bulk upload results\" API\n\n### Device settings, labels and associations\n- `sampleMs`: Device sampling rate in milliseconds\n- `sendMs`: Device sending rate in milliseconds (should be equal or greater than sampleMs)\n- `distanceM`: Device sends an update if it has moved farther than the specified distance in meters\n- `areaBased`: Set true/1 if device should be configured to area based mode.\n- `type`: The type of the asset. Can be any user defined string. Type is saved to labels service.\n- `tags`: There are two ways of defining tags in the csv format. Tags are saved to labels service.\n  + `tag:{any}`, e.g. `tag:priority 1,tag:priority 2`: In device row, the tag is applied to the device if the corresponding column has `1` in it.\n  + `tags`: In device row and tags column provide tags separated by `|`, e.g. `priority 1|priority 2`\n- `geofences`: There are two ways of defining geofences to be associated with the device:\n  + `geofence:{geofenceId}`, e.g. `geofence:e0de7cbc-9328-4e37-b865-cdbe1fa1c7dc`: In device row, the geofence is associated to the device if the corresponding column has `1` in it.\n  + `geofences`: In the device row and geofences column provide geofenceIds to be associated with the device, separated by `|` e.g. `2b4c5571-e398-45c5-9637-6ce63e320b4f|e0de7cbc-9328-4e37-b865-cdbe1fa1c7dc`\n- `rules`: There are two ways of defining rules to be associated with the device. The functionality is the same as for geofences. Rules cover both sensor rules that are managed via sensors/v3 endpoint and other rules that are managed via rules/v4 endpoint.\n  + `rule:{ruleId}`, e.g. `rule:e0de7cbc-9328-4e37-b865-cdbe1fa1c7dc`\n  + `rules`: In the device row in rules column specify the rules to be associated to the device, separated by `|`, e.g. `2b4c5571-e398-45c5-9637-6ce63e320b4f|e0de7cbc-9328-4e37-b865-cdbe1fa1c7dc`\n\nExample 1:\n```\nname,deviceId,externalId,externalDeviceId,connectorId,sendMs,sampleMs,areaBased,distanceM,geofence:e0de7cbc-9328-4e37-b865-cdbe1fa1c7dc,geofence:2b4c5571-e398-45c5-9637-6ce63e320b4f,rule:b647155e-0789-4fa0-8807-154332c0617d,type\nMy HW tracker 1,1ae212e7-c342-4108-ad26-45df1a8e2631,,,,600000,120000,,,1,1,1,Warehouse\nUnprovisioned device,,,,,600000,120000,,100,,,,Phone\nVirtual tracker,,MyDevice,,,900000,180000,1,,1,1,,Heavy Machinery\nMy external cloud tracker,,,MyExternalDeviceIdentifier,CON-8bfd6006-5fe6-400f-8a0a-ca73d44866f3,,,,,1,,1,Airport / Air Cargo\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\nname,tags,geofences\ntracker1,Priority1;Important,2b4c5571-e398-45c5-9637-6ce63e320b4f|e0de7cbc-9328-4e37-b865-cdbe1fa1c7dc\ntracker2,Important,e0de7cbc-9328-4e37-b865-cdbe1fa1c7dc\n```\n\n## Delete devices\nEach row represents a single tracker to be deleted. Trackers can be identified by\n`trackingId`, `externalId` (for virtual devices) or `externalDeviceId` along with\n`connectorId` (for external cloud devices).\nBy default the provided tracker will be both unclaimed and unprovisioned.\nWith boolean property `unclaimOnly` one can bypass unprovisioning for selected devices\nand with `removeFromConnectorOnly` both unclaiming and unprovisioning steps will be skipped.\n\nExample:\n```\ntrackingId,externalId,externalDeviceId,connectorId,unclaimOnly,removeFromConnectorOnly\nHERE-ef63c528-0aea-4f9f-a160-368559fa31ed,,,,1,\nHERE-aba23346-5248-49db-bea8-9f75aa81d3dd,,,,,\n,MyDevice,,,,\n,,MyExternalDevice,CON-8bfd6006-5fe6-400f-8a0a-ca73d44866f3,,1\n```\n",

A single device is counted only once.\n\nFor example, a device A is associated to 2 geofences and is inside one and outside the other.\nA device B is associated to 3 geofences and is outside all of them. With the request \nquery parameter set as `groupBy`=`eventSource`, the response body will contain the following result item:\n```\n{\n  \"eventSource\": \"geofence\",\n  \"INSIDE_GEOFENCE\": 1,\n  \"OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE\": 2,\n  \"total\": 2\n}.\n```\n\nIf the request is supplied with `eventSource` query parameter, the response results will be limited\nto the specified rule types only.\n\nIf the request is supplied with `ruleId` query parameter, the response results will be limited\nto the specified rule IDs only.\n\nIf the request is supplied with `trackingId` query parameter, the response results will be limited\nto the specified devices only.

When the cover is open,\nthe device is considered to be tampered with.\nEvery time the device reports getting attached, detached, tampered with or left with the \ncover closed (that is, not tampered with), an event gets triggered.\n\nWhen a sensor rule has been successfully created, the response body will contain the created rule ID.\n",

For more information on this standard, see the [OAuth Core 1.0](https://oauth.net/core/1.0/) specification.\n\n> **Note:** You must create a new signature for each token request to HERE Tracking. Signatures can only be used once.\n\nCreate the Signature Base String\n---\n\nThe first step in creating a signature is to create the signature base string. This string contains the parameters to use when generating the signature.\n\n*1. To begin, make sure you have the information listed in the following table.*\n\n| Parameter                | Description                              |\n| ------------------------ | -----------------------------------------|\n| oauth\\_consumer\\_key     | The device ID for which you want to generate a token. |\n| oauth\\_signature\\_method | Always use \"HMAC-SHA256\".                 |\n| oauth\\_timestamp         | The number of seconds since the Unix epoch at the point the request is generated. This must be within 10 seconds of the timestamp returned by the `/v2/timestamp` endpoint. |\n| oauth\\_nonce             | A unique string for this signature. The string cannot have been used in a previous signature. Each token generation request to HERE Tracking must have a unique signature, and the value in this parameter is what is used to ensure the signature is unique. |\n| oauth\\_version           | Always use \"1.0\".                         |\n\n*2. Combine these values into a single string by following these steps:*\n\n   1. URL encode every key and value.\n   2. Sort the list of key-value pairs alphabetically by key.\n   3. Concatenate each key/value pair, separating each with an ampersand character (\"&\").\n\nThe result is a parameter string that looks like this (line breaks are added for legibility):\n\n   ```\n   oauth_consumer_key=47164fb0-b7b3-49e8-891b-650270b82cf2\n   &oauth_nonce=LIIpk4\n   &oauth_signature_method=HMAC-SHA256\n   &oauth_timestamp=1513634609\n   &oauth_version=1.0\n   ```\n\n*3. Combine the HTTP method, base URL, and parameter string into a single string called the \"base string\". This will be the string from which the signature is generated. The base string is in this format:*\n\n   ```\n   POST&https://tracking.api.here.com/v2/token&<URL encoded parameter string>\n   ```\n\n   The base string consists of:\n\n   1. The HTTP method in caps (POST) followed by an ampersand (\"&\")\n   2. The URL of the HERE Tracking token endpoint followed by an ampersand (\"&\")\n   3. The URL-encoded parameter string.\n\n   For example (line breaks are added for legibility):\n\n   ```\n   POST\n    &https%3A%2F%2Ftracking.api.here.com%2Fv2%2Ftoken\n    &oauth_consumer_key%3D47164fb0-b7b3-49e8-891b-650270b82cf2%26\n    oauth_nonce%3DLIIpk4%26oauth_signature_method%3DHMAC-SHA256%26\n    oauth_timestamp%3D1513634609%26oauth_version%3D1.0\n   ```\n\n   > **Note:** The URL-encoded base string should contain exactly two ampersands (\"&\").\n\nCreate the signature\n---\n\nThe signing key used to sign the base string is the `deviceSecret` followed by an ampersand (\"&\").\n\nCreate the signature by passing the signature base string and the signing key to the `HMAC-SHA256` hashing algorithm and converting the result to a `base64` string. Then, use the signature to request a token.\n\nRequest the token\n---\n\nMake a `POST` request to this endpoint with an `Authorization` header constructed from the above parameters and the generated signature.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n    Authorization: OAuth oauth_consumer_key=\"47164fb0-b7b3-49e8-891b-650270b82cf2\",\n        oauth_signature_method=\"HMAC-SHA256\",\n        oauth_timestamp=\"1513634609\",\n        oauth_nonce=\"LIIpk4\",\n        oauth_version=\"1.0\",\n        oauth_signature=\"pQ9EJX14L736B%2Br7uZl4yQlO6Xw%3D\"\n```\n",
