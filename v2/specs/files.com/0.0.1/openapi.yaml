        All File and Login actions on Files.com are recorded and can be queried via our History API.

        This set of endpoints only provides access to recent actions (actions created within 24 hours).  In most cases,
        you would be better served to create a Webhook, which sends actions to your server, rather than poll this endpoint.

        The HistoryExport set of endpoints provides a richer ability to query and filter, as well as search the entire
        lifetime of your history log.

        The Action Notification Export API provides access to outgoing webhook logs. Querying webhook logs is a little different than other APIs.

        All queries against the archive must be submitted as Exports.  (Even our Web UI creates an Export behind the scenes.)

        In any query field in this API, you may specify multiple values separated by commas.  That means that commas
        cannot be searched for themselves, and neither can single quotation marks.

        Use the following steps to complete an export:

        1. Initiate the export by using the Create Action Notification Export endpoint. Non Site Admins must query by folder or path.
        2. Using the `id` from the response to step 1, poll the Show Action Notification Export endpoint. Check the `status` field until it is `ready`.
        3. You can download the results of the export as a CSV file using the `results_url` field in the response from step 2. If you want to page through the records in JSON format, use the List Action Notification Export Results endpoint, passing the `id` that you got in step 1 as the `action_notification_export_id` parameter. Check the `X-Files-Cursor-Next` header to see if there are more records available, and resubmit the same request with a `cursor` parameter to fetch the next page of results.  Unlike most API Endpoints, this endpoint does not provide `X-Files-Cursor-Prev` cursors allowing reverse pagination through the results.  This is due to limitations in Amazon Athena, the underlying data lake for these records.

        If you intend to use this API for high volume or automated use, please contact us with more information
        about your use case.

        ## Example Queries

        * History for a folder: `{ "query_folder": "path/to/folder" }`
        * History for a range of time: `{ "start_at": "2021-03-18 12:00:00", "end_at": "2021-03-19 12:00:00" }`
        * History of all notifications that used GET or POST: `{ "query_request_method": "GET,POST" }`

        Automations allow you to automate workflows on your Files.com site.

        Automations are different from Behaviors because Behaviors are associated with a current folder, while Automations apply across your entire site.
        Although Automations may have a Path specified, it can be a glob (which includes wildcards), which affects multiple folders.
        Additionally, paths in Automations can refer to folders which don't yet exist.

        Automations are never removed when folders are removed, while Behaviors are removed when the associated folder is removed.


        ## Automation Triggers

        Automations can be triggered in the following ways:

        * `custom_schedule` : The automation will run according to the custom schedule parameters for `days_of_week` (0-based) and `times_of_day`. A time zone may be specified via `time_zone` in Rails TimeZone name format.
        * `daily` : The automation will run once each day
        * `realtime` : The automation will run any time a local file (not stored in a remote mount folder) is created, updated, or deleted.
        * `webhook` : the automation will run when a request is sent to the corresponding webhook URL.
        * `action` : The automation will run when a specific action happens, e.g. a file is created, deleted, or downloaded.

        Future enhancements will allow Automations to be triggered by an incoming email, or by other services.

        Currently, all Automation types support all triggers, with the following exceptions: The `realtime` trigger is only supported by the `Request File` and `Request Move` Automations.
        We plan to add support for this trigger to all Automation types. If you have a use case for the `realtime` trigger on an Automation that's not currently supported, please contact us and tell us more about your situation.


        ## Automation Types

        There are currently five types of automations:  Create Folder, Copy File, Delete File, Request File, and Request Move.


        ### Create Folder

        Creates the folder with named by `destinations` in the path named by `path`.
        Destination may include formatting parameters to insert the date/time into the destination name.

        Example Use case:  Our business files sales tax for each division in 11 states every quarter.
        I want to create the folders where those sales tax forms and data will be collected.

        I could create a Create Folder automation as follows:

        * Trigger: `daily`
        * Interval: `quarter_end`
        * Path: `/AccountingAndTax/SalesTax/State/*/`
        * Destinations: `%Y/Quarter-ending-%m-%d`


        ### Delete File

        Deletes the file with path matching `source` (wildcards allowed) in the path named by `path`.


        ### Copy File

        Copies files in the folder named by `path` to the path specified in `destinations`.
        If the parameter `source` exists, the automation will only fire on files matching the source (wildcards allowed).
        If the parameter `limit` exists, the automation will only copy the newest `limit` files.


        ### Move File

        Moves files in the folder named by `path` to the path specified in `destinations`.
        If the parameter `source` exists, the automation will only fire on files matching the source (wildcards allowed).
        If the parameter `limit` exists, the automation will only move the newest `limit` files.


        ### Request File

        The Request File automation requests a file (optionally from a specific user) if it does not exist.

        It requests the file named in the parameter `destinations` in the path named by the parameter `path`.
        If the parameter `source` exists, the automation will only fire if a file in that path exists.
        Destinations may include formatting parameters that are backreferences to the path.

        Example Use case: Continuing our Sales Tax example from above, once the folders are
        created for the 11 states, our Bookkeeper needs to upload a `.xlsx` file
        containing the sales records for each state.

        We can create a Request File automation as follows:

        * Trigger: `realtime`
        * Path: `/AccountingAndTax/SalesTax/State/*/*/*/`
        * Destinations: `SalesByState-%p3-%p2-%p1`
        * Group IDs: `123` (representing the Bookkeepers group)

        Note that the %p1, %p2 amd %p3 are references back into the folder hierarchy
        (parent 1, parent 2, etc), so that the file will be named with the state
        name and the quarter name in the file.  Example: `SalesByState-NV-2017-Quarter-ending-Dec-31.xlsx`

        Now, let's say that our Tax Accountant is in charge of filing the actual
        state tax return once the Excel doc is completed by the Bookkeeper.  We
        can create another Automation to let him know when it's his turn
        to operate:

        * Trigger: `realtime`
        * Path: `/AccountingAndTax/SalesTax/State/*/*/%/`
        * Source: `SalesByState-%p3-%p2-%p1`
        * Destinations: `StateSalesTaxReturn-Unsigned-%p3-%p2-%p1`
        * Group IDs: `124` (representing the Tax Accountants group)
            Group: Tax Accountants

        So the accountant will take the excel from the bookkeeper, generate the
        state tax return, and then upload it as a PDF, ready for the CFO to
        sign.  How does the CFO know when to sign?  You guessed it, another
        Automation will let him know when it's ready:

        * Trigger: `realtime`
        * Path: `/AccountingAndTax/**/`
        * Source: `*-Unsigned-*`
        * Destination Replace From: `-Unsigned-`
        * Destination Replace To: `-Signed-`
        * Group IDs: `125` (representing the CFO group)

        This Automation looks in every nested subfolder of `AcccountingAndTax`
        (that's the `/**/` in the path).  And it looks for any filename containing
        the filename string `-Unsigned-`.  That's the cue to the CFO that something needs his
        signature.

        Rather than specifying the exact destination filename, we can specify a Destination Replace From
        and To in order to generate the new filename from the old filename.

        So if `StateSalesTaxReturn-Unsigned-NV-2017-q4.pdf` is uploaded, this
        Automation will trigger and expect the file `StateSalesTaxReturn-Signed-NV-2017-q4.pdf`
        from the CFO.

        You could then put in place another rule for the Tax Accountant or
        Bookkeeper to go do the actual filing once a signature is in place.


        ### Request Move

        The Request Move automation requests that a file be moved.  This is an alternate way to implement approval workflows.

        A variant of the Request File automation, this Automation creates requests that a
        user or group move a file, presumably indicating that they've taken some action on it.

        Example Use case: Action Verb uses Files.com to collect invoices from its Contractors, who
        upload new invoices into their own folder structure that only they have
        permissions to.  That structure looks like this:

        * `/Accounts Payable/Contractors/[contractor]/New/`
        * `/Accounts Payable/Contractors/[contractor]/Paid/`

        The contractor has full permissions to the `New/` folder, but only
        read-only permissions to `Paid/`.  This allows them to upload and update
        new invoices, but only view invoices that are already paid.  (Cool!)

        But, as we grow to dozens of contractors, it becomes a tough task for
        Accounts Payable to check all the New folders daily.

        To ensure Contractors get paid timely, we might set up Request Move automation:

        * Trigger: `realtime`
        * Path: `/AccountsPayable/Contractors/*/New/`
        * Source: `*`
        * Destinations: `../Paid/`
        * Group IDs: `126` (representing the Accounts Payable group)

        Behaviors are the API resource for what are also known as Folder Settings.  Every behavior is associated with a folder.

        Depending on the behavior, it may also operate on child folders.  It may be overridable at the child folder level or maybe can be added to at the child folder level.  The exact options for each behavior type are explained in the table below.

        Additionally, some behaviors are visible to non-admins, and others are even settable by non-admins.  All the details are below.

        Each behavior uses a different format for storings its settings value.  Next to each behavior type is an example value.  Our API and SDKs currently require that the value for behaviors be sent as raw JSON within the `value` field.  Our SDK generator and API documentation generator doesn't fully keep up with this requirement, so if you need any help finding the exact syntax to use for your language or use case, just reach out.

            Form Field Sets define a custom forms to be used for bundle and inbox registrations.
            
            Each Form Field Set contains one or more Form Fields. A form and all of its form fields are submitted in a single create request. The order of form fields in the array is the order they will be displayed.
            
            Once created, a form field set can then be associated with one or more bundle(s) and/or inbox(s). Once associated, you will be required to submit well-formatted form-data when creating a bundle-registration or inbox registration.

        Groups are a powerful tool for permissions and user management on Files.com.  Users can belong to multiple groups.

        All permissions can be managed via Groups, and Groups can also be synced to your identity platform via LDAP or SCIM.

        Files.com's Group Admin feature allows you to define Group Admins, who then have access to add and remove users within their groups.

        A GroupUser describes the membership of a User within a Group.

        ## Creating GroupUsers
        GroupUsers can be created via the normal `create` action. When using the `update` action, if the
        GroupUser record does not exist for the given user/group IDs it will be created.

        The History Export resource on the API is used to export historical action (history) logs.

        All queries against the archive must be submitted as Exports.  (Even our Web UI creates an Export behind
        the scenes.)

        We use Amazon Athena behind the scenes for processing these queries, and as such, have powerful
        search capabilities.  We've done our best to expose search capabilities via this History Export API.

        In any query field in this API, you may specify multiple values separated by commas.  That means that commas
        cannot be searched for themselves, and neither can single quotation marks.

        We do not currently partition data by date on the backend, so all queries result in a full scan of the entire
        data lake.  This means that all queries will take about the same amount of time to complete, and we incur about
        the same cost per query internally.  We don't typically bill our customers for these queries, assuming
        usage is occasional and manual.

        If you intend to use this API for high volume or automated use, please contact us with more information
        about your use case.  We may decide to change the backend data schema to match your use case more closely, and
        we may also need to charge an additional cost per query.

        ## Example History Queries

        * History for a user: `{ "query_user_id": 123 }`
        * History for a range of time: `{ "start_at": "2021-03-18 12:00:00", "end_at": "2021-03-19 12:00:00" }`
        * History of logins and failed logins: `{ "query_action": "login,failedlogin" }`
        * A Complex query: `{ "query_folder": "uploads", "query_action": "create,copy,move", "start_at": "2021-03-18 12:00:00", "end_at": "2021-03-19 12:00:00" }`

        Locks are not used by Files.com's web interface, but can be used by your applications to
        implement locking and concurrency features. Note that these locks are advisory in nature,
        and creating a lock does not prevent other API requests from being fulfilled.

        Our lock feature is designed to emulate the locking feature offered by WebDAV.
        You can read the WebDAV spec and understand how all of the below endpoints work.

        Files.com's WebDAV offering and desktop app does leverage this locking API.

        Remote servers are used with the `remote_server_sync` Behavior.

        Remote Servers can be either an FTP server, SFTP server, S3 bucket, Google Cloud Storage, Wasabi, Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage, Rackspace Cloud Files container, WebDAV, Box, Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, or Azure Blob Storage.

        Not every attribute will apply to every remote server.

        FTP Servers require that you specify their `hostname`, `port`, `username`, `password`, and a value for `ssl`.  Optionally, provide `server_certificate`.

        SFTP Servers require that you specify their `hostname`, `port`, `username`, `password` or `private_key`, and a value for `ssl`.  Optionally, provide `server_certificate`, `private_key_passphrase`.

        S3 Buckets require that you specify their `s3_bucket` name, and `s3_region`.  Optionally provide a `aws_access_key`, and `aws_secret_key`.  If you don't provide credentials, you will need to use AWS to grant us access to your bucket.

        S3-Compatible Buckets require that you specify `s3_compatible_bucket`, `s3_compatible_endpoint`, `s3_compatible_access_key`, and `s3_compatible_secret_key`.

        Google Cloud Storage requires that you specify `google_cloud_storage_bucket`, `google_cloud_storage_project_id`, and `google_cloud_storage_credentials_json`.

        Wasabi requires `wasabi_bucket`, `wasabi_region`, `wasabi_access_key`, and `wasabi_secret_key`.

        Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage `backblaze_b2_bucket`, `backblaze_b2_s3_endpoint`, `backblaze_b2_application_key`, and `backblaze_b2_key_id`. (Requires S3 Compatible API) See https://help.backblaze.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047425453

        Rackspace Cloud Files requires `rackspace_username`, `rackspace_api_key`, `rackspace_region`, and `rackspace_container`.

        WebDAV Servers require that you specify their `hostname`, `username`, and `password`.

        OneDrive follow the `auth_setup_link` and login with Microsoft.

        Sharepoint follow the `auth_setup_link` and login with Microsoft.

        Box follow the `auth_setup_link` and login with Box.

        Dropbox follow the `auth_setup_link` and login with Dropbox.

        Google Drive follow the `auth_setup_link` and login with Google.

        Azure Blob Storage `azure_blob_storage_account`, `azure_blob_storage_container`, `azure_blob_storage_access_key`, `azure_blob_storage_sas_token`

        Azure File Storage `azure_files_storage_account`, `azure_files_storage_access_key`, `azure_files_storage_share_name`

        Filebase requires `filebase_bucket`, `filebase_access_key`, and `filebase_secret_key`.

        An SSO Strategy is a method for allowing users to sign in via another identity provider, such as Okta or Auth0.

        It is rare that you will need to use API endpoints for managing these, and we recommend instead managing these via the web interface.
        Nevertheless, we share the API documentation here.

      This folder operates as an inbox where anonymous users can upload files without logging in.

      ## Path Templates

      Admins can customize how submission subfolders are created by providing a path_template value. For example, an inbox can be created with the following `path_template` value:

      > {{name}}_{ip}

      This will result in submission subfolders that look like `john doe_127.0.0.1`.

      Path templates can use any of the following standard fields:
      * name
      * company
      * email
      * ip

      They can also use any fields defined on the inbox's custom form field set. An inbox with a custom form field set with a field called 'My Field'
      can have a path template that looks like this:

      > {{name}}_{{My Field}}

      Note: Field names are case-sensitive.
