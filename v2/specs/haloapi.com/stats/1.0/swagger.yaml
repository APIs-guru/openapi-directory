            Indicates what Game Mode(s) the client is interested in getting Matches for (arena, campaign, custom, or warzone).

            When the parameter is omitted or empty, Matches from all modes are returned. When a client would like to receive Matches spanning multiple Modes, separate the Modes with a comma (e.g. "arena,custom"). There is no significance to the order the Modes are specified in this parameter.

            When an invalid Mode is specified, HTTP 400 ("Bad Request") is returned.

            When a valid Mode is specified more than once, HTTP 400 ("Bad Request") is returned.

            When specified, this indicates the starting index (0-based) for which the batch of results will begin at. For example, "start=0" indicates that the first qualifying result will be returned, no items are 'skipped'. Passing "start=10" indicates that the result will begin with the 11th item, the first 10 will be 'skipped'.

            When omitted, zero is assumed.

            When the value contains a non-digit, HTTP 400 ("Bad Request") is returned.

            When specified, this indicates the maximum quantity of items the client would like returned in the response.

            When omitted, 25 is assumed.

            When the value contains a non-digit or is exactly "0", HTTP 400 ("Bad Request") is returned.

            When the value is greater than the allowed range [1,25], the maximum allowed value is used instead. The "Count" field in the response will confirm the actual value that was used.

Passing "start=10" indicates that the result will begin with the 11th item, the first 10 will be 'skipped'.
