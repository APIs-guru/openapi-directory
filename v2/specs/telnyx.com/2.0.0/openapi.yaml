        This API allows dispatching the same operation described for the PUT sim_cards/:sim_card_id/network_preferences API for multiple SIM cards at once.<br/><br/>
        Although, a SIM card network preference may fail individually under any validation triggered as a consequence of its state. For example, a SIM can't have an in-progress OTA update for applying a Network Preference, so they'll fail when requested in this API. In that scenario, the specific error will be present in the response along with the successful definitions in the "errors" response node.

        Call forking allows you to stream the media from a call to a specific target in realtime. 
        This stream can be used to enable realtime audio analysis to support a 
        variety of use cases, including fraud detection, or the creation of AI-generated audio responses. 
        Requests must specify either the `target` attribute or the `rx` and `tx` attributes.

        **Expected Webhooks:**

        - `call.fork.started`
        - `call.fork.stopped`

        **Simple Telnyx RTP Encapsulation Protocol (STREP)**

        *Note: This header/encapsulation is not used when the `rx` and `tx`
        parameters have been specified; it only applies when media is forked
        using the `target` attribute.*

        If the destination for forked media is specified using the "target"
        attribute, the RTP will be encapsulated in an extra Telnyx protocol,
        which adds a 24 byte header to the RTP payload in each packet. The STREP
        header includes the Call Control `call_leg_id` for stream
        identification, along with bits that represent the direction (inbound or
        outbound) of the media. This 24-byte header sits between the UDP header
        and the RTP header.

        The STREP header makes it possible to fork RTP for multiple calls (or
        two RTP streams for the same call) to the same IP:port, where the
        streams can be demultiplexed by your application using the information
        in the header. Of course, it's still possible to ignore this header
        completely, for example, if sending forked media for different calls to
        different ports or IP addresses. In this case, simply strip 24 bytes
        (or use the second byte to find the header length) from the received UDP
        payload to get the RTP (RTP header and payload).

        ```

         11
           Static bits 11, always set to 11 to easily distinguish forked media
           from RTP (10) and T.38 media (usually 00) and SIP (which begins
           with a capital letter, so begins with bits 01). This is a magic number.

         Version
           Four bits to indicate the version number of the protocol, starting at 0001.

         L
           One bit to represent the leg of the call (A or B).
           0 represents the A (first) leg of the call.
           1 represents the B (second) leg of the call.

         D
           One bit to represent the direction of this RTP stream.
           0 represents media received by Telnyx.
           1 represents media transmitted by Telnyx.

         HeaderLen (1 byte)
           The length of the header in bytes.
           Note that this value does not include the length of the payload. The total
           size of the RTP can be calculated by subtracting the HeaderLen from the UDP
           length (minus 8 for the UDP header).
           In version 1, this value will always be 24.

         Reserved (6 bytes)
           Reserved for future use and to make sure that the header is a multiple of 32 bits

         Call Leg ID
           A 128-bit identifier for the call leg.
           This is the call_leg_id from Call Control.

        Play an audio file on the call until the required DTMF signals are gathered to build interactive menus.

        You can pass a list of valid digits along with an 'invalid_audio_url', which will be played back at the beginning of each prompt. Playback will be interrupted when a DTMF signal is received. The [Answer](/docs/api/v2/call-control/Call-Commands#CallControlAnswer) command must be issued before the `gather_using_audio` command.

        - `call.playback.started`

         Setting up a public IP will generate charges, and we won't be able to provide the IP if the account doesn't have a balance. In that case, this operation will succeed, but its status will change to failed eventually, and the resource will be updated with the associated status.

        A successful network preferences definition response. <br/><br/>
        The sent mobile_operator_networks_preferences parameter won't be applied to the main resource right away - this is an asynchronous operation. While interacting with this API, you will face the following scenarios:

          * The first request for this API will return an empty mobile_operator_networks_preferences with an in-progress OTA update resource in the ota_updates node containing the exact sent parameters to indicate the operation progress. The value will be applied to the principal object when the OTA update finishes its processing, thus indicating the SIM card network preference current state. 
          * The subsequent requests will contain the current state, that is what's applied to the SIM card settings, and return the related OTA update in the ota_updates node.
          
        The returned OTA updated (present in the ota_updates node) will, by default, be the resource related to the operation, not all of them.

      description: |
        Number Pool allows you to send messages from a pool of numbers of different types, assigning
        weights to each type. The pool consists of all the long code and toll free numbers
        assigned to the messaging profile.

        To disable this feature, set the object field to `null`.
      example:
        geomatch: false
        long_code_weight: 1
        skip_unhealthy: true
        sticky_sender: false
        toll_free_weight: 10
      nullable: true
      properties:
        geomatch:
          default: false
          description: |
            If set to true, Number Pool will try to choose a sending number with the same area code as the destination
            number. If there are no such numbers available, a nunber with a different area code will be chosen. Currently
            only NANP numbers are supported.

        long_code_weight:
          description: |
            Defines the probability weight for a Long Code number to be selected when sending a message.
            The higher the weight the higher the probability. The sum of the weights for all number types
            does not necessarily need to add to 100.  Weight must be a non-negative number, and when equal
            to zero it will remove the number type from the pool.
          example: 1
          type: number
        skip_unhealthy:
          description: |
            If set to true all unhealthy numbers will be automatically excluded from the pool.
            Health metrics per number are calculated on a regular basis, taking into account the deliverability
            rate and the amount of messages marked as spam by upstream carriers.
            Numbers with a deliverability rate below 25% or spam ratio over 75% will be considered unhealthy.
          example: true
          type: boolean
        sticky_sender:
          default: false
          description: |
            If set to true, Number Pool will try to choose the same sending number for all messages to a particular
            recipient. If the sending number becomes unhealthy and `skip_unhealthy` is set to true, a new
            number will be chosen.

            SIM cards are identified on their individual operator networks by a unique International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI). <br/>
            Mobile network operators connect mobile phone calls and communicate with their market SIM cards using their IMSIs. The IMSI is stored in the Subscriber  Identity Module (SIM) inside the device and is sent by the device to the appropriate network. It is used to acquire the details of the device in the Home  Location Register (HLR) or the Visitor Location Register (VLR).

          description: Enables Answering Machine Detection. When a call is answered, Telnyx runs real-time detection to determine if it was picked up by a human or a machine and sends an `call.machine.detection.ended` webhook with the analysis result. If 'greeting_end' or 'detect_words' is used and a 'machine' is detected, you will receive another 'call.machine.greeting.ended' webhook when the answering machine greeting ends with a beep or silence. If `detect_beep` is used, you will only receive 'call.machine.greeting.ended' if a beep is detected.
