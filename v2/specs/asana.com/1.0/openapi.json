      "description": "There are many cases where you want to accomplish a variety of work in the Asana API but want to minimize the number of HTTP requests you make. For example:\n\n* Modern browsers limit the number of requests that a single web page can\n  make at once.\n* Mobile apps will use more battery life to keep the cellular radio on\n  when making a series of requests.\n* There is an overhead cost to developing software that can make multiple\n  requests in parallel.\n* Some cloud platforms handle parallelism poorly, or disallow it\n  entirely.\n\n\nTo make development easier in these use cases, Asana provides a **batch API** that enables developers to perform multiple “actions” by making only a single HTTP request.\n\n#### Making a batch request\n\nTo make a batch request, send a `POST` request to `/batch`. Like other `POST` endpoints, the body should contain a `data` envelope. Inside this envelope should be a single `actions` field, containing a list of “action” objects.  Each action represents a standard request to an existing endpoint in the Asana API.\n\n**The maximum number of actions allowed in a single batch request is 10**. Making a batch request with no actions in it will result in a `400 Bad Request`.\n\nWhen the batch API receives the list of actions to execute, it will dispatch those actions to the already-implemented endpoints specified by the `relative_path` and `method` for each action. This happens in parallel, so all actions in the request will be processed simultaneously. There is no guarantee of the execution order for these actions, nor is there a way to use the output of one action as the input of another action (such as creating a task and then commenting on it).\n\nThe response to the batch request will contain (within the `data` envelope) a list of result objects, one for each action. The results are guaranteed to be in the same order as the actions in the request (e.g., the first result in the response corresponds to the first action in the request)\n\nThe batch API will always attempt to return a `200 Success` response with individual result objects for each individual action in the request. Only in certain cases (such as missing authorization or malformed JSON in the body) will the entire request fail with another status code. Even if every individual action in the request fails, the batch API will still return a `200 Success` response, and each result object in the response will contain the errors encountered with each action.\n\n#### Rate limiting\n\nThe batch API fully respects all of our rate limiting. This means that a batch request counts against *both* the standard rate limiter and the concurrent request limiter as though you had made a separate HTTP request for every individual action. For example, a batch request with five actions counts as five separate requests in the standard rate limiter, and counts as five concurrent requests in the concurrent request limiter. The batch request itself incurs no cost.\n\nIf any of the actions in a batch request would exceed any of the enforced limits, the *entire* request will fail with a `429 Too Many Requests` error. This is to prevent the unpredictability of which actions might succeed if not all of them could succeed.\n\n#### Restrictions\n\nNot every endpoint can be accessed through the batch API. Specifically, the following actions cannot be taken and will result in a `400 Bad Request` for that action:\n\n* Uploading attachments\n* Creating, getting, or deleting organization exports\n* Any SCIM operations\n* Nested calls to the batch API",

      "description": "_Note: Custom fields are a premium feature. Integrations which work with custom fields need to handle an assortment of use cases for free and premium users in context of free and premium organizations. For a detailed examination of which data users will have access in different circumstances, review the section below on access control._\n\nIn the Asana application, tasks, projects, and portfolios can hold user-specified [custom fields](https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/custom-fields) which provide extra information (e.g., a \"priority\" property with an associated value, or a number representing the time required to complete a task). This lets a user define the type of information that each item within a project or portfolio can contain in addition to the built-in fields that Asana provides.\n`display_value` is a read-only field that will always be a string. For apps that use custom fields, this is a great way to safely display/export the value of a custom field, regardless of its type. We suggest apps use this field in order to future-proof for changes to custom fields.\n\n#### Characteristics of custom fields\n\n* There is metadata that defines the custom field. This metadata can be shared across an entire workspace, or be specific to a project or portfolio.\n* Creating a custom field setting on a project or portfolio means each direct child will have the custom field. This is conceptually akin to adding columns in a database or a spreadsheet: every task (row) in the project (table) can contain information for that field, including \"blank\" values (i.e., `null` data). For portfolio custom fields, every project (row) in the portfolio (table) will contain information for the custom field.\n* Custom field settings only go one child deep. This means that a custom field setting on a portfolio will give each project the custom field, but not each task within those projects.\n* Tasks have custom field _values_ assigned to them.\n\n#### Types of custom fields\n\nIntegrations using custom fields need to be aware of the six basic types that a custom field can adopt. These types are:\n\n* `text` - an arbitrary, relatively short string of text\n* `number` - a number with a defined level of precision\n* `enum` - a selection of a single option from a defined list of options (i.e., mutually exclusive selections)\n* `multi_enum` - a selection of one or more options from a defined list of options (i.e., mutually inclusive selections)\n* `date` - a reference date with an optional time value\n* `people` - a list of active contributors (i.e., where their relationship to the work is defined in the custom field title)\n\n#### Example use case\n\nConsider an organization that has defined a custom field for \"Priority\". This field is of `enum` type and can have user-defined values of `Low`, `Medium`, or `High`. This is the field metadata, and it is visible within, and shared across, the entire organization.\n\nA project is then created in the organization, called \"Bugs\", and the \"Priority\" custom field is associated with that project. This will allow all tasks within the \"Bugs\" project to have an associated \"Priority\".\n\nA new task is created within \"Bugs\". This task, then, has a field named \"Priority\" which can take on the custom field value of one of `[null]`, `Low`, `Medium`, and `High`.\n\n#### Custom fields in the API\n\nThese custom fields are accessible via the API through a number of endpoints at the top level (e.g. `/custom_fields` and `/custom_field_settings`) and through requests on workspaces, portfolios, projects, and tasks resources. The API also provides a way to fetch both the metadata and data which define each particular custom field, so that a client application may render proper UI to display or edit the values.\n\nText fields are currently limited to 1024 characters. On tasks, their custom field value will have a `text_value` property to represent this field.\n\nNumber fields can have an arbitrary `precision` associated with them; for example, a precision of `2` would round its value to the second (hundredths) place (e.g., `1.2345` would round to `1.23`). On tasks, the custom field value will have a `number_value` property to represent this field.\n\n#### Enum fields\n\nEnum fields represent a selection from a list of options. On the metadata, they will contain all of the options in an array. Each option has 4 properties:\n\n* `gid` - the GID of this enum option. Note that this is the GID of the individual _option_. The custom field itself has a separate `gid`.\n* `name` - the name of the option (e.g., \"Choice #1\")\n* `enabled` - whether this field is enabled. Disabled fields are not available to choose from when disabled, and are visually hidden in the Asana application, but they remain in the metadata for custom field values which were set to the option before the option was disabled.\n* `color` - a color associated with this choice.\n\nOn the task's custom field value, the enum will have an `enum_value` property which will be the same as one of the choices from the list defined in the custom field metadata.\n\n#### Querying an organization for its custom fields\n\nFor custom fields shared across the workspace or organization, the workspace [can be queried](/docs/get-a-workspaces-custom-fields) for its list of defined custom fields. Like other collection queries, the fields will be returned as a compact record; slightly different from most other compact records is the fact that the compact record for custom fields includes `type` as well as `gid` and `name`.\n\n#### Accessing custom field definitions\n\nThe [custom fields](/docs/get-a-custom-field) reference describes how the metadata which defines a custom field is accessed. A GET request with a `gid` can be issued on the `/custom_fields` endpoint to fetch the full definition of a single custom field given its `gid` from (for instance) listing all custom fields on a workspace, or getting the `gid` from a custom field settings object or a task.\n\n#### Associating custom fields with a project or portfolio\n\nA mapping between a custom field and a project or portfolio is handled with a [custom field settings](/docs/asana-custom-field-settings) object. This object contains a reference for each of the custom fields and the project or portfolio, as well as additional information about the status of that particular custom field (e.g., `is_important`, which defines whether or not the custom field will appear in the list/grid on the Asana application).\n\n#### Accessing custom field values on tasks or projects\n\nThe [tasks](/docs/get-a-task) reference has information on how custom fields look on tasks. custom fields will return as an array on the property `custom_fields`, and each entry will contain, side-by-side, the compact representation of the custom field metadata and a `{typename}_value` property that stores the value set for the custom field.\n\nOf particular note is that the top-level `gid` of each entry in the `custom_fields` array is the `gid` of the custom field metadata, as it is the compact representation of this metadata. This can be used to refer to the full metadata by making a request to the `/custom_fields/{custom_fields_id}` endpoint as described above.\n\nCustom fields can be set just as in the Asana-defined fields on a task via `POST` or `PUT` requests. You can see an example in the [update a task](/docs/update-a-task) endpoint.\n\nCustom fields on projects follow this same pattern.\n\n#### Warning: Program defensively with regards to custom field definitions\n\nAsana application users have the ability to change the definitions of custom field metadata. This means that as you write scripts or applications to work with them, it is possible for the definitions to change at any time, which may cause an application using them to break or malfunction if it makes assumptions about the metadata for a particular custom field. When using custom fields, it is a good idea to program *defensively*, meaning you your application should double-check that the custom field metadata are what it expects.\n\nStoring the state of the custom field metadata for too long if you dynamically create a model for it can cause your model to become out of sync with the model stored in Asana. For example, if you encounter an `enum` value on a task that does not match any option in your metadata model, your metadata model has become out of date with the custom field metadata.\n\n#### Enabled and disabled values\n\nWhen information that is contained in a custom field value loses a logical association with its metadata definition, the value becomes disabled. This can happen in a couple of simple ways, for example, if you remove the custom field metadata from a project, or move a task with a custom field to a different project which does not have the custom field metadata associated with it. The value remains on the task, and the custom field metadata can still be found and examined, but as the context in which the custom field makes sense is gone, the custom field cannot change its value; it can only be cleared.\n\n_Note: Tasks that are associated with multiple projects do not become disabled, so long as at least one of the projects is still associated with the custom field metadata. In other words, tasks with multiple projects will retain logically associated to the set of custom field metadata represented by all of their projects._\n\nMoving the task back under a project with that custom field applied to it or applying the custom field metadata to the current project will return the custom field value to an enabled state. In this scenario, the custom field will be re-enabled and editable again.\n\nIn the Asana application, disabled fields are grayed out and not allowed to change, other than to be discarded. In the API, we return a property `enabled: false` to inform the external application that the value has been disabled.\n\nNote that the API enforces the same operations on disabled custom field values as hold in the Asana application: they may not have their values changed, since the lack of context for the values of a custom field in general doesn't provide enough information to know what new values should be. Setting the custom field value to `null` will clear and remove the custom field value from the task.\n\n#### Custom field access control\n\nCustom fields are a complex feature of the Asana platform, and their access in the Asana application and in the API vary based on the status of the user and project. When building your application, it is best to be defensive and not assume the given user will have read or write access to a custom field, and fail gracefully when this occurs.",

      "description": "An event is an object representing a change to a resource that was observed by an event subscription. Event streams rely on the same infrastructure as webhooks, which ensures events are delivered within a minute (on average). This system is designed for at most once delivery, meaning in exceptional circumstances a small number of events may be missing from the stream. For this reason, if your use case requires strong guarantees about processing all changes on a resource and cannot tolerate any missing events, regardless of how rare that might be, we recommend building a fallback polling system that fetches the resource periodically as well. Note that while webhooks cannot be replayed once delivered, events are retrievable from the event stream for 24 hours after being processed.\n\nIn general, requesting events on a resource is faster and subject to higher rate limits than requesting the resource itself. Additionally, change events \"bubble up\" (e.g., listening to events on a project would include when stories are added to tasks in the project, and even to subtasks).\n\nEstablish an initial sync token by making a request with no sync token. The response will be a `412 Precondition Failed` error - the same as if the sync token had expired.\n\nSubsequent requests should always provide the sync token from the immediately preceding call.\n\nSync tokens may not be valid if you attempt to go \"backward\" in the history by requesting previous tokens, though re-requesting the current sync token is generally safe, and will always return the same results.\n\nWhen you receive a `412 Precondition Failed` error, it means that the sync token is either invalid or expired. If you are attempting to keep a set of data in sync, this signals you may need to re-crawl the data.\n\nSync tokens always expire after 24 hours, but may expire sooner, depending on load on the service.",

First, a simple HTTP POST\nrequest initiates the creation similar to creating any other resource.\n\nNext, in the middle of this request comes the confirmation handshake.\nWhen a webhook is created, we will send a test POST to the target with an\n`X-Hook-Secret` header. The target must respond with a `200 OK` or `204\nNo Content` and a matching `X-Hook-Secret` header to confirm that this\nwebhook subscription is indeed expected. We strongly recommend storing\nthis secret to be used to verify future webhook event signatures.\n\nThe POST request to create the webhook will then return with the status\nof the request. If you do not acknowledge the webhook’s confirmation\nhandshake it will fail to setup, and you will receive an error in\nresponse to your attempt to create it. This means you need to be able to\nreceive and complete the webhook *while* the POST request is in-flight\n(in other words, have a server that can handle requests asynchronously).\n\nInvalid hostnames like localhost will recieve a 403 Forbidden status code.\n\n```\n# Request\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer <personal_access_token>\" \\\n-X POST https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/webhooks \\\n-d \"resource=8675309\" \\\n-d \"target=https://example.com/receive-webhook/7654\"\n```\n\n```\n# Handshake sent to https://example.com/\nPOST /receive-webhook/7654\nX-Hook-Secret: b537207f20cbfa02357cf448134da559e8bd39d61597dcd5631b8012eae53e81\n```\n\n```\n# Handshake response sent by example.com\nHTTP/1.1 200\nX-Hook-Secret: b537207f20cbfa02357cf448134da559e8bd39d61597dcd5631b8012eae53e81\n```\n\n```\n# Response\nHTTP/1.1 201\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"gid\": \"43214\",\n    \"resource\": {\n      \"gid\": \"8675309\",\n      \"name\": \"Bugs\"\n    },\n    \"target\": \"https://example.com/receive-webhook/7654\",\n    \"active\": false,\n    \"last_success_at\": null,\n    \"last_failure_at\": null,\n    \"last_failure_content\": null\n  }\n}\n```",

Queries for events before this date will not return results.\n\nThere are a number of query parameters (below) that can be used to filter the set of [AuditLogEvent](/docs/audit-log-event) objects that are returned in the response. Any combination of query parameters is valid. When no filters are provided, all of the events that have been captured in your domain will match.\n\nThe list of events will always be [paginated](/docs/pagination). The default limit is 1000 events. The next set of events can be retrieved using the `offset` from the previous response. If there are no events that match the provided filters in your domain, the endpoint will return `null` for the `next_page` field. Querying again with the same filters may return new events if they were captured after the last request. Once a response includes a `next_page` with an `offset`, subsequent requests can be made with the latest `offset` to poll for new events that match the provided filters.\n\nWhen no `offset` is provided, the response will begin with the oldest events that match the provided filters. It is important to note that [AuditLogEvent](/docs/audit-log-event) objects will be permanently deleted from our systems after 90 days. If you wish to keep a permanent record of these events, we recommend using a SIEM tool to ingest and store these logs.",

        "description": "To mirror the functionality of the Asana web app's advanced search feature, the Asana API has a task search endpoint that allows you to build complex filters to find and retrieve the exact data you need.\n#### Premium access\nLike the Asana web product's advance search feature, this search endpoint will only be available to premium Asana users. A user is premium if any of the following is true:\n\n- The workspace in which the search is being performed is a premium workspace - The user is a member of a premium team inside the workspace\n\nEven if a user is only a member of a premium team inside a non-premium workspace, search will allow them to find data anywhere in the workspace, not just inside the premium team. Making a search request using credentials of a non-premium user will result in a `402 Payment Required` error.\n#### Pagination\nSearch results are not stable; repeating the same query multiple times may return the data in a different order, even if the data do not change. Because of this, the traditional [pagination](https://developers.asana.com/docs/#pagination) available elsewhere in the Asana API is not available here. However, you can paginate manually by sorting the search results by their creation time and then modifying each subsequent query to exclude data you have already seen. Page sizes are limited to a maximum of 100 items, and can be specified by the `limit` query parameter.\n#### Eventual consistency\nChanges in Asana (regardless of whether they’re made though the web product or the API) are forwarded to our search infrastructure to be indexed. This process can take between 10 and 60 seconds to complete under normal operation, and longer during some production incidents. Making a change to a task that would alter its presence in a particular search query will not be reflected immediately. This is also true of the advanced search feature in the web product.\n#### Rate limits\nYou may receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response if you hit any of our [rate limits](https://developers.asana.com/docs/#rate-limits).\n#### Custom field parameters\n| Parameter name | Custom field type | Accepted type |\n|---|---|---|\n| custom_fields.{gid}.is_set | All | Boolean |\n| custom_fields.{gid}.value | Text | String |\n| custom_fields.{gid}.value | Number | Number |\n| custom_fields.{gid}.value | Enum | Enum option ID |\n| custom_fields.{gid}.starts_with | Text only | String |\n| custom_fields.{gid}.ends_with | Text only | String |\n| custom_fields.{gid}.contains | Text only | String |\n| custom_fields.{gid}.less_than | Number only | Number |\n| custom_fields.{gid}.greater_than | Number only | Number |\n\n\nFor example, if the gid of the custom field is 12345, these query parameter to find tasks where it is set would be `custom_fields.12345.is_set=true`. To match an exact value for an enum custom field, use the gid of the desired enum option and not the name of the enum option: `custom_fields.12345.value=67890`.\n\n**Not Supported**: searching for multiple exact matches of a custom field, searching for multi-enum custom field\n\n*Note: If you specify `projects.any` and `sections.any`, you will receive tasks for the project **and** tasks for the section. If you're looking for only tasks in a section, omit the `projects.any` from the request.*",
