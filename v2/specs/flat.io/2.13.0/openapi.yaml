    The Flat API allows you to easily extend the abilities of the [Flat Platform](https://flat.io), with a wide range of use cases including the following:

    * Creating and importing new music scores using MusicXML, MIDI, Guitar Pro (GP3, GP4, GP5, GPX, GP), PowerTab, TuxGuitar and MuseScore files
    * Browsing, updating, copying, exporting the user's scores (for example in MP3, WAV or MIDI)
    * Managing educational resources with Flat for Education: creating & updating the organization accounts, the classes, rosters and assignments.

    The Flat API is built on HTTP. Our API is RESTful It has predictable resource URLs. It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors. It also accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.
    The [schema](/swagger.yaml) of this API follows the [OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) specification](https://www.openapis.org/), you can use and work with [compatible Swagger tools](http://swagger.io/open-source-integrations/).
    This API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in compliance with [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/).

    You can use your favorite HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Flat's API. This specification and reference is [available on Github](https://github.com/FlatIO/api-reference).

      Sheet music is the main API object type available for all Flat account.
      Here is a typical lifecycle for a music score document on Flat:
        - An end user can **create a music score** or **import a document** using our [web interface](https://flat.io) or a third-party website/app (e.g. Google Drive) using this API (see [`POST /v2/scores`](#operation/createScore). The creation and import of music scores can be done with this single API endpoint. This one currently supports the [MusicXML](http://www.musicxml.com/) (compressed or not) and [MIDI](https://www.midi.org/specifications).
        - **List scores**:
          - The **owned scores** can be listed using the [collections API methods](#tag/Collection), especially [`GET /collections/{collection}/scores`](#operation/listCollectionScores).
          - The scores from a public account can be listed with [`GET /users/{user}/scores`](#operation/getUserScores).
          - Scores shared with a specific group can be listed with [`GET /groups/{group}/scores`](#operation/getGroupScores).
        - The metadata of a single score can be retrieved with [`GET /scores/{score}`](#operation/getScore).
        - Scores on Flat have **one or multiple revisions**: creating a new score will create a first revision. These **revisions can be listed** using [`GET /scores/{score}/revisions`](#operation/getScoreRevisions) and a specific **revision data can be downloaded** with [`GET /scores/{score}/revisions/{revision}/{format}`](#operation/getScoreRevisionData). New revisions can be created using our [sheet music editor](https://flat.io) or using [`POST /scores/{score}/revisions`](#operation/createScoreRevision) (this endpoint has similar parameters than during the score creation). The last revision of a document may not directly reflect the really last version of a music score: recent modifications can be made offline or not yet consolidated into a new revision. In average, a new revision is created every 100 modifications made with our editor.
        - Scores can be **shared publicly** by changing the privacy option with [`POST /scores/{score}`](#operation/editScore), or **individually shared** using the different collaborators API endpoints (see [`POST /scores/{score}/collaborators`](#operation/addScoreCollaborator)).

      Collections let you organize your content in a Flat account. They work like a regular _folder_ with some specificities:
        - Our design goal here is to create a system similar to a _book_ or a _playlist of songs_.
        - Collections can't have children collections (except the `trash` and `sharedWithMe` that are special collections).
        - Any score can be added to one or multiple collections. For example, you can have a single private score in two or more collections, or add any public or shared scores to one of your collections.

      All the collections don't have the same capabilities. Capabilities depend on the `type` of collection and the `rights` you have on a collection. They are available when [listing the collection](#operation/listCollections) or [retrieving the collection details](#operation/getCollection).

      At this time, only `private` privacy mode is widely available. Privacy modes `public`, `organizationPublic` and `privateLink`, and 1:1 sharing will be available in an upcoming update later this year.

        Classrooms on Flat allow you to create activities with assignments and post content to a specific group.

        When creating a class, Flat automatically creates two groups: one for the teachers of the course, one for the students. The creator of this class is automatically added to the teachers group.

        If the classsroom is synchronized with another application like Google Classroom, some of the meta information will automatically be updated.

        You can add users to this class using `PUT /classes/{class}/users/{user}`, they will automatically added to the group based on their role on Flat. Users can also enroll themselves to this class using `POST /classes/enroll/{enrollmentCode}` and the `enrollmentCode` returned in the `ClassDetails` response.

        This method creates and sends invitation for teachers and admins.

        Invitations can only be used by new Flat users or users who are not part of the organization yet.

        If the email of the user is already associated to a user of your organization, the API will simply update the role of the existing user and won't send an invitation. In this case, the property `usedBy` will be directly filled with the uniquer identifier of the corresponding user.

        Use this API method to **create a new music score in the current User account**. You will need a MusicXML 3 (`vnd.recordare.musicxml` or `vnd.recordare.musicxml+xml`), a MIDI (`audio/midi`), Guitar Pro (GP3, GP4, GP5, GPX, GP), PowerTab, TuxGuitar, or MuseScore file to create the new Flat document.

        This API call will automatically create the first revision of the document, the score can be modified by the using our web application or by uploading a new revision of this file (`POST /v2/scores/{score}/revisions/{revision}`).

        The currently authenticated user will be granted owner of the file and will be able to add other collaborators (users and groups).

        If no `collection` is specified, the API will create the score in the most appropriate collection. This can be the `root` collection or a different collection based on the user's settings or API authentication method.
        If a `collection` is specified and this one has more public privacy settings than the score (e.g. `public` vs `private` for the score), the privacy settings of the created score will be adjusted to the collection ones.
        You can check the adjusted privacy settings in the returned score `privacy`, and optionally adjust these settings if needed using `PUT /scores/{score}`.

        This method can be used by the owner/admin (`aclAdmin` rights) of a score as well as regular collaborators.

        When called by an owner/admin, it will schedule the deletion of the score, its revisions, and complete history.
        The score won't be accessible anymore after calling this method and the user's quota will directly be updated.

        When called by a regular collaborator (`aclRead` / `aclWrite`), the score will be unshared (i.e. removed from the account & own collections).

        This API method allows you to change the metadata of a score document (e.g. its `title` or `privacy`), all the properties are optional.

        To edit the file itself, create a new revision using the appropriate method (`POST /v2/scores/{score}/revisions/{revision}`).

        When editing the `title`, `subtitle`, `composer`, `lyricist`, `arranger` or `licenseText`, the metadatas will be instantly be updated, and a real-time action will be pushed to update the document lazily.
        This pending document modification will be automatically be saved as a new version by either a connected client or our internal versioning service.

        - `private`: The score is private and can be only accessed, modified and administred by specified collaborators users.
        - `privateLink`: The score is private but can be accessed using a private link `htmlUrl` or the private key in the property `sharingKey`.
        - `organizationPublic`: _Available only with [Flat for Education](https://flat.io/edu)._ The score is public in the organization: users of the same organization can access to this one. The score can be modified and administred by specified collaborators users.

        The score can also be individually shared to a set of users or groups using the different collaborators API methods.

        When a file is synchronized from an external source (e.g. Google Drive) and the sharing options are changed on the source, Flat will chose the best privacy mode for the file.

        When using a [Flat for Education](https://flat.io/edu) account, some of the modes may not be available if disabled by an administrator of the organization (e.g. by default the `public` mode is not available).
