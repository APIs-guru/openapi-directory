    # Explore our APIs

    ## Get started

    1. [Sign up for GraphHopper](https://support.graphhopper.com/a/solutions/articles/44001976025)
    2. [Create an API key](https://support.graphhopper.com/a/solutions/articles/44001976027)

    Each API part has its own documentation. Jump to the desired API part and learn about the API through the given examples and tutorials.

    In addition, for each API there are specific sample requests that you can send via Insomnia or Postman to see what the requests and responses look like.

    ## Insomnia

    To explore our APIs with [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), follow these steps:

    1. Open Insomnia and Import [our workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graphhopper/directions-api-doc/master/web/restclients/GraphHopper-Direction-API-Insomnia.json).
    2. Specify [your API key](https://graphhopper.com/dashboard/#/register) in your workspace: Manage Environments -> Base Environment -> `"api_key": your API key`

    ![Postman](./img/postman.png)

    ## API Client Libraries

    To speed up development and make coding easier, we offer the following client libraries:

     * [JavaScript client](https://github.com/graphhopper/directions-api-js-client) - try the [live examples](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/examples/)
     * [Others](https://github.com/graphhopper/directions-api-clients) like C#, Ruby, PHP, Python, ... automatically created for the Route Optimization API

    ### Bandwidth reduction

    If you create your own client, make sure it supports http/2 and gzipped responses for best speed.

    If you use the Matrix, the Route Optimization API or the Cluster API and want to solve large problems, we recommend you to reduce bandwidth
    by [compressing your POST request](https://gist.github.com/karussell/82851e303ea7b3459b2dea01f18949f4)
    and specifying the header as follows: `Content-Encoding: gzip`. This will also avoid the HTTP 413 error "Request Entity Too Large".

    # Map Data and Routing Profiles

    Currently, our main data source is [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org). We also integrated other network data providers.
    This chapter gives an overview about the options you have.

    ## OpenStreetMap

    #### Geographical Coverage

    [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) covers the whole world. If you want to see for yourself if we can provide data suitable for your region,
    please visit [GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps/).
    You can edit and modify OpenStreetMap data if you find that important information is missing, e.g. a weight limit for a bridge.
    [Here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_guide) is a beginner's guide that shows how to add data. If you have edited data, we usually consider your data after 1 week at the latest.

    #### Supported Vehicle Profiles

    The Routing, Matrix and Route Optimization APIs support the following vehicle profiles:

    Name       | Description           | Restrictions              | Icon
    -----------|:----------------------|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------

    Please note:

     * all motor vehicles (`car`, `small_truck`, `truck` and `scooter`) support turn restrictions via `turn_costs=true`
     * the free package supports only the vehicle profiles `car`, `bike` or `foot`
     * up to 2 different vehicle profiles can be used in a single optimization request. The number of vehicles is unaffected and depends on your subscription.
     * we offer custom vehicle profiles with different properties, different speed profiles or different access options. To find out more about custom profiles, please [contact us](https://www.graphhopper.com/contact-form/).
     * a sophisticated `motorcycle` profile is available up on request. It is powered by the [Kurviger](https://kurviger.de/en) Routing API and favors curves and slopes while avoiding cities and highways.
     
    ## TomTom

    If you want to include traffic, you can purchase the TomTom Add-on.
    This Add-on only uses TomTom's road network and historical traffic information.
    Live traffic is not yet considered. If you are interested to learn how we consider traffic information, we recommend that you read [this article](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2017/11/06/time-dependent-optimization/).

    Please note the following:

     * Currently we only offer this for our [Route Optimization API](#tag/Route-Optimization-API).
     * In addition to our terms, you need to accept TomTom's [End User License Aggreement](https://www.graphhopper.com/tomtom-end-user-license-agreement/).

      ## Quickstart

      The Route Optimization API can be used to solve [traveling salesman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) or [vehicle routing problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem).
      Solve your first problem by following these steps. If you already have a GraphHopper account, start with step 2.

      1. [Sign up for GraphHopper](https://support.graphhopper.com/a/solutions/articles/44001976025)
      2. [Create an API key](https://support.graphhopper.com/a/solutions/articles/44001976027)
      3. Download [simple traveling salesman problem](https://gist.github.com/oblonski/fb2f2be534c3ebe7bebaa72151194182) and save it in a local folder
      4. Open your command line, go to that local folder and use cURL ([What is cURL?](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL)) as follows:

         ```
         curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json"   "https://graphhopper.com/api/1/vrp?key=YOUR_CREATED_API_KEY" --data "@tsp.json"
         ```

      Alternatively, you can use our Editor to explore that API:

      1. Login to your GraphHopper account
      2. Go to **Editor**
      3. Click the **Optimize** button to solve your first problem
      4. Analyze the solution on the **Map** or as raw **JSON Output**

      If you have successfully solved the first problem, we recommend this tutorial - [Getting Started with the Optimization API](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2019/05/17/getting-started-with-the-optimization-api-traveling-salesman-problem/).
      It shows and describes the essential elements to model your vehicle routing problem.

      To explore the full specification, we recommend that you either use our [route editor](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2015/07/21/graphhoppers-new-route-optimization-editor/),
      which you can find in our [dashboard](https://graphhopper.com/dashboard/),
      or use a REST client such as Insomnia or Postman, as described [here](https://docs.graphhopper.com/#section/Explore-our-APIs/Insomnia).

      ## Tutorials

      ### Introduction

      ![Routing screenshot](./img/routing-example.png)

      The Routing API is part of the GraphHopper Directions API. Routing is the process of finding the best path connecting
      two or more points, where the meaning of ''best'' depends on the vehicle and use case.

      ### Navigation
      If you plan to use the Routing API for navigation, have a look at our [open source demo navigation application](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-navigation-example) and adapt it to your needs.

      ### Fast
      To get started using this API, just provide two or more points and retrieve the fastest route through the road
      network that connects them. This type of request is heavily optimized for query performance, so it does not
      allow for some advanced features.
      ### Flexible
      Unlock further flexible features via `ch.disable=true`.
    name: Routing API

      ### Introduction

      ![Matrix Example](./img/matrix-example.png)

      The Matrix API is part of the [GraphHopper Directions API](https://graphhopper.com/#directions-api) and with
      it you can calculate many-to-many distances and times a lot more efficient than calling the
      Routing API multiple times.

      In the [Routing API](#tag/Routing-API) we support multiple points, so called 'via points', which results in one
      route being calculated. The Matrix API results in NxM routes, or more precise NxM distances or times being calculated
      but [is a lot faster](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2019/06/04/incredibly-fast-distance-matrix-calculations-with-graphhopper/)
      compared to NxM single requests.

      The most simple example is a tourist trying to decide
      which pizza is close to her instead of using beeline distance she can calculate a 1x4 matrix. Or a delivery service
      often in the need of big NxN matrices to solve vehicle routing problems. For example the [GraphHopper Route Optimization API](#tag/Route-Optimization-API)
      uses the Matrix API under the hood to achieve this.

      Some other use cases for the Matrix API:

      * Logistic problems often pick up many items from and deliver them to many locations.
      * Calculating detours with many possible points in-between and selecting the best e.g. interesting for ridesharing or taxi applications. For this 1-to-many requests are necessary.
      * Finding the best tour for a tourist in the need to visit as many points of interests as possible.
      * ...

      ### API Clients and Examples

      See the [clients](#section/API-Clients) section in the main document and [live examples](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/examples/#matrix).

      ### Description

      The Matrix API calculates the well known distance-matrix for a set of points, i.e. it calculates all the distances
      between every point combination. But we do not stop there, we also offer a time-, weight- and route-matrix.
      The weight-matrix can be used as raw input for e.g. a vehicle routing problem ([VRP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem))
      and is more precise than a time- or distance-matrix. E.g. for bike routes the actual weight of a route (e.g. the "beauty")
      is what you want to decide if a route is 'better' and not always the taken time or distance.

      A simple illustration for a 3x3 matrix with identical from and to points:

      -          |to_point1|to_point2|to_point3
      :-----------|:--------|:--------|:--------
      from_point1 |0        |1->2     | 1->3
      from_point2 |2->1     |0        | 2->3
      from_point3 |3->1     |3->2     | 0

      A simple illustration for a 1x3 matrix with different start- and end-points:

      -          | to_point1  | to_point2 | t_point3
      :-----------|:-----------|:----------|:--------
      from_pointA |A->1        |A->2       |A->3


      For every route 1->2, 1-3, ... or A->1,A->2,A->3 you can return only the weight, the time and the distance.
      To calculate full routes you can use the [Routing API](#tag/Routing-API).

      ### Limits and Counts

      The cost for one request depends on the number of locations and is documented [here](https://support.graphhopper.com/support/solutions/44000303787#what-is-one-credit).

      One request should not exceed the Matrix API location limit, which depends on the subscription, see the
      pricing tab in our dashboard.

      ### Introduction

      ![Cluster Example](./img/cluster-solution.jpg)

      It solves the “capacity clustering problem” by assigning a set of customers to a given number of distinct groups (called clusters).
      The API “clusters” by minimizing the total distance from each individual customer to its designated group median.
      It can also consider minimum and maximum capacity restrictions for each group.

      Clustering can be used in many practical applications.
      For example, it can help to plan territories, i.e. territory optimization for field teams with large territories for field workers,
      or to solve large vehicle routing problems (VRP).

        The Cluster endpoint is used with a POST request towards
        `https://graphhopper.com/api/1/cluster?key=<your_key>`. The solution will be provided in the JSON response.
        Please note that for problems that take longer than 10 seconds a bad request error is returned.
        In this case please use the asynchronous [Batch Cluster Endpoint](#operation/asyncClusteringProblem) instead.

        ### Introduction

        ![Geocoding Example](./img/geocoding-example.png)

        _Geocoding_ describes the process of transforming an textual address representation to a coordinate (`latitude,longitude`).
        For example the conversion from `Berlin` to `52.5170365,13.3888599`.

        _Reverse geocoding_ converts a coordinate to a textual address representation or place name. Find out more about Geocoding itself on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding).

            The provider parameter is currently under development and can fall back to `default` at any time.
            The intend is to provide alternatives to our default geocoder. Each provider has its own strenghts and might fit better for certain scenarios, so it's worth to compare the different providers.
            To try it append the `provider`parameter to the URL like `&provider=nominatim`,
            the result structure should be identical in all cases - if not, please report this back to us.
            Keep in mind that some providers do not support certain parameters or don't return some fields, for example `osm_id` and `osm_type` are not supported by every geocoding provider.
            If you would like to use additional parameters of one of the providers, but it's not available for the GraphHopper Geocoding API, yet? Please contact us.

            The credit costs can be different for all providers - see [here](https://support.graphhopper.com/support/solutions/articles/44000718211-what-is-one-credit-) for more information about it.

            Currently, only the default provider and gisgraphy supports autocompletion of partial search strings.

            All providers support normal "forward" geocoding and reverse geocoding via `reverse=true`.

            #### Default (`provider=default`)

            This provider returns results of our internal geocoding engine, as described above.
            In addition to the above documented parameters the following parameters are possible:
            * `bbox` - the expected format is `minLon,minLat,maxLon,maxLat`
            * `osm_tag` - you can filter `key:value` or exclude places with certain OpenStreetMap tags `!key:value`. E.g. `osm_tag=tourism:museum` or just the key `osm_tag=tourism`. To exclude multiple tags you add multiple `osm_tag` parameters.

            #### Nominatim (`provider=nominatim`)

            The GraphHopper Directions API uses a commercially hosted Nominatim geocoder. You can try this provider [here](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/). The provider does **not** fall under the [restrictions](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/) of the Nominatim instance hosted by OpenStreetMap.

            In addition to the above documented parameters Nominatim allows to use the following parameters, which can be used as documented [here](https://github.com/openstreetmap/Nominatim/blob/master/docs/api/Search.md#parameters):

            * `viewbox` - the expected format is `minLon,minLat,maxLon,maxLat`
            * `bounded` - If 1 and a viewbox is given, restrict the result to items contained within that viewbox. Default is 0.

            #### Gisgraphy (`provider=gisgraphy`)

            This provider returns results from the Gisgraphy geocoder which you can try [here](https://services.gisgraphy.com/static/leaflet/index.html).

            **Limitations:** The `locale` parameter is not supported. Gisgraphy does not return OSM tags or an extent.

            Gisgraphy has a special autocomplete API, which you can use by adding `autocomplete=true` (does not work with `reverse=true`). The autocomplete API is optimized on predicting text input, but returns less information.

            In addition to the above documented parameters Gisgraphy allows to use the following parameters, which can be used as documented [here](https://www.gisgraphy.com/documentation/user-guide.php#geocodingservice):

            * `radius` - radius in meters
            * `country` - restrict search for the specified country. The value must be the ISO 3166 Alpha 2 code of the country.

            #### NetToolKit (`provider=nettoolkit`)

            This provider returns results from the NetToolKit provider which is specialized for US addresses and provides a wrapper around Nominatim for other addresses. You can try it [here](https://www.nettoolkit.com/geo/demo).

            The following additional NetToolKit parameters are supported (read [here](https://www.nettoolkit.com/docs/geo/geocoding) for more details):
            - `source`: User can choose which source provider to geocode the address, this value is "NetToolKit" by default
            - `country_code`: an iso-3166-2 country code (e.g : US) filter the results to the specify country code

            **Limitations:** NetToolKit does not support the `locale` parameter. NetToolKit does not return OSM tags (e.g. osm_id, osm_type, osm_value).

            #### OpenCage Data (`provider=opencagedata`)

            This provider returns results from the OpenCageData geocoder which you can try [here](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/demo).

            In addition to the above documented parameters OpenCage Data allows to use the following parameters, which can be used as documented [here](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/api#forward-opt):

            * countrycode - The country code is a two letter code as defined by the ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2 standard. E.g. gb for the United Kingdom, fr for France, us for United States. 
            * bounds - the expected format is `minLon,minLat,maxLon,maxLat`

        ```

        Don't forget to replace the placeholder with your own key.

        ### Introduction
        ![Isochrone screenshot](./img/isochrone-example.png)

        An isochrone of a location is ''a line connecting points at which a vehicle arrives at the same time'', see Wikipedia.
        With the same API you can also calculate isodistances, just use the parameter distance_limit instead of time_limit`.

        ### Use Cases
        Some possible areas in which this API may be useful to you:

        - real estate analysis
        - realtors
        - vehicle scheduling
        - geomarketing
        - reach of electric vehicles
        - transport planning
        - logistics (distribution and retail network planning)

        ```

        A minimal working GPX file looks like
        ```gpx
        <gpx>
         <trk>
          <trkseg>
           <trkpt lat="51.343657" lon="12.360708"></trkpt>
           <trkpt lat="51.343796" lon="12.361337"></trkpt>
           <trkpt lat="51.342784" lon="12.361882"></trkpt>
          </trkseg>
         </trk>
        </gpx>
        ```

        ### Introduction
        ![Map Matching screenshot](./img/map-matching-example.gif)

        The Map Matching API is part of the GraphHopper Directions API and with this API you can snap measured GPS points typically as GPX files to a digital
        road network to e.g. clean data or attach certain data like elevation or turn instructions to it. Read more at Wikipedia.

        In the example screenshot above and demo you see the Map Matching API in action where the black line is the GPS track and the green one is matched result.

        Most of the times, you can simply POST a GPX file, but some of the request parameters of the [Routing API](#tag/Routing-API) apply here, too.

        ### API Clients and Examples
        See the [clients](#section/API-Clients) section in the main documentation, and [live examples](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/examples/#map-matching).

        ### Limits and Counts
        The cost for one request depends on the number of GPS location and is documented [here](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/docs/FAQ/).

        One request should not exceed the Map Matching API location limit depending on the package, see the pricing in our dashboard.

        prefer using the [POST Matrix Endpoint](#operation/postMatrix) that avoids problems with many locations
        and can also gzip the **request**. (Note, that all endpoints return gzipped responses).

      parameters:
        - description: Specify multiple points in `latitude,longitude` for which the weight-, route-, time- or distance-matrix should be calculated. In this case the starts are identical to the destinations. If there are N points, then NxN entries will be calculated. The order of the point parameter is important. Specify at least three points. Cannot be used together with from_point or to_point.

        The [GET endpoint](#operation/getMatrix) has an URL length limitation, which hurts for many locations per request.
        In those cases use this POST endpoint with a JSON as input. The only parameter in the URL will be the key.
        Both request scenarios are identical except that all singular parameter names are named as their plural for a POST request.
        The effected parameters are: `points`, `from_points`, `to_points`, and `out_arrays`. For the remaining parameters
        please refer to the [guide of the GET endpoint](#operation/getMatrix).

        **Please note that in contrast to GET endpoint the points have to be specified as `[longitude, latitude]` array (in that order, similar to [GeoJson](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#examples))**.

        For example the query `point=10,11&point=20,22&vehicle=car` will be converted to the following JSON:
        ```json
        { "points": [[11,10], [22,20]], "vehicle": "car" }
        ```

        A complete curl Example:
        ```bash
        curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://graphhopper.com/api/1/matrix?key=[YOUR_KEY]" -d '{"elevation":false,"out_arrays":["weights", "times"],"from_points":[[-0.087891,51.534377],[-0.090637,51.467697],[-0.171833,51.521241],[-0.211487,51.473685]],"to_points":[[-0.087891,51.534377],[-0.090637,51.467697],[-0.171833,51.521241],[-0.211487,51.473685]],"vehicle":"car"}'

        Prefer the [synchronous endpoint](#operation/postMatrix) and use this Batch endpoint for long running problems only.

        The Batch Matrix endpoint allows using matrices with more locations and works asynchronously - similar to the [Batch Route Optimization endpoint](#operation/asyncVRP):
         * Create a HTTP POST request against `/matrix/calculate` and add the key in the URL: `/matrix/calculate?key=[YOUR_KEY]`. This will give you the `job_id` from the response json like `{ "job_id": "7ac65787-fb99-4e02-a832-2c3010c70097" }`
         * Poll via HTTP GET requests every 500ms against `/matrix/solution/[job_id]`

        Here are some full examples via curl:
        ```bash
        $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://graphhopper.com/api/1/matrix/calculate?key=[YOUR_KEY]" -d '{"points":[[13.29895,52.48696],[13.370876,52.489575],[13.439026,52.511206]]}'
        {"job_id":"7ac65787-fb99-4e02-a832-2c3010c70097"}
        ```

        Pick the returned `job_id` and use it in the next GET requests:
        ```bash
        $ curl -X GET "https://graphhopper.com/api/1/matrix/solution/7ac65787-fb99-4e02-a832-2c3010c70097?key=[YOUR_KEY]"
        {"status":"waiting"}
        ```

        When the calculation is finished (`status:finished`) the JSON response will contain the full matrix JSON under `solution`:
        ```bash
        $ curl -X GET "https://graphhopper.com/api/1/matrix/solution/7ac65787-fb99-4e02-a832-2c3010c70097?key=[YOUR_KEY]"
        {"solution":{"weights":[[0.0,470.453,945.414],[503.793,0.0,580.871],[970.49,569.511,0.0]],"info":{"copyrights":["GraphHopper","OpenStreetMap contributors"]}},"status":"finished"}
        ```

        Please note that if an error occured while calculation the JSON will not have a status but contain directly the error message e.g.:
        ```json
        {"message":"Cannot find from_points: 1"}
        ```
        And the optional `hints` array.

            Rather than looking for the shortest or fastest path, this parameter lets you solve two different problems related to routing:
            With `alternative_route`, we give you not one but several routes that are close to optimal, but
            not too similar to each other. 
            With `round_trip`, the route will get you back to where you started. This is meant for fun (think of
            a bike trip), so we will add some randomness. The `round_trip` option requires `ch.disable=true`.

        Please see the [GET endpoint](#operation/getRoute) for a simpler method on how to get started.
        If you are familiar with POST requests and JSON then do not hesitate to continue here.

        Especially when you use many locations you should get familiar with this POST endpoint as the GET endpoint
        has an URL length limitation. Additionally the request of this POST endpoint can be compressed and can slightly
        speed up the request.

        To do a request you send JSON data. Both request scenarios GET and POST are identical except that all singular parameter names are named as their plural for a POST request.
        The effected parameters are: `points`, `point_hints` and `snap_preventions`.

        **Please note that in opposite to the GET endpoint, points are specified in the order of `longitude, latitude`**.

        For example `point=10,11&point=20,22` will be converted to the `points` array (plural):
        ```json
        { "points": [[11,10], [22,20]] }
        ```
        Note again that also the order changes from `[latitude,longitude]` to `[longitude,latitude]`
        similar to [GeoJson](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#examples).

        Example:
        ```bash
        curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://graphhopper.com/api/1/route?key=[YOUR_KEY]" -d '{"elevation":false,"points":[[-0.087891,51.534377],[-0.090637,51.467697]],"vehicle":"car"}'

        To get started with the Route Optimization API, please read the [introduction](#tag/Route-Optimization-API).

        To solve a new vehicle routing problem, make a HTTP POST to this URL

        ```
        https://graphhopper.com/api/1/vrp?key=<your_key>
        ```

        It returns the solution to this problem in the JSON response.

        Please note that this URL is very well suited to solve minor problems.
        Larger vehicle routing problems, which take longer than 10 seconds to solve, cannot be solved.
        To solve them, please use the [batch mode URL](#operation/asyncVRP) instead.

        To solve a vehicle routing problem, perform the following steps:

        1.) Make a HTTP POST to this URL

        ```
        https://graphhopper.com/api/1/vrp/optimize?key=<your_key>
        ```

        It returns a job id (job_id).

        2.) Take the job id and fetch the solution for the vehicle routing problem from this URL:

        ```
        https://graphhopper.com/api/1/vrp/solution/<job_id>?key=<your_key>
        ```

        We recommend to query the solution every 500ms until it returns 'status=finished'.

        **Note**: Since the workflow is a bit more cumbersome and since you lose some time in fetching the solution, you should always prefer
        the [synchronous endpoint](#operation/solveVRP). You should use the batch mode only for long running problems.

            Specifies the type of relation. It must be either of type `in_same_route`, `in_sequence` or `in_direct_sequence`.

            `in_same_route`: As the name suggest, it enforces the specified services or shipments to be in the same route. It can be specified as follows:

            ```json
            {
               "type": "in_same_route",
               "ids": ["serv_i_id","serv_j_id"]
            }
            ```

            This enforces service i to be in the same route as service j no matter which vehicle will be employed. If a specific vehicle (driver) is required to conduct this, just add a `vehicle_id` like this:

            ```
            {
               "type": "in_same_route",
               "ids": ["serv_i_id","serv_j_id"],
               "vehicle_id": "vehicle1"
            }
            ```

            This not only enforce service i and j to be in the same route, but also makes sure that both services are in the route of `vehicle1`.

            *Tip*: This way initial loads and vehicle routes can be modelled. For example, if your vehicles are already on the road and new orders come in, then vehicles can still be rescheduled subject to the orders that have already been assigned to these vehicles.



            `in_sequence`: This relation type enforces n jobs to be in sequence. It can be specified as

            ```json
            {
               "type": "in_sequence",
               "ids": ["serv_i_id","serv_j_id"]
            }
            ```

            which means that service j need to be in the same route as service i AND it needs to occur somewhere after service i. As described above if a specific vehicle needs to conduct this, just add `vehicle_id`.


            `in_direct_sequence`: This enforces n services or shipments to be in direct sequence. It can be specified as

            ```json
            {
               "type": "in_direct_sequence",
               "ids": ["serv_i_id","serv_j_id","serv_k_id"]
            }
            ```

            yielding service j to occur directly after service i, and service k to occur directly after service j i.e. in strong order. Again, a vehicle can be assigned a priority by adding a `vehicle_id` to the relation.


            *Special IDs*:
            If you look at the previous example and you want service i to be the first in the route, use the special ID `start` as follows:

            ```json
            {
               "type": "in_direct_sequence",
               "ids": ["start","serv_i_id","serv_j_id","serv_k_id"]
            }
            ```

            Latter enforces the direct sequence of i, j and k at the beginning of the route. If this sequence should be bound to the end of the route, use the special ID `end` like this:

            ```json
            {
               "type": "in_direct_sequence",
               "ids": ["serv_i_id","service_j_id","serv_k_id","end"]
            }
            ```

            If you deal with services then you need to use the 'id' of your services in the field 'ids'. To also consider sequences of the pickups and deliveries of your shipments, you need to use a special ID, i.e. use the shipment id plus the keyword `_pickup` or `_delivery`. For example, to ensure that the pickup and delivery of the shipment with the id 'my_shipment' are direct neighbors, you need the following specification:

            ```
            {
               "type": "in_direct_sequence",
               "ids": ["my_ship_pickup","my_ship_delivery"]
            }
            ```

    Objective:
      example:
        type: min
        value: vehicles
      properties:
        type:
          default: min
          description: |
            Type of objective function, i.e. `min` or `min-max`.

             * `min`: Minimizes the objective value.
             * `min-max`: Minimizes the maximum objective value.

            For instance, `min` -> `vehicles` minimizes the number of employed vehicles.
            `min` -> `completion_time` minimizes the sum of your vehicle routes' completion time.

            If you use, for example, `min-max` -> `completion_time`, it minimizes the maximum of your vehicle routes' completion time, i.e. it minimizes the overall makespan.
            This only makes sense if you have more than one vehicle. In case of one vehicle, switching from `min` to `min-max` should not have any impact.
            If you have more than one vehicle, then the algorithm tries to constantly move stops from one vehicle to another such that
            the completion time of longest vehicle route can be further reduced. For example, if you have one vehicle that takes 8 hours
            to serve all customers, adding another vehicle (and using `min-max`) might halve the time to serve all customers to 4 hours. However,
            this usually comes with higher transport costs.

            If you want to minimize `vehicles` first and, second, `completion_time`, you can also combine different objectives like this:

            ```json
            "objectives" : [
               {
                  "type": "min",
                  "value": "vehicles"
               },
               {
                  "type": "min",
                  "value": "completion_time"
               }
            ]
            ```

            If you want to balance activities or the number of stops among all employed drivers, you need to specify it as follows:

            ```json
            "objectives" : [
               {
                  "type": "min-max",
                  "value": "completion_time"
               },
               {
                  "type": "min-max",
                  "value": "activities"
               }
            ]
            ```
          enum:
            - min
            - min-max
          type: string
        value:
          default: transport_time
          description: |
            The value of the objective function.
            The objective value `transport_time` solely considers the time
            your drivers spend on the road, i.e. transport time. In contrary to `transport_time`, `completion_time` also takes waiting times at customer sites into account.
            The `completion_time` of a route is defined as the time from starting to ending the route,
            i.e. the route's transport time, the sum of waiting times plus the sum of activity durations.
            Note that choosing `transport_time` or `completion_time` only makes a difference if you specified time windows for your services/shipments since only in
            scenarios with time windows waiting times can occur.
            The objective value `vehicles` can only be used along with `min` and minimizes vehicles.

          description: |
            Rather than looking for the shortest or fastest path, this lets you solve two different problems related to routing:
            With `round_trip`, the route will get you back to where you started. This is meant for fun (think of
            a bike trip), so we will add some randomness. This requires `ch.disable=true`.
            With `alternative_route`, we give you not one but several routes that are close to optimal, but
            not too similar to each other. You can control both of these features with additional parameters, see below.
          enum:
            - round_trip
            - alternative_route
          type: string
        alternative_route.max_paths:
          default: 2
          description: |
            If `algorithm=alternative_route`, this parameter sets the number of maximum paths which should be calculated. Increasing can lead to worse alternatives.
          format: int32
          type: integer
        alternative_route.max_share_factor:
          default: 0.6
          description: |
            If `algorithm=alternative_route`, this parameter specifies how similar an alternative route can be to the optimal route. Increasing can lead to worse alternatives.
          type: number
        alternative_route.max_weight_factor:
          default: 1.4
          description: |
            If `algorithm=alternative_route`, this parameter sets the factor by which the alternatives routes can be longer than the optimal route. Increasing can lead to worse alternatives.
          type: number
        avoid:
          description: |
            Specify which road classes and environments you would like to avoid.
            Possible values are `motorway`, `steps`, `track`, `toll`, `ferry`, `tunnel` and `bridge`.
            Separate several values with `;`. Obviously not all the values make sense for all vehicle profiles e.g. `bike` is already forbidden on a `motorway`. Requires `ch.disable=true`.

            This changes the format of the `points` and `snapped_waypoints` fields of the response, in both their

        headings:
          description: |
            Favour a heading direction for a certain point. Specify either one heading for the start point or as many as there are points.
            In this case headings are associated by their order to the specific points. Headings are given as north based clockwise angle between 0 and 360 degree.
            This parameter also influences the tour generated with `algorithm=round_trip` and forces the initial direction.  Requires `ch.disable=true`.

          description: |
            Normally, the calculated route will visit the points in the order you specified them.
            If you have more than two points, you can set this parameter to `"true"` and the points may be re-ordered to minimize the total travel time.
            Keep in mind that the limits on the number of locations of the Route Optimization API applies, and the request costs more credits.
