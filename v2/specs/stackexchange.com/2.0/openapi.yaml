            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

  /badges:
    get:

        Returns all the badges in the system.
         
        Badge sorts are a tad complicated. For the purposes of sorting (and min/max) tag_based is considered to be greater than named.
         
        This means that you can get a list of all tag based badges by passing min=tag_based, and conversely all the named badges by passing max=named, with sort=type.
         
        For ranks, bronze is greater than silver which is greater than gold. Along with sort=rank, set max=gold for just gold badges, max=silver&min=silver for just silver, and min=bronze for just bronze.
         
        rank is the default sort.
         
        This method returns a list of badges.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

        Badge sorts are a tad complicated. For the purposes of sorting (and min/max) tag_based is considered to be greater than named.
         
        This means that you can get a list of all tag based badges by passing min=tag_based, and conversely all the named badges by passing max=named, with sort=type.
         
        For ranks, bronze is greater than silver which is greater than gold. Along with sort=rank, set max=gold for just gold badges, max=silver&min=silver for just silver, and min=bronze for just bronze.
         
        rank is the default sort.
         
        {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for badge_id on badge objects.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

      description: |
        Gets all the questions on the site.
         
        This method allows you make fairly flexible queries across the entire corpus of questions on a site. For example, getting all questions asked in the the week of Jan 1st 2011 with scores of 10 or more is a single query with parameters sort=votes&min=10&fromdate=1293840000&todate=1294444800.
         
        To constrain questions returned to those with a set of tags, use the tagged parameter with a semi-colon delimited list of tags. This is an and contraint, passing tagged=c;java will return only those questions with both tags. As such, passing more than 5 tags will always return zero results.
         
        The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:
         - activity - last_activity_date
         - creation - creation_date
         - votes - score
         - hot - by the formula ordering the hot tab Does not accept min or max
         - week - by the formula ordering the week tab Does not accept min or max
         - month - by the formula ordering the month tab Does not accept min or max
          activity is the default sort.
         
         It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.

         
        This method returns a list of questions.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

        Returns questions that the site considers related to those identified in {ids}.
         
        The algorithm for determining if questions are related is not documented, and subject to change at any time. Futhermore, these values are very heavily cached, and may not update immediately after a question has been editted. It is also not guaranteed that a question will be considered related to any number (even non-zero) of questions, and a consumer should be able to handle a variable number of returned questions.
         
        {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for question_id on question objects.
         
        The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:
         - activity - last_activity_date
         - creation - creation_date
         - votes - score
         - rank - a priority sort by site applies, subject to change at any time Does not accept min or max
          activity is the default sort.
         
         It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in.

        Returns questions which are similar to a hypothetical one based on a title and tag combination.
         
        This method is roughly equivalent to a site's related questions suggestion on the ask page.
         
        This method is useful for correlating data outside of a Stack Exchange site with similar content within one.
         
        Note that title must always be passed as a parameter. tagged and nottagged are optional, semi-colon delimited lists of tags.
         
        If tagged is passed it is treated as a preference, there is no guarantee that questions returned will have any of those tags. nottagged is treated as a requirement, no questions will be returned with those tags.
         
        The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:
         - activity - last_activity_date
         - creation - creation_date
         - votes - score
         - relevance - order by "how similar" the questions are, most likely candidate first with a descending order Does not accept min or max
          activity is the default sort.
         
         It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

        The inname parameter lets consumers filter the results down to just those users with a certain substring in their display name. For example, inname=kevin will return all users with both users named simply "Kevin" or those with Kevin as one of (or part of) their names; such as "Kevin Montrose".

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            #Discussion

            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.

            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).

            #Safety

            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).

            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            #Built In Filters

            The following filters are built in:

            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
            none, which is empty
            total, which includes just .total

            #Compatibility with V1.x

            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

      description: |
        The Stack Exchange API offers user authentication via OAuth 2.0, specifically templated after Facebook's implementation. There are two flows, an explicit grant for server side applications and an implicit one for pure browser based ones.

        #The explicit OAuth 2.0 flow consists of the following steps:
        1. Send a user to https://stackexchange.com/oauth, with these query string parameters
        - client_id
        - scope
        - redirect_uri - must be under an apps registered domain
        - state - optional
        2. The user approves your app
        3. The user is redirected to redirect_uri, with these query string parameters
        - code
        - state - optional, only returned if provided in the first step
        4. POST (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) the following parameters to https://stackexchange.com/oauth/access_token
        - client_id
        - client_secret
        - code - from the previous step
        - redirect_uri - must be the same as the provided in the first step
        This request is responded to with either an error (HTTP status code 400) or an access token of the form access_token=...&expires=1234. expires will only be set if scope does not include no_expiry, the use of which is strongly advised against unless your app truly needs perpetual access.

        #The implicit OAuth 2.0 flow consists of the following steps:

        1. Open a new window at https://stackexchange.com/oauth/dialog, with these query string parameters
        - client_id
        - scope (details)
        - redirect_uri - must be under an apps registered domain
        - state - optional
        2. The user approves your app
        3. The user is redirected to redirect_uri, with these parameters in the hash
        - access_token
        - expires - optional, only if scope doesn't contain no_expiry
        The explicit flow should be used by server-side applications, with special care taken to never leak client_secret. Client side applications should use the implicit flow.

        Once you have authenticated a user once, regardless of flow, subsequent re-authorizations will occur without requiring user action. Naturally, should a user revoke an applications permissions then further action will be required to re-authorize.

        Applications using the implicit flow can make use of our provided minimalistic Javascript SDK.

        #Scope

        With an empty scope, authentication will only allow an application to identify a user via the /me method. In order to access other information, different scope values must be sent. Multiple values may be sent in scope by comma or space delimitting them.

        - read_inbox - access a user's global inbox
        - no_expiry - access_token's with this scope do not expire
        - write_access - perform write operations as a user 2.1
        - private_info - access full history of a user's private actions on the site 2.1

        #Desktop Applications

        Desktop applications cannot participate directly in OAuth 2.0 flows, however the embeddable browser controls available in most frameworks make it possible to work around this limitation.

        Desktop applications should use the implicit client-side flow, hosting the process within a browser control. For redirect_uri, a value of https://stackexchange.com/oauth/login_success should be used. Upon a successful authentication, access_token will be placed in the url hash as with a standard implicit authentication.

        #Usage

        Access tokens can be passed (as access_token) to any method to grant applications an increased throttle quota. When passing an access token an app must pass its request key as well, if you don't have a request key you can obtain one by registering your application on Stack Apps (http://stackapps.com/users/login?returnurl=/apps/oauth/register).
      flows:
        implicit:
          authorizationUrl: https://stackexchange.com/oauth
          scopes: {}
      type: oauth2
