    Our atmosphere protects us from a hostile space radiation environment comprising high energy particles of solar and intergalactic origin. Solar radiation is significant during unpredictable and short lived solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs); however, galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) is omnipresent. The GCR intensity varies with latitude, longitude, and time due to effects of solar activity on the interplanetary magnetic field, as well as the Earth's magnetic field. Space radiation collides with gases in the atmosphere, leading to a complex shower of high energy radiation, the intensity and composition of which varies spatially and temporally. Excessive exposure to radiation can damage DNA and lead to long-term health effects such as an increased risk of cancer.  <br><br> Resulting radiation levels at commercial aircraft altitudes are greater than at sea level. Aircrew are classified as radiation workers in some countries; however, planning to limit their exposure, and monitoring, is generally lacking. Both real-time measurements and predictive models of radiation in the atmosphere are important to mitigate the radiation risk to crew. <br><br>
    We host a RESTful API to models of cosmic ray induced ionising radiation in the atmosphere. 
    The CARI7 and PARMA endpoints use models developed by the US Federal Aviation Administration and the Japan Atomic Energy Agency to  calculate cosmic radiation doses at a point. 
    The Route Dose API calculates the same quantities along a great circle route between two airports using CARI7. <br><br>
    API requests must contain a key "API-Key" in the header (see code samples). Obtain a key from  <a href='https://developer.amentum.io'>here</a>. <br><br>

      Developed by the US Federal Aviation Administration's  Civil Aerospace Medical Institute, CARI7 calculates cosmic  ray doses in the atmosphere. See <a href="https://academic.oup.com/rpd/article/175/4/419/2884614">here</a> for a complete description of  CARI-7. The original source code and Terms and Conditions can be found <a href="https://www.faa.gov/data_research/research/med_humanfacs/aeromedical/radiobiology/cari7/">here</a><br><br> <br><br> Note: The dose is considered a monthly average. It accounts for for heliocentric potential modulation only, minor geomagnetic storm and forbush decreases are ignored.

      The Route Dose API estimates radiation doses along a flight route between two airports with known ICAO or IATA codes or coordinates as latitude/longitude. Waypoints are calculated assuming a great circle  route, and either a constant altitude (in kilometers) and a flight duration (in hours) or lists of altitudes and cruising times to define a step climb.  Dose rates are then calculated at each waypoint using CARI-7.  The dose rate profile is integrated along the route to obtain the total dose for the flight. <br><br> Note: Dose is considered a monthly average accounting for heliocentric potential (HP) modulation only, minor geomagnetic storm and forbush decrease corrections are ignored. The calculation relies on HP data from the US Federal Aviation Administration that is released monthly. Doses can be calculated on the current date and short-range forecasting  of several weeks is supported (the exact forecast horizon depends on the release date of the FAA data).

      The PARMA model was developed by the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) and estimates fluxes of neutrons, protons, ions, muons, electrons, positrons, and photons on a given date, latitude, longitude, and altitude. A comprehensive description of PARMA can be found in the publications <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0160390">here</a> and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0144679">here</a>.<br><br> <br><br> Note: the PARMA API only accounts for heliocentric potential modulation, minor geomagnetic storm and forbush decreases are ignored.

        The ambient dose equivalent, H*(10), is an operational quantity that simulates the  human body by measuring the dose equivalent at a depth of 10 mm within a tissue  equivalent sphere of 300 mm diameter. It is a measurable quantity that is  used to calibrate area monitors (radiation detectors) for mixed radiation fields. 
        Use this endpoint if you are comparing model predictions to measurements.

        The ambient dose equivalent, H*(10), is an operational quantity that simulates the  human body by measuring the dose equivalent at a depth of 10 mm within a tissue  equivalent sphere of 300 mm diameter. It is a measurable quantity that is  used to calibrate area monitors (radiation detectors) for mixed radiation fields. 
        Use this endpoint if you are comparing model predictions to measurements.

        Effective dose is a radiation protection quantity defined by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and represents the stochastic health risk to the human body at low levels of radiation. It accounts for the different sensitivities of organs to ionising radiation, as well as the different effectiveness of various types of radiation.
