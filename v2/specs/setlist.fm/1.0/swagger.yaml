    <p>
    The setlist.fm API has been designed to give you easy access to setlist data in order to build fancy websites and
    other applications. Before starting to use the API, be sure to ...
    <ol>
    <li>... understand how setlist.fm works (the <a href="https://www.setlist.fm/faq">FAQ</a> and the
    <a href="https://www.setlist.fm/guidelines">Guidelines</a> are a good starting point),</li>
    <li>... read this documentation carefully and</li>
    <li>... <a href="https://www.setlist.fm/settings/api">apply for an API key</a> (link for logged in users only) - if
    you're no registered user yet, then <a href="https://www.setlist.fm/signup">register first</a> (it's free).</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
    If this documentation isn't enough or if you've got other things you'd like to tell us about the API, visit the
    <a href="https://www.setlist.fm/forum/setlistfm/setlistfm-api">API Forum</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Note that the setlist.fm API is, according to the <a href="https://www.setlist.fm/help/api-terms">API terms of
    service</a>, only free for non-commercial projects. If you're interested in using the API for commercial purposes,

    <h2>About this Service</h2>
    <p>
    This service provides methods to get both setlists and components of setlists such as artists, cities, countries or
    venues.
    </p>

    <h2>Supported Content Types</h2>
    <p>
    The REST service currently supports XML (default) and JSON content.
    </p>
    <p>
    To receive a JSON response, set the <code>Accept</code>
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.1">header</a> to <em>application/json</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>Internationalization</h2>
    <p>
    <small>(Please note that this is an experimental feature and does not work for all cities!)</small>
    </p>
    <p>
    Most of the featured methods honor the <code>Accept-Language</code>
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.4">header</a>. This header is used for
    localizing cities and countries. The default language is English (en), but you can provide any of the languages
    Spanish (es), French (fr), German (de), Portuguese (pt), Turkish (tr), Italian (it) or Polish (pl).
    </p>
    <p>
    E.g. if you search a setlist for a concert that took place in Vienna and you pass &quot;de&quot; as header, you'll
    get <em>&quot;Wien, &Ouml;sterreich&quot;</em> instead of <em>&quot;Vienna, Austria&quot;</em>.<br/>
    This also works if you use a different language than the country's native language.
    </p>
    <p>
    E.g. for a concert in New York, you'll get <em>&quot;Nueva York, Estados Unidos&quot;</em> instead of <em>&quot;New
    York, United States&quot;</em> if you pass &quot;es&quot; as language.
    </p>

    <h2>API Keys</h2>

    API keys (<a href="https://www.setlist.fm/settings/api">application form</a>) must be included in the request with
    the <code>x-api-key</code> header.

      Setlists, that's what it's all about. So if you're trying to use this API without knowing what a setlist is then
      you're kinda wrong on this page ;-).

      A setlist can be distinguished from other setlists by its unique id. But as
      <a href="https://www.setlist.fm/">setlist.fm</a> works the wiki way, there can be different versions of one setlist
      (each time a user updates a setlist a new version gets created). These different versions have a unique id on its
      own. So setlists can have the same id although they differ as far as the content is concerned - thus the best way to
      check if two setlists are the same is to compare their versionIds.

      Setlists, that's what it's all about. So if you're trying to use this API without knowing what a setlist is then
      you're kinda wrong on this page ;-).

      A setlist can be distinguished from other setlists by its unique id. But as
      <a href="https://www.setlist.fm/">setlist.fm</a> works the wiki way, there can be different versions of one setlist
      (each time a user updates a setlist a new version gets created). These different versions have a unique id on its
      own. So setlists can have the same id although they differ as far as the content is concerned - thus the best way to
      check if two setlists are the same is to compare their versionIds.

      Venues are places where concerts take place. They usually consist of a venue name and a city - but there are also
      some venues that do not have a city attached yet. In such a case, the city simply isn't set and the city and country
      may (but do not have to) be in the name.
