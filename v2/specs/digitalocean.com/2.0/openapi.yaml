    # Introduction

    The DigitalOcean API allows you to manage Droplets and resources within the
    DigitalOcean cloud in a simple, programmatic way using conventional HTTP requests.

    All of the functionality that you are familiar with in the DigitalOcean
    control panel is also available through the API, allowing you to script the
    complex actions that your situation requires.

    The API documentation will start with a general overview about the design
    and technology that has been implemented, followed by reference information
    about specific endpoints.

    ## Requests

    Any tool that is fluent in HTTP can communicate with the API simply by
    requesting the correct URI. Requests should be made using the HTTPS protocol
    so that traffic is encrypted. The interface responds to different methods
    depending on the action required.

    |Method|Usage|
    |--- |--- |
    |GET|For simple retrieval of information about your account, Droplets, or environment, you should use the GET method.  The information you request will be returned to you as a JSON object. The attributes defined by the JSON object can be used to form additional requests.  Any request using the GET method is read-only and will not affect any of the objects you are querying.|
    |DELETE|To destroy a resource and remove it from your account and environment, the DELETE method should be used.  This will remove the specified object if it is found.  If it is not found, the operation will return a response indicating that the object was not found. This idempotency means that you do not have to check for a resource's availability prior to issuing a delete command, the final state will be the same regardless of its existence.|
    |PUT|To update the information about a resource in your account, the PUT method is available. Like the DELETE Method, the PUT method is idempotent.  It sets the state of the target using the provided values, regardless of their current values. Requests using the PUT method do not need to check the current attributes of the object.|
    |PATCH|Some resources support partial modification. In these cases, the PATCH method is available. Unlike PUT which generally requires a complete representation of a resource, a PATCH request is is a set of instructions on how to modify a resource updating only specific attributes.|
    |POST|To create a new object, your request should specify the POST method. The POST request includes all of the attributes necessary to create a new object.  When you wish to create a new object, send a POST request to the target endpoint.|
    |HEAD|Finally, to retrieve metadata information, you should use the HEAD method to get the headers.  This returns only the header of what would be returned with an associated GET request. Response headers contain some useful information about your API access and the results that are available for your request. For instance, the headers contain your current rate-limit value and the amount of time available until the limit resets. It also contains metrics about the total number of objects found, pagination information, and the total content length.|


    ## HTTP Statuses

    Along with the HTTP methods that the API responds to, it will also return
    standard HTTP statuses, including error codes.

    In the event of a problem, the status will contain the error code, while the
    body of the response will usually contain additional information about the
    problem that was encountered.

    In general, if the status returned is in the 200 range, it indicates that
    the request was fulfilled successfully and that no error was encountered.

    Return codes in the 400 range typically indicate that there was an issue
    with the request that was sent. Among other things, this could mean that you
    did not authenticate correctly, that you are requesting an action that you
    do not have authorization for, that the object you are requesting does not
    exist, or that your request is malformed.

    If you receive a status in the 500 range, this generally indicates a
    server-side problem. This means that we are having an issue on our end and
    cannot fulfill your request currently.

    400 and 500 level error responses will include a JSON object in their body,
    including the following attributes:

    |Name|Type|Description|
    |--- |--- |--- |
    |id|string|A short identifier corresponding to the HTTP status code returned. For example, the ID for a response returning a 404 status code would be "not_found."|
    |message|string|A message providing additional information about the error, including details to help resolve it when possible.|
    |request_id|string|Optionally, some endpoints may include a request ID that should be provided when reporting bugs or opening support tickets to help identify the issue.|

    ### Example Error Response

    ```
        HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
        {
          "id":       "forbidden",
          "message":  "You do not have access for the attempted action."
        }
    ```

    ## Responses

    When a request is successful, a response body will typically be sent back in
    the form of a JSON object. An exception to this is when a DELETE request is
    processed, which will result in a successful HTTP 204 status and an empty
    response body.

    Inside of this JSON object, the resource root that was the target of the
    request will be set as the key. This will be the singular form of the word
    if the request operated on a single object, and the plural form of the word
    if a collection was processed.

    For example, if you send a GET request to `/v2/droplets/$DROPLET_ID` you
    will get back an object with a key called "`droplet`". However, if you send
    the GET request to the general collection at `/v2/droplets`, you will get
    back an object with a key called "`droplets`".

    The value of these keys will generally be a JSON object for a request on a
    single object and an array of objects for a request on a collection of
    objects.

    ### Response for a Single Object

    ```
        {
            "droplet": {
                "name": "example.com"
                . . .
            }
        }
    ```

    ### Response for an Object Collection

    ```
        {
            "droplets": [
                {
                    "name": "example.com"
                    . . .
                },
                {
                    "name": "second.com"
                    . . .
                }
            ]
        }
    ```

    ## Meta

    In addition to the main resource root, the response may also contain a
    `meta` object. This object contains information about the response itself.

    The `meta` object contains a `total` key that is set to the total number of
    objects returned by the request. This has implications on the `links` object
    and pagination.

    The `meta` object will only be displayed when it has a value. Currently, the
    `meta` object will have a value when a request is made on a collection (like
    `droplets` or `domains`).


    ### Sample Meta Object

    ```
        {
            . . .
            "meta": {
                "total": 43
            }
            . . .
        }
    ```

    ## Links & Pagination

    The `links` object is returned as part of the response body when pagination
    is enabled. By default, 20 objects are returned per page. If the response
    contains 20 objects or fewer, no `links` object will be returned. If the
    response contains more than 20 objects, the first 20 will be returned along
    with the `links` object.

    You can request a different pagination limit or force pagination by
    appending `?per_page=` to the request with the number of items you would
    like per page. For instance, to show only two results per page, you could
    add `?per_page=2` to the end of your query. The maximum number of results
    per page is 200.

    The `links` object contains a `pages` object. The `pages` object, in turn,
    contains keys indicating the relationship of additional pages. The values of
    these are the URLs of the associated pages. The keys will be one of the
    following:

    *   **first**: The URI of the first page of results.
    *   **prev**: The URI of the previous sequential page of results.
    *   **next**: The URI of the next sequential page of results.
    *   **last**: The URI of the last page of results.

    The `pages` object will only include the links that make sense. So for the
    first page of results, no `first` or `prev` links will ever be set. This
    convention holds true in other situations where a link would not make sense.

    ### Sample Links Object

    ```
        {
            . . .
            "links": {
                "pages": {
                    "last": "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/images?page=2",
                    "next": "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/images?page=2"
                }
            }
            . . .
        }
    ```

    ## Rate Limit

    Requests through the API are rate limited per OAuth token. Current rate limits:

    *   5,000 requests per hour
    *   250 requests per minute (5% of the hourly total)

    Once you exceed either limit, you will be rate limited until the next cycle
    starts. Space out any requests that you would otherwise issue in bursts for
    the best results.

    The rate limiting information is contained within the response headers of
    each request. The relevant headers are:

    *   **ratelimit-limit**: The number of requests that can be made per hour.
    *   **ratelimit-remaining**: The number of requests that remain before you hit your request limit. See the information below for how the request limits expire.
    *   **ratelimit-reset**: This represents the time when the oldest request will expire. The value is given in [Unix epoch time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). See below for more information about how request limits expire.

    As long as the `ratelimit-remaining` count is above zero, you will be able
    to make additional requests.

    The way that a request expires and is removed from the current limit count
    is important to understand. Rather than counting all of the requests for an
    hour and resetting the `ratelimit-remaining` value at the end of the hour,
    each request instead has its own timer.

    This means that each request contributes toward the `ratelimit-remaining`
    count for one complete hour after the request is made. When that request's
    timer runs out, it is no longer counted towards the request limit.

    This has implications on the meaning of the `ratelimit-reset` header as
    well. Because the entire rate limit is not reset at one time, the value of
    this header is set to the time when the _oldest_ request will expire.

    Keep this in mind if you see your `ratelimit-reset` value change, but not
    move an entire hour into the future.

    If the `ratelimit-remaining` reaches zero, subsequent requests will receive
    a 429 error code until the request reset has been reached. You can see the
    format of the response in the examples.

    **Note:** The following endpoints have special rate limit requirements that
    are independent of the limits defined above.

    *   Only 12 `POST` requests to the `/v2/floating_ips` endpoint to create Floating IPs can be made per 60 seconds.
    *   Only 10 `GET` requests to the `/v2/account/keys` endpoint to list SSH keys can be made per 60 seconds.
    *   Only 5 requests to any and all `v2/cdn/endpoints` can be made per 10 seconds. This includes `v2/cdn/endpoints`, 
        `v2/cdn/endpoints/$ENDPOINT_ID`, and `v2/cdn/endpoints/$ENDPOINT_ID/cache`.
    *   Only 50 strings within the `files` json struct in the `v2/cdn/endpoints/$ENDPOINT_ID/cache` [payload](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/api-reference/#operation/cdn_purge_cache) 
        can be requested every 20 seconds.

    ### Sample Rate Limit Headers

    ```
        . . .
        ratelimit-limit: 1200
        ratelimit-remaining: 1193
        rateLimit-reset: 1402425459
        . . .
    ```

    ### Sample Rate Exceeded Response

    ```
        429 Too Many Requests
        {
                id: "too_many_requests",
                message: "API Rate limit exceeded."
        }
    ```

    ## Curl Examples

    Throughout this document, some example API requests will be given using the
    `curl` command. This will allow us to demonstrate the various endpoints in a
    simple, textual format.
      
      These examples assume that you are using a Linux or macOS command line. To run
    these commands on a Windows machine, you can either use cmd.exe, PowerShell, or WSL:

    * For cmd.exe, use the `set VAR=VALUE` [syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/set_1)
    to define environment variables, call them with `%VAR%`, then replace all backslashes (`\`) in the examples with carets (`^`).

    * For PowerShell, use the `$Env:VAR = "VALUE"` [syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables?view=powershell-7.2)
    to define environment variables, call them with `$Env:VAR`, then replace `curl` with `curl.exe` and all backslashes (`\`) in the examples with backticks (`` ` ``).

    * WSL is a compatibility layer that allows you to emulate a Linux terminal on a Windows machine.
    Install WSL with our [community tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-2-on-microsoft-windows-10), 
    then follow this API documentation normally.

    The names of account-specific references (like Droplet IDs, for instance)
    will be represented by variables. For instance, a Droplet ID may be
    represented by a variable called `$DROPLET_ID`. You can set the associated
    variables in your environment if you wish to use the examples without
    modification.

    The first variable that you should set to get started is your OAuth
    authorization token. The next section will go over the details of this, but
    you can set an environmental variable for it now.

    Generate a token by going to the [Apps & API](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/applications)
    section of the DigitalOcean control panel. Use an existing token if you have
    saved one, or generate a new token with the "Generate new token" button.
    Copy the generated token and use it to set and export the TOKEN variable in
    your environment as the example shows.

    You may also wish to set some other variables now or as you go along. For
    example, you may wish to set the `DROPLET_ID` variable to one of your
    Droplet IDs since this will be used frequently in the API.

    If you are following along, make sure you use a Droplet ID that you control
    so that your commands will execute correctly.

    If you need access to the headers of a response through `curl`, you can pass
    the `-i` flag to display the header information along with the body. If you
    are only interested in the header, you can instead pass the `-I` flag, which
    will exclude the response body entirely.


    ### Set and Export your OAuth Token

    ```
    export DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN=your_token_here
    ```

    ### Set and Export a Variable

    ```
    export DROPLET_ID=1111111
    ```

    ## Parameters

    There are two different ways to pass parameters in a request with the API.

    When passing parameters to create or update an object, parameters should be
    passed as a JSON object containing the appropriate attribute names and
    values as key-value pairs. When you use this format, you should specify that
    you are sending a JSON object in the header. This is done by setting the
    `Content-Type` header to `application/json`. This ensures that your request
    is interpreted correctly.

    When passing parameters to filter a response on GET requests, parameters can
    be passed using standard query attributes. In this case, the parameters
    would be embedded into the URI itself by appending a `?` to the end of the
    URI and then setting each attribute with an equal sign. Attributes can be
    separated with a `&`. Tools like `curl` can create the appropriate URI when
    given parameters and values; this can also be done using the `-F` flag and
    then passing the key and value as an argument. The argument should take the
    form of a quoted string with the attribute being set to a value with an
    equal sign.

    ### Pass Parameters as a JSON Object

    ```
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{"name": "example.com", "ip_address": "127.0.0.1"}' \
            -X POST "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/domains"
    ```

    ### Pass Filter Parameters as a Query String

    ```
         curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN" \
             -X GET \
             "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/images?private=true"
    ```

    ## Cross Origin Resource Sharing

    In order to make requests to the API from other domains, the API implements
    Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support.

    CORS support is generally used to create AJAX requests outside of the domain
    that the request originated from. This is necessary to implement projects
    like control panels utilizing the API. This tells the browser that it can
    send requests to an outside domain.

    The procedure that the browser initiates in order to perform these actions
    (other than GET requests) begins by sending a "preflight" request. This sets
    the `Origin` header and uses the `OPTIONS` method. The server will reply
    back with the methods it allows and some of the limits it imposes. The
    client then sends the actual request if it falls within the allowed
    constraints.

    This process is usually done in the background by the browser, but you can
    use curl to emulate this process using the example provided. The headers
    that will be set to show the constraints are:

    *   **Access-Control-Allow-Origin**: This is the domain that is sent by the client or browser as the origin of the request. It is set through an `Origin` header.
    *   **Access-Control-Allow-Methods**: This specifies the allowed options for requests from that domain. This will generally be all available methods.
    *   **Access-Control-Expose-Headers**: This will contain the headers that will be available to requests from the origin domain.
    *   **Access-Control-Max-Age**: This is the length of time that the access is considered valid. After this expires, a new preflight should be sent.
    *   **Access-Control-Allow-Credentials**: This will be set to `true`. It basically allows you to send your OAuth token for authentication.

    You should not need to be concerned with the details of these headers,
    because the browser will typically do all of the work for you.

      The billing endpoints allow you to retrieve your account balance, invoices
      and billing history.

      **Balance:** By sending requests to the `/v2/customers/my/balance` endpoint, you can
      retrieve the balance information for the requested customer account.

      **Invoices:** [Invoices](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/accounts/billing/invoices/)
      are generated on the first of each month for every DigitalOcean
      customer. An invoice preview is generated daily, which can be accessed
      with the `preview` keyword in place of `$INVOICE_UUID`. To interact with
      invoices, you will generally send requests to the invoices endpoint at
      `/v2/customers/my/invoices`.

      **Billing History:** Billing history is a record of billing events for your account.
      For example, entries may include events like payments made, invoices
      issued, or credits granted. To interact with invoices, you

      and manage other configuration details.

      Database clusters may be deployed in a multi-node, high-availability configuration.
      If your machine type is above the basic nodes, your node plan is above the smallest option,
      or you are running MongoDB, you may additionally include up to two standby nodes in your cluster.

      The size of individual nodes in a database cluster is represented by a human-readable slug,
      which is used in some of the following requests. Each slug denotes the node's identifier,
      CPU count, and amount of RAM, in that order.

      For **Basic nodes**, reference the following table for its slug:

      Slug               | CPU     | RAM

      Domain record resources are used to set or retrieve information about the
      individual DNS records configured for a domain. This allows you to build
      and manage DNS zone files by adding and modifying individual records for a
      domain.

      Droplet actions are tasks that can be executed on a Droplet. These can be
      things like rebooting, resizing, snapshotting, etc.

      Droplet action requests are generally targeted at one of the "actions"
      endpoints for a specific Droplet. The specific actions are usually
      initiated by sending a POST request with the action and arguments as
      parameters.

      Droplet action requests create a Droplet actions object, which can be used
      to get information about the status of an action. Creating a Droplet
      action is asynchronous: the HTTP call will return the action object before
      the action has finished processing on the Droplet. The current status of
      an action can be retrieved from either the Droplet actions endpoint or the
      global actions endpoint. If a Droplet action is uncompleted it may block
      the creation of a subsequent action for that Droplet, the locked attribute
      of the Droplet will be true and attempts to create a Droplet action will
      fail with a status of 422.

      The Reserved IP product's endpoints function the exact same way as Floating IPs.
      The only difference is the name change throughout the URLs and fields.
      For example, the `floating_ips` field is now the `reserved_ips` field.
      The Floating IP endpoints will remain active until fall 2023 before being
      permanently deprecated.

      With the exception of the [Projects API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/api-reference/#tag/Projects),
      we will reflect this change as an additional field in the responses across the API
      where the `floating_ip` field is used. For example, the Droplet metadata response

      A DigitalOcean [image](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/) can be
      used to create a Droplet and may come in a number of flavors. Currently,

      distributions, and custom images.

      * [Snapshots](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/snapshots/) provide
      a full copy of an existing Droplet instance taken on demand.

      * [Backups](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/backups/) are similar
      to snapshots but are created automatically at regular intervals when
      enabled for a Droplet.

      * [Custom images](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/custom-images/)
      are Linux-based virtual machine images (raw, qcow2, vhdx, vdi, and vmdk
      formats are supported) that you may upload for use on DigitalOcean.

      * Distributions are the public Linux distributions that are available to
      be used as a base to create Droplets.

      * Applications, or [1-Click Apps](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/one-clicks/),
      are distributions pre-configured with additional software.

      DigitalOcean.

      ### Supported Resource Types Examples

      Projects resources are identified by uniform resource names or URNs. A
      valid URN has the following format: `do:resource_type:resource_id`. The
      following resource types are supported:

      Resource Type      | Example URN
      -------------------|------------
      App Platform App   | `do:app:be5aab85-851b-4cab-b2ed-98d5a63ba4e8`

      Domain             | `do:domain:example.com`
      Droplet            | `do:droplet:4126873`
      Floating IP        | `do:floatingip:192.168.99.100`
      Kubernetes Cluster | `do:kubernetes:bd5f5959-5e1e-4205-a714-a914373942af`
      Load Balancer      | `do:loadbalancer:39052d89-8dd4-4d49-8d5a-3c3b6b365b5b`
      Space              | `do:space:my-website-assets`
      Volume             | `do:volume:6fc4c277-ea5c-448a-93cd-dd496cfef71f`

      ### Resource Status Codes

      When assigning and retrieving resources in projects, a `status` attribute
      is returned that indicates if a resource was successfully retrieved or
      assigned. The status codes can be one of the following:

      Status Code        | Explanation
      -------------------|------------
      `ok`               | There was no problem retrieving or assigning a resource.
      `not_found`        | The resource was not found.
      `assigned`         | The resource was successfully assigned.
      `already_assigned` | The resource was already assigned.
      `service_down`     | There was a problem retrieving or assigning a resource. Please try again.

      selected so that the correct resources can be allocated.

      Each size represents a plan that bundles together specific sets of
      resources. This includes the amount of RAM, the number of virtual CPUs,

      filesystems, each defines a `min_disk_size` attribute which is the minimum
      size of the Droplet or volume disk when creating a new resource from the
      saved snapshot.

            When using Let's Encrypt, the initial value of the certificate's `state` attribute will be `pending`. When the certificate has been successfully issued by Let's Encrypt, this will transition to `verified` and be ready for use.

        To create a database cluster, send a POST request to `/v2/databases`.
        The response will be a JSON object with a key called `database`. The value of this will be an object that contains the standard attributes associated with a database cluster. The initial value of the database cluster's `status` attribute will be `creating`. When the cluster is ready to receive traffic, this will transition to `online`.
        The embedded `connection` and `private_connection` objects will contain the information needed to access the database cluster.
        DigitalOcean managed PostgreSQL and MySQL database clusters take automated daily backups. To create a new database cluster based on a backup of an existing cluster, send a POST request to `/v2/databases`. In addition to the standard database cluster attributes, the JSON body must include a key named `backup_restore` with the name of the original database cluster and the timestamp of the backup to be restored. Creating a database from a backup is the same as forking a database in the control panel.
        Note: Backups are not supported for Redis clusters.

        To update a database cluster's firewall rules (known as "trusted sources" in the control panel), send a PUT request to `/v2/databases/$DATABASE_ID/firewall` specifying which resources should be able to open connections to the database. You may limit connections to specific Droplets, Kubernetes clusters, or IP addresses. When a tag is provided, any Droplet or Kubernetes node with that tag applied to it will have access. The firewall is limited to 100 rules (or trusted sources). When possible, we recommend [placing your databases into a VPC network](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/vpc/) to limit access to them instead of using a firewall.

        To migrate a database cluster to a new region, send a `PUT` request to
        `/v2/databases/$DATABASE_ID/migrate`. The body of the request must specify a
        `region` attribute.

        A successful request will receive a 202 Accepted status code with no body in
        response. Querying the database cluster will show that its `status` attribute
        will now be set to `migrating`. This will transition back to `online` when the
        migration has completed.

        For PostgreSQL database clusters, connection pools can be used to allow a
        database to share its idle connections. The popular PostgreSQL connection
        pooling utility PgBouncer is used to provide this service. [See here for more information](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases/postgresql/how-to/manage-connection-pools/)
        about how and why to use PgBouncer connection pooling including
        details about the available transaction modes.

        To add a new connection pool to a PostgreSQL database cluster, send a POST
        request to `/v2/databases/$DATABASE_ID/pools` specifying a name for the pool,
        the user to connect with, the database to connect to, as well as its desired
        size and transaction mode.

        To create a read-only replica for a PostgreSQL or MySQL database cluster, send a POST request to `/v2/databases/$DATABASE_ID/replicas` specifying the name it should be given, the size of the node to be used, and the region where it will be located.

        **Note**: Read-only replicas are not supported for Redis clusters.

        The response will be a JSON object with a key called `replica`. The value of this will be an object that contains the standard attributes associated with a database replica. The initial value of the read-only replica's `status` attribute will be `forking`. When the replica is ready to receive traffic, this will transition to `active`.

        To add a new database user, send a POST request to `/v2/databases/$DATABASE_ID/users`
        with the desired username.

        Note: User management is not supported for Redis clusters.

        When adding a user to a MySQL cluster, additional options can be configured in the
        `mysql_settings` object.

        The response will be a JSON object with a key called `user`. The value of this will be an
        object that contains the standard attributes associated with a database user including
        its randomly generated password.

        To list all Droplets in your account, send a GET request to `/v2/droplets`.

        The response body will be a JSON object with a key of `droplets`. This will be
        set to an array containing objects each representing a Droplet. These will
        contain the standard Droplet attributes.

        ### Filtering Results by Tag

        It's possible to request filtered results by including certain query parameters.
        To only list Droplets assigned to a specific tag, include the `tag_name` query
        parameter set to the name of the tag in your GET request. For example,
        `/v2/droplets?tag_name=$TAG_NAME`.

        To create a new Droplet, send a POST request to `/v2/droplets` setting the
        required attributes.

        A Droplet will be created using the provided information. The response body
        will contain a JSON object with a key called `droplet`. The value will be an
        object containing the standard attributes for your new Droplet. The response
        code, 202 Accepted, does not indicate the success or failure of the operation,
        just that the request has been accepted for processing. The `actions` returned
        as part of the response's `links` object can be used to check the status
        of the Droplet create event.

        ### Create Multiple Droplets

        Creating multiple Droplets is very similar to creating a single Droplet.
        Instead of sending `name` as a string, send `names` as an array of strings. A
        Droplet will be created for each name you send using the associated
        information. Up to ten Droplets may be created this way at a time.

        Rather than returning a single Droplet, the response body will contain a JSON
        array with a key called `droplets`. This will be set to an array of JSON
        objects, each of which will contain the standard Droplet attributes. The
        response code, 202 Accepted, does not indicate the success or failure of any
        operation, just that the request has been accepted for processing. The array
        of `actions` returned as part of the response's `links` object can be used to

        To initiate an action on a Droplet send a POST request to
        `/v2/droplets/$DROPLET_ID/actions`. In the JSON body to the request,
        set the `type` attribute to on of the supported action types:

        | Action                                   | Details |
        | ---------------------------------------- | ----------- |
        | <nobr>`enable_backups`</nobr>            | Enables backups for a Droplet |
        | <nobr>`disable_backups`</nobr>           | Disables backups for a Droplet |
        | <nobr>`reboot`</nobr>                    | Reboots a Droplet. A `reboot` action is an attempt to reboot the Droplet in a graceful way, similar to using the `reboot` command from the console. |
        | <nobr>`power_cycle`</nobr>               | Power cycles a Droplet. A `powercycle` action is similar to pushing the reset button on a physical machine, it's similar to booting from scratch. |
        | <nobr>`shutdown`</nobr>                  | Shutsdown a Droplet. A shutdown action is an attempt to shutdown the Droplet in a graceful way, similar to using the `shutdown` command from the console. Since a `shutdown` command can fail, this action guarantees that the command is issued, not that it succeeds. The preferred way to turn off a Droplet is to attempt a shutdown, with a reasonable timeout, followed by a `power_off` action to ensure the Droplet is off. |
        | <nobr>`power_off`</nobr>                 | Powers off a Droplet. A `power_off` event is a hard shutdown and should only be used if the `shutdown` action is not successful. It is similar to cutting the power on a server and could lead to complications. |
        | <nobr>`power_on`</nobr>                  | Powers on a Droplet. |
        | <nobr>`restore`</nobr>                   | Restore a Droplet using a backup image. The image ID that is passed in must be a backup of the current Droplet instance. The operation will leave any embedded SSH keys intact. |
        | <nobr>`password_reset`</nobr>            | Resets the root password for a Droplet. A new password will be provided via email. It must be changed after first use. |

        endpoint. The headers of this request must include an `X-Dangerous` key set to

        Droplet's associated resources. This operation _can not_ be reverse and should
        be used with caution.

        A successful response will include a 202 response code and no content. Use the

        ## Filtering Results
        -----

        It's possible to request filtered results by including certain query parameters.

        **Image Type**

        Either 1-Click Application or OS Distribution images can be filtered by using the `type` query parameter.

        > Important: The `type` query parameter does not directly relate to the `type` attribute.

        To retrieve only ***distribution*** images, include the `type` query parameter set to distribution, `/v2/images?type=distribution`.

        To retrieve only ***application*** images, include the `type` query parameter set to application, `/v2/images?type=application`.

        **User Images**

        To retrieve only the private images of a user, include the `private` query parameter set to true, `/v2/images?private=true`.

        **Tags**

        To list all images assigned to a specific tag, include the `tag_name` query parameter set to the name of the tag in your GET request. For example, `/v2/images?tag_name=$TAG_NAME`.
      operationId: images_list
      parameters:
        - description: Filters results based on image type which can be either `application` or `distribution`.

        when disruptive maintenance tasks may be carried out. Omitting the policy
        implies that a window will be chosen automatically. See
        [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/kubernetes/how-to/upgrade-cluster/)
        for details.

              Kubernetes Cluster with Multiple Node Pools Request:
                description: |
                  This example request creates a Kubernetes cluster with two node pools. It
                  also demonstrates setting tags, labels, auto scaling, and a maintenance
                  policy.

            The response will be a JSON object with a key called `kubernetes_cluster`. The
            value of this will be an object containing the standard attributes of a
            Kubernetes cluster.

            The IP address and cluster API server endpoint will not be available until the
            cluster has finished provisioning. The initial value of the cluster's
            `status.state` attribute will be `provisioning`. When the cluster is ready,
            this will transition to `running`.

        Clusterlint helps operators conform to Kubernetes best practices around
        resources, security and reliability to avoid common problems while operating
        or upgrading the clusters.

        To request a clusterlint run on your cluster, send a POST request to
        `/v2/kubernetes/clusters/$K8S_CLUSTER_ID/clusterlint`. This will run all
        checks present in the `doks` group by default, if a request body is not
        specified. Optionally specify the below attributes.

        For information about the available checks, please refer to
        [the clusterlint check documentation](https://github.com/digitalocean/clusterlint/blob/master/checks.md).

        This endpoint returns a JSON object . It can be used to programmatically
        construct Kubernetes clients which cannot parse kubeconfig files.

        The resulting JSON object contains token-based authentication for clusters
        supporting it, and certificate-based authentication otherwise. For a list of
        supported versions and more information, see "[How to Connect to a DigitalOcean
        Kubernetes Cluster with kubectl](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/kubernetes/how-to/connect-with-kubectl/)".

        To retrieve credentials for accessing a Kubernetes cluster, send a GET
        request to `/v2/kubernetes/clusters/$K8S_CLUSTER_ID/credentials`.

        Clusters supporting token-based authentication may define an expiration by
        passing a duration in seconds as a query parameter to
        `/v2/kubernetes/clusters/$K8S_CLUSTER_ID/kubeconfig?expiry_seconds=$DURATION_IN_SECONDS`.
        If not set or 0, then the token will have a 7 day expiry. The query parameter
        has no impact in certificate-based authentication.

        connect to and administer the cluster using the Kubernetes command line tool,
        `kubectl`, or other programs supporting kubeconfig files (e.g., client libraries).

        The resulting kubeconfig file uses token-based authentication for clusters
        supporting it, and certificate-based authentication otherwise. For a list of
        supported versions and more information, see "[How to Connect to a DigitalOcean
        Kubernetes Cluster with kubectl](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/kubernetes/how-to/connect-with-kubectl/)".

        To retrieve a kubeconfig file for use with a Kubernetes cluster, send a GET
        request to `/v2/kubernetes/clusters/$K8S_CLUSTER_ID/kubeconfig`.

        Clusters supporting token-based authentication may define an expiration by
        passing a duration in seconds as a query parameter to
        `/v2/kubernetes/clusters/$K8S_CLUSTER_ID/kubeconfig?expiry_seconds=$DURATION_IN_SECONDS`.
        If not set or 0, then the token will have a 7 day expiry. The query parameter

        To create a new load balancer instance, send a POST request to
        `/v2/load_balancers`.

        You can specify the Droplets that will sit behind the load balancer using one
        of two methods:

        * Set `droplet_ids` to a list of specific Droplet IDs.
        * Set `tag` to the name of a tag. All Droplets with this tag applied will be
          assigned to the load balancer. Additional Droplets will be automatically
          assigned as they are tagged.

        These methods are mutually exclusive.

        `/v2/load_balancers/$LOAD_BALANCER_ID/droplets`. In the body of the request,
        there should be a `droplet_ids` attribute containing a list of Droplet IDs.

        No response body will be sent back, but the response code will indicate
        success. Specifically, the response code will be a 204, which means that the

        To assign a Droplet to a load balancer instance, send a POST request to
        `/v2/load_balancers/$LOAD_BALANCER_ID/droplets`. In the body of the request,
        there should be a `droplet_ids` attribute containing a list of Droplet IDs.
        Individual Droplets can not be added to a load balancer configured with a
        Droplet tag. Attempting to do so will result in a "422 Unprocessable Entity"
        response from the API.

        No response body will be sent back, but the response code will indicate
        success. Specifically, the response code will be a 204, which means that the
        action was successful with no returned body data.

          The `type` field dictates what type of entity that the alert policy applies to and hence what type of entity is passed in the `entities` array. If both the `tags` array and `entities` array are empty the alert policy applies to all entities of the relevant type that are owned by the user account. Otherwise the following table shows the valid entity types for each type of alert policy:

          The `type` field dictates what type of entity that the alert policy applies to and hence what type of entity is passed in the `entities` array. If both the `tags` array and `entities` array are empty the alert policy applies to all entities of the relevant type that are owned by the user account. Otherwise the following table shows the valid entity types for each type of alert policy:

      description: |
        In order to access your container registry with the Docker client or from a
        Kubernetes cluster, you will need to configure authentication. The necessary
        JSON configuration can be retrieved by sending a GET request to
        `/v2/registry/docker-credentials`.

        The response will be in the format of a Docker `config.json` file. To use the
        config in your Kubernetes cluster, create a Secret with:

            kubectl create secret generic docr \
              --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=config.json \
              --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson

        By default, the returned credentials have read-only access to your registry
        and cannot be used to push images. This is appropriate for most Kubernetes
        clusters. To retrieve read/write credentials, suitable for use with the Docker
        client or in a CI system, read_write may be provided as query parameter. For
        example: `/v2/registry/docker-credentials?read_write=true`

        By default, the returned credentials will not expire. To retrieve credentials
        with an expiry set, expiry_seconds may be provided as a query parameter. For
        example: `/v2/registry/docker-credentials?expiry_seconds=3600` will return
        credentials that expire after one hour.

        Garbage collection enables users to clear out unreferenced blobs (layer &
        manifest data) after deleting one or more manifests from a repository. If
        there are no unreferenced blobs resulting from the deletion of one or more
        manifests, garbage collection is effectively a noop.
        [See here for more information](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/container-registry/how-to/clean-up-container-registry/)
        about how and why you should clean up your container registry periodically.

        To request a garbage collection run on your registry, send a POST request to
        `/v2/registry/$REGISTRY_NAME/garbage-collection`. This will initiate the
        following sequence of events on your registry.

        * Set the registry to read-only mode, meaning no further write-scoped
          JWTs will be issued to registry clients. Existing write-scoped JWTs will
          continue to work until they expire which can take up to 15 minutes.
        * Wait until all existing write-scoped JWTs have expired.
        * Scan all registry manifests to determine which blobs are unreferenced.
        * Delete all unreferenced blobs from the registry.
        * Record the number of blobs deleted and bytes freed, mark the garbage
          collection status as `success`.
        * Remove the read-only mode restriction from the registry, meaning write-scoped
          JWTs will once again be issued to registry clients.

        ### Filtering Results by Resource Type

        It's possible to request filtered results by including certain query parameters.

        #### List Droplet Snapshots

        To retrieve only snapshots based on Droplets, include the `resource_type`
        query parameter set to `droplet`. For example, `/v2/snapshots?resource_type=droplet`.

        #### List Volume Snapshots

        To retrieve only snapshots based on volumes, include the `resource_type`
        query parameter set to `volume`. For example, `/v2/snapshots?resource_type=volume`.

                            A tag is a label that can be applied to a resource (currently Droplets, Images, Volumes, Volume Snapshots, and Database clusters) in order to better organize or facilitate the lookups and actions on it.
                            Tags have two attributes: a user defined `name` attribute and an embedded `resources` attribute with information about resources that have been tagged.
                          properties:
                            name:
                              description: |
                                The name of the tag. Tags may contain letters, numbers, colons, dashes, and underscores.
                                There is a limit of 255 characters per tag.

                                **Note:** Tag names are case stable, which means the capitalization you use when you first create a tag is canonical.

                                When working with tags in the API, you must use the tag's canonical capitalization. For example, if you create a tag named "PROD", the URL to add that tag to a resource would be `https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/tags/PROD/resources` (not `/v2/tags/prod/resources`).

                                Tagged resources in the control panel will always display the canonical capitalization. For example, if you create a tag named "PROD", you can tag resources in the control panel by entering "prod". The tag will still display with its canonical capitalization, "PROD".

        To list all of the block storage volumes available on your account, send a GET request to `/v2/volumes`.
        ## Filtering Results
        ### By Region
        The `region` may be provided as query parameter in order to restrict results to volumes available in a specific region. For example: `/v2/volumes?region=nyc1`
        ### By Name
        It is also possible to list volumes on your account that match a specified name. To do so, send a GET request with the volume's name as a query parameter to `/v2/volumes?name=$VOLUME_NAME`.
        **Note:** You can only create one volume per region with the same name.
        ### By Name and Region
        It is also possible to retrieve information about a block storage volume by name. To do so, send a GET request with the volume's name and the region slug for the region it is located in as query parameters to `/v2/volumes?name=$VOLUME_NAME&region=nyc1`.

        Each volume may only be attached to a single Droplet. However, up to five
        volumes may be attached to a Droplet at a time. Pre-formatted volumes will be
        automatically mounted to Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Fedora Atomic, and CentOS
        Droplets created on or after April 26, 2018 when attached. On older Droplets,
        [additional configuration](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-partition-and-format-digitalocean-block-storage-volumes-in-linux#mounting-the-filesystems)
        is required.

        Each volume may only be attached to a single Droplet. However, up to seven
        volumes may be attached to a Droplet at a time. Pre-formatted volumes will be
        automatically mounted to Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Fedora Atomic, and CentOS
        Droplets created on or after April 26, 2018 when attached. On older Droplets,
        [additional configuration](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-partition-and-format-digitalocean-block-storage-volumes-in-linux#mounting-the-filesystems)
        is required.

        ## OAuth Authentication

        In order to interact with the DigitalOcean API, you or your application must
        authenticate.

        The DigitalOcean API handles this through OAuth, an open standard for
        authorization. OAuth allows you to delegate access to your account in full
        or in read-only mode.

        You can generate an OAuth token by visiting the [Apps & API](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens)
        section of the DigitalOcean control panel for your account.

        An OAuth token functions as a complete authentication request. In effect, it
        acts as a substitute for a username and password pair.

        Because of this, it is absolutely **essential** that you keep your OAuth
        tokens secure. In fact, upon generation, the web interface will only display
        each token a single time in order to prevent the token from being compromised.

        DigitalOcean access tokens begin with an identifiable prefix in order to
        distinguish them from other similar tokens.

        - `dop_v1_` for personal access tokens generated in the control panel
        - `doo_v1_` for tokens generated by applications using [the OAuth flow](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/oauth-api/)
        - `dor_v1_` for OAuth refresh tokens

        ### How to Authenticate with OAuth

        In order to make an authenticated request, include a bearer-type
        `Authorization` header containing your OAuth token. All requests must be
        made over HTTPS.

        ### Authenticate with a Bearer Authorization Header

        ```
        curl -X $HTTP_METHOD -H "Authorization: Bearer $DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN" "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/$OBJECT"
        ```
      scheme: bearer
      type: http
