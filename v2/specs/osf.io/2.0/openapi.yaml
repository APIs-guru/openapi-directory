      Welcome to the Open Science Framework API. With this API you can access users, projects, components, logs, and files from the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/). The Open Science Framework (OSF) is a free, open-source service maintained by the [Center for Open Science](http://cos.io/).

      The OSF serves as a repository and archive for study designs, materials, data, manuscripts, or anything else associated with your research during the research process. Every project and file on the OSF has a permanent unique identifier, and every registration (a permanent, time-stamped version of your projects and files) can be assigned a DOI. You can use the OSF to measure your impact by monitoring the traffic to projects and files you make public. With the OSF you have full control of what parts of your research are public and what remains private.
    name: Introduction
    x-traitTag: true
  - description: |-
      The OSF API generally conforms to the [JSON-API v1.0 spec](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/). Where exceptions exist, they will be noted. Each endpoint will have its own documentation, but there are some general principles.
      Note: Assume undocumented routes/features/fields are unstable.
      #### Canonical URLs
      All canonical URLs have trailing slashes.  A request to an endpoint without a trailing slash will result in a **301 Redirect** to the canonical URL.  There are some exceptions when working with the Files API, so if a URL in a response does not have a slash, do not append one.
      #### Plurals
      Endpoints are always pluralized.  `/users/`, not `/user/`, `/nodes/`, not `/node/`.
      The only exception are the node and preprint citation endpoints, which are `/citation/`, not `/citations/`.
      #### Common Actions
      Every endpoint in the OSF API responds to `GET`, `HEAD`, and `OPTION` requests.
      You must have adequate permissions to interact with any endpoint. Unauthorized use will result in **401 Unauthorized** or **403 Forbidden** responses.
      Use `HEAD` to probe an endpoint and make sure your headers are well-formed. A `GET` request will return a representation of the entity or entity collection referenced by the endpoint.
      An `OPTIONS` request will return a JSON object that describes the endpoint, including the name, a description, the acceptable request formats, the allowed response formats, and any actions available via the endpoint.
      ### Testing
      The OSF provides public testing servers to test integrations against.
      #### Testing Server
      The test-* subdomains of the OSF are intended to match, at any given time, the current production environment of the Open Science Framework.
      We have staging servers that will have newer features, including newer API features, that aren't ready for production. However, because those servers are subject to the whims of QA and whichever group needs to do specific testing, they aren't particular stable for API developers. #### Testing Server
      The `test` subdomains of the OSF are intended to match, at any given time, the current production environment of the OSF. The test servers linked below are primarily for developing your API application on a stable system.
      - Test web server: https://test.osf.io/
      - Test API server: https://api.test.osf.io/v2/
      - Test Files server (known as Waterbutler): https://files.us.test.osf.io/
      #### Ephemerality Notice
      Expect the server to be down from time to time while we update software, and don't expect data to persist indefinitely. We periodically run data migrations on the test servers without notice.

      #### Token Auth
      To use a Personal Access Token, make an `Authorization` header with the contents `Bearer <token>` as shown in the example below, replacing `<token>` with your token.

          curl -X "GET" "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/me/" \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

      To make a Personal Access Token, visit your OSF settings page (either on the [OSF](https://osf.io/settings/tokens/) or our [testing server](https://test.osf.io/settings/tokens/)) to create one. You can limit the scope of the token, but remember that it has access to all of the information that you do within the limits of the scope, so be careful with your tokens.
      #### OAuth
      The OSF allows third-party web applications to connect to the OSF on behalf of other users via the OAuth 2.0 web application flow.
      You can add a developer application from the OSF settings page (either on the [OSF](https://osf.io/settings/tokens/) or our [testing server](https://test.osf.io/settings/tokens/)).

      We will be adding narrative documentation for handling OAuth flows, but for now, if you're familiar with OAuth, you can check out the [CAS overlay documentation](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/cas-overlay#web-server-authorization) for options.
      We've also created a [test application](https://github.com/abought/osf_oauth2_demo) for verifying that our OAuth workflow works correctly. If you set up an OAuth application on https://test.osf.io/, you should be able to add the client secret and client id to the settings file and it should work properly. If it does not, please let us know.

      All entity collection endpoints respond to the `page` query parameter as described in the [JSON-API spec](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-pagination).

      However, links to the first, last, previous, and next pages of results are provided in the `links` key of the response, and you are encouraged to use those rather than adding query parameters by hand.

      If there are only enough results to fill one page, the `first`, `last`, `prev`, and `next` links will be null.
      #### Versioning
      As of version `2.3`, pagination links conform to the JSON API specification. Meta information was pulled out of the `links` object and placed in a top-level `meta` object.

      The `meta` key contains the total number of entities available, as well as the current number of results displayed per page.
    name: Pagination
    x-traitTag: true
  - description: |-
      Versioning can be specified in three different ways:

      #### URL Path Versioning
      + `/v2/` is the only documented path, but only refers to the major version
      + A version specified via the URL path is a **required** part of the URL.
      + Only a major version can be specified via the URL path, i.e. `/v2.0.6/` is invalid, additionally, paths such as `/v2.0/` are invalid.
      + If the default version of the API is within the major version specified in the URL path, the default version will be applied (i.e. if the default version is `2.3` and the URL path is `/v2/`, then version returned will be `2.3`).
      + If the default version of the API is not within the major version specified in the URL path, the URL path version will be applied (i.e. if the default version is `3.0` and the URL path is `/v2/`, then the version returned will be `2.0`)

      #### Query Parameter Versioning
      + `/v2/nodes/?version=2.1.6`
      + Pinning to a specific version via a query parameter is **optional**.
      + A specific version (major, minor, or patch) for a single request can be specified via the `version` query parameter, as long as it is an allowed version.
      + If the version specified in the query parameter does not fall within the same major version specified in the URL path, i.e `/v2/nodes/?version=3.1.4` a 409 Conflict response will be returned.

      #### Header Versioning
      + `Accept-Header=application/vnd.api+json;version=3.0.1`
      + Pinning to a specific version via request header is **optional**.
      + A specific version (major, minor, or patch) for a single request can be specified via the `Accept Header` of the request, as long as it is an allowed version.
      + If the version specified in the header does not fall within the same major version specified in the URL path a 409 Conflict response will be returned.
      + If both a header version and query parameter version are specified, the versions must match exactly or a 409 Conflict response will be returned (i.e. one does not take precedence over the other).

      #### CHANGELOG
      `v2.1`
      + Pagination links conform to JSON API specification, i.e. `meta` information was pulled out of the `links` object and placed in a top-level `meta` object.
      + Deprecate the `node_links` field in the **Node** and **Registration** serializers in favor of `linked_nodes` and `linked_registrations`.

      `v2.2`
      + Modify institution nodes list so that affiliated components are also returned from `/v2/institutions/<id>/nodes/`.
      + Ensure all existing date fields are standardized on UTC.

      `v2.3`
      + Handle merged users more correctly on `/v2/users/`.

      `v2.4`
      + Deprecate the `parents` field in the **Taxonomies** serializer.
      + Deprecate the following fields in the **Preprint Provider** serializer:
          + `social_facebook`, `social_instagram`, and `social_twitter`
          + `banner_path`, `logo_path`, and `header_text`
          + `email_contact`
    name: Versioning
    x-traitTag: true
  - description: |-
      Entity collections can be filtered by adding a query parameter in the form:

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`filter[<fieldname>]=<matching information>`

      String queries are filtered using substring matching. For example, if you were trying to find [Lise Meitner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lise_Meitner):

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/users/?filter[full_name]=meitn`

      You can filter on multiple fields, or the same field in different ways, by &-ing the query parameters together.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/users/?filter[full_name]=lise&filter[family_name]=mei`

      Boolean fields should be queried with `true` or `false`.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/nodes/?filter[registered]=true`

      You can request multiple resources by filtering on id and placing comma-separated values in your query parameter.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/nodes/?filter[id]=aegu6,me23a`

      You can filter with case-sensitivity or case-insensitivity by using `contains` and `icontains`, respectively.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/nodes/?filter[tags][icontains]=help`
    name: Filtering
    x-traitTag: true
  - description: |
      All endpoints respond to the `fields` query parameter as described in the [JSON-API spec](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets).


      From the specification:

      <blockquote>
        <p>A client MAY request that an endpoint return only specific fields in the response on a per-type basis by including a fields[TYPE] parameter.</p>
        <p>The value of the fields parameter MUST be a comma-separated (U+002C COMMA, “,”) list that refers to the name(s) of the fields to be returned.</p>
        <p>If a client requests a restricted set of fields for a given resource type, an endpoint MUST NOT include additional fields in resource objects of that type in its response.</p>
      </blockquote>

      #### Basic Usage

      When making a request to an endpoint that returns a serialized object of some `type`, you can specify `fields[<type>]=<comma,separated,list,of,fields>` to receive a subset of the object's fields in the response.


      For example, the request below will serialize only the `title` attribute and `children` relationship for each node in the response.


      https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/?fields[nodes]=title,children


      Sparse fieldsets can be used to restrict both attribute and relationship fields.
      Note that top-level objects (such as `type`, `id`, `attributes`, `relationships`, and `links`) will always be serialized and cannot be excluded.

      #### Advanced Usage

      Sparse fieldsets can be used to restrict any entity returned in the response.


      For example, the request below will serialize only the `full_name` attribute for each user (auto-embedded by the `embed=contributors` query parameter), and the `title` attribute for each node.


      https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/?fields[nodes]=title,contributors&embed=contributors&fields[users]=full_name


      Any field specified in another query parameters used by the serializer (e.g. `embed`) must also be included in the sparse fieldset.
      For example, fields that are being embedded on the sparse type (e.g. `nodes`) must also be included in `fields[<type>]` when using embeds, or the embed will be invalid.


      A request to embed contributors and restrict nodes to only return the `title` attribute should have the form:


      https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/?embed=contributors&fields[nodes]=title,contributors


      **NOT**


      https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/?embed=contributors&fields[nodes]=title
    name: Sparse Fieldsets
    x-traitTag: true
  - description: |-
      All related resources that appear in the `relationships` attribute are embeddable, meaning it is possible to fetch a node and its contributors in a single request by adding a query parameter like:

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/nodes/?embed=contributors`

      The embedded results will have the following structure:

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`{relationship_name}: {full_embedded_response}`

      Where `full_embedded_response` means the full API response resulting from a **GET** request to the `href` link of the corresponding related resource.

      This means if there are no errors in processing the embedded request the response will have the format:

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`data: {response}`

      And if there are errors processing the embedded request the response will have the format:

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`errors: {errors}`

      Multiple embeds can be achieved with multiple query parameters separated by "&".

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/nodes/?embed=contributors&embed=comments`

      Some endpoints are automatically embedded, such as the [node contributors](#operation/nodes_contributors_list) endpoint, which automatically embeds user information.

    x-traitTag: true
  - description: |-
      ## Attribute Validation
      Endpoints that allow creation or modification of entities generally limit updates to certain attributes of the entity.

      If you attempt to set an attribute that does not permit updates (such as a `date_created` timestamp), the API will silently ignore that attribute.

      This will not affect the response from the API: if the request would have succeeded without the updated attribute, it will still report as successful. Likewise, if the request would have failed without the attribute update, the API will still report a failure.

      Typoed or non-existent attributes will behave the same as non-updatable attributes and will be silently ignored. If a request is not working the way you expect, make sure to double check your spelling.
      ## Create/Update Requests
      #### Formatting POST/PUT/PATCH Request Bodies
      The OSF API follows the JSON-API spec for [create and update requests](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#crud). This means all request bodies must be wrapped with some metadata.

      Each request body must be an object with a `data` key containing at least a `type` member. The value of the `type` member must agree with the `type` of the entities represented by the endpoint. If not, a **409 Conflict** will be returned.

      The request should also contain an `attributes` member with an object containing the key-value pairs to be created/updated.

      **PUT/PATCH** requests must also have an `id` key that matches the ID part of the endpoint you are making a request to. If the `id` key does not match the ID part of the URL path, a **409 Conflict** error will be returned.

      #### Creating a Node via POST Example

          POST /v2/nodes/
          {
            "data": {
              "type": "nodes",
              "attributes": {
                "title" : "A Phylogenetic Tree of Famous Internet Cats",
                "category" : "project",
                "description" : "How closely related are Grumpy Cat and C.H. Cheezburger? Is memefulness inheritable?"
              }
            }
          }


      #### Updating a User via PUT Example

          PUT /v2/users/me/
          {
            "data": {
              "id": "3rqxc",
              "type": "users",
              "attributes": {
                "full_name" : "Henrietta Swan Leavitt",
                "given_name" : "Henrietta",
                "middle_names" : "Swan",
                "family_name" : "Leavitt"
              }
            }
          }

      **Note:** If you PUT/PATCH to the `/users/me/` endpoint, you must still provide your full user id in the `id` field of the request.  We do not support using the `me` alias in request bodies at this time.

      #### PUT vs. PATCH
      For most endpoints that support updates via **PUT** requests, we also allow **PATCH** updates.

      **PUT** requests require all mandatory attributes to be set, even if their value is unchanged. **PATCH** requests may omit mandatory attributes, whose value will be unchanged.
    name: Request Formatting
    x-traitTag: true
  - description: |-
      ## Errors
      When a request fails for any reason, the OSF API will return an appropriate HTTP response code and include a descriptive error in the body of the response.

      The response body will be a JSON object with a key, `errors`, pointing to an array of error objects.

      In general, these error objects will consist of a `detail` key with a detailed error message and a `source` object that may contain a field `pointer` that is a [JSON Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) to the error-causing attribute.

      The `error` objects may include additional information in accordance with the [JSON-API error spec](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#error-objects).

      #### Example
      An error response from an incorrect create node request:

          {
            "errors": [
              {
                "source": {
                  "pointer": "/data/attributes/category"
                },
                "detail": "This field is required."
              },
              {
                "source": {
                  "pointer": "/data/type"
                },
                "detail": "This field may not be null."
              },
              {
                "source": {
                  "pointer": "/data/attributes/title"
                },
                "detail": "This field is required."
              }
            ]
          }

      ## Error Codes
      The OSF API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

      In general, codes in the `2xx` range indicate success, codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, invalid authentication credentials were provided, etc.), and codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with our API servers (these are rare, and if they occur consistently, should be [reported](mailto:support@osf.io)).

      `200` **OK**

      The request was successful and everything worked as expected.

      `201` **Created**

      The request was successful and a new resource was created. The newly created resource can be referenced by the ID returned in the response.

      `204` **No Content**

      The request was sucessful but does not need to return an entity-body.

      `400` **Bad Request**

      The request was unacceptable, often due to a missing required parameter or malformed data.

      `401` **Unauthorized**

      The request requires user authentication, which was not provided.

      `403` **Forbidden**

      The request was understood but not fulfilled, most likely due to invalid permissions.

      `404` **Not Found**

      The requested resource does not exist.

      `405` **Method Not Allowed**

      The method specified in the request is not allowed for the resource.

      `409` **Conflict**

      The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource or within the request data.

      `410` **Gone**

      The requested resource is no longer available, most likely because it was deleted.

      `429` **Too Many Requests**

      The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time.

      Wait at least the amount of time specified in the `Retry-After` header of the response before sending another request.

      Authenticated requests have a rate limit of 10,000/day.

      Unauthenticated requests have a rate limit of 100/hour.

      `5xx` **Server Errors**

      The API server encountered an unexpected error.

  - description: |-
      ## Entities
      An entity is a single resource that has been retrieved from the API, usually from an endpoint with the entity's ID as the final path part. A successful response from an entity request will be a JSON object with a top level `data` key pointing to a sub-object with the following members:
      #### ID
      The identifier for the entity.  This **MUST** be included with all PUT and PATCH requests.
      #### Type
      The type identifier of this entity.  This **MUST** be included with all create and update requests.
      #### Attributes
      The properties of the entity.  Names, descriptions, etc.
      #### Relationships
      Relationships are URLs to other entities or entity collections that have a relationship to the entity.

      For example, the node entity provides a `contributors` relationship that points to the endpoint to retrieve all contributors to that node. It is recommended to use these links rather than to filter general entity collection endpoints by IDs. They'll be faster, easier, and less error-prone.

      Generally a relationship will have the following structure:


          {relationship_name}: {
            "links": {
              "related": {
                "href": {url_to_related_entity_or_entity_collection},
                "meta": {}
              }
            }
          }


      If there are no related entities, `href` will be null.
      #### Embeds
      Please see the [embedding](#tag/Embedding) documentation.
      #### Links
      Links are urls to alternative representations of the entity or actions that may be performed on the entity.

      Most entities will provide a `self` link that is the canonical endpoint for the entity where update and delete requests should be sent. Most entities will also provide an `html` link that directs to the entity's page on the Open Science Framework.
      ## Entity Collections
      Entity collection endpoints return a list of entities and an additional data structure with pagination links, such as `next`, `prev`, `first`, and `last`.

      The OSF API limits all entity collection responses to a maximum of 10 entities.

      The response object has two keys:
      #### Data
      The `data` key is an array of entities that match the query.

      Each entity in the array is the same representation that is returned from that entity's `self` link, meaning that refetching the entity is unnecessary.
      #### Links
      The `links` key contains pagination information, including links to the previous, next, first, and last pages of results.

      The `meta` key contains the total number of entities available, as well as the current number of results displayed per page.
      If there are only enough results to fill one page, the `first`, `last`, `prev`, and `next` values will be null.

      There are a few states for Schema Responses:

        - `initial` is the state of a Schema Response on a newly registered Registration, to edit a Schema Response you
        must create a Schema Response Action that triggers a new submission.

        - `in_progess` is the state of a Schema Response where the response is editable and still private, Schema
        Responses are editted via a PATCH request as specified below.

        - `unapproved` is the state of a Schema Response where edits have been made and "locked-in", now contributors
        have the ability to reject the changes, however if they are not rejected changes are automatically approved
        after 48 hours. If `unapproved` Schema Responses are rejected, they are returned to the `in_progress` state. If
        `unapproved` Schema Responses are approved they either enter an `approved` state or go into a
        `pending_moderation` to be accepted or denied by a moderator.

        - `pending_moderation` is the state of a Schema Response where moderators have an opportunity to reject or
        approve a Schema Response that has been approved by it's contributors. This state is only reachable for Schema
        Responses that are associated with a Registration that has Registration Provider a moderated workflow.

        - `approved` is the state of a Schema Response where it is public and immutable, in order to update an approved
        Schema Response a new one must be created.

      Schema Response Actions are objects that when created cause state transitions for Schema Responses. Users use state transitions to submit, approve, and revise new Schema Responses.

      Schema Response Actions have a  few different triggers to cause state transitions:

        - `submit` is a trigger to transition a Schema Response from an `in_progress` state to an `unapproved` state,
        this freezes edits for the Schema Response and allows all admin contributors to the Schema Response's
        Registration to either approved or reject the Schema Response.

        - `approve` is a trigger to transition a Schema Response from an `unapproved` state to an `approved` state, this
        makes the Schema Response changes public completing the update of the Schema Response. On Schema Responses that
        are associated with a Registration that has Registration Provider a moderated workflow the `approve` trigger
        will transition the Schema Response to `pending_moderation`.

        - `accept` is a trigger to transition a Schema Response from an `pending_moderation` state to an `approved`
        state. This trigger is only valid for Schema Responses that are associated with a Registration that has
        Registration Provider a moderated workflow and only possible for a user designated as moderator of a
        Registration Provider.

        - `admin_reject` is a trigger to transition a Schema Response from an `unapproved` state to an
        `in_progress`  state. This trigger allows users to reject purposed changes to a Schema Response.

        - `moderator_reject` is a trigger to transition a Schema Response from an `pending_moderation` state to an
        `in_progress`  state. This trigger is only valid for Schema Responses that are associated with a Registration
        that has Registration Provider a moderated workflow and only possible for a user designated as moderator of a
        Registration Provider.

      A Draft Registration is a object that allows a user to edit and revise a registration before it is registered. Draft Registrations allow contributors to coordinate on a single registration, so they can upload files and change Registration metadata before the Registration is archived.

        This creates a Draft Registration that can be used to edit and register research.
        Draft Registrations contain Registration questions that will become part of the Registration. A Registration is a frozen version of the project that can never be deleted, but can be withdrawn and have it's metadata edited.
        A Draft Registration created by this endpoint will not have a Project linked with it by default, but if the user includes a `branched_from` attribute in their Draft Registration creation payload with the value of the `branched_from` being guid of a Project they have permissions for the Draft Registration will be linked to the Project. If you linked your Draft Registration on a Project, your original Project remains editable and will now have the Draft Registration linked to it. 
        #### Permissions
        Any user can create a Draft Registration. If the `branched_from` attribute is provided, then the user must be an ADMIN contributor on the Project being registered.
        #### Required
        Required fields for creating a Draft Registration include:

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`schema_id`
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the created Draft Registration, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        Updates a Draft Registration by setting the values of the attributes specified in the request body. Any unspecified attributes will be left unchanged. Note this will not register or change the machine state of a Draft Registration, it can only edit the Draft Registration's attributes prior to its registration.
        #### Permissions
        Only draft registration contributors may view draft registrations and only draft registration contributors with WRITE or ADMIN permissions may update draft registrations.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated draft registration, if the request is successful.
        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        Adds a contributor to a Draft Registration, contributors can view, edit, register or delete a Draft Registration depending on their permissions.
        Contributors are categorized as either "bibliographic" or "non-bibliographic" contributors. From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are listed on the project overview page on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not.
        #### Permissions
        Only project administrators can add contributors to a Draft Registration.
        #### Required
        A relationship object with a `data` key, containing the `users` type and valid user ID is required.
        All attributes describing the relationship between the node and the user are optional.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the new contributor, if the request is successful.
        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        Retrieves the details of a file (or folder)
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the requested file, if the request was successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.
        ### Waterbutler API actions

        Files can be modified through the Waterbutler API routes found in `links` (`new_folder`, `move`, `upload`, `download`, and `delete`).

        #### Download (files)

        To download a file, issue a GET request against the download link. The response will have the Content-Disposition header set, which will will trigger a download in a browser.

        #### Create Subfolder (folders)

        You can create a subfolder of an existing folder by issuing a PUT request against the new_folder link. The ?kind=folder portion of the query parameter is already included in the new_folder link. The name of the new subfolder should be provided in the name query parameter. The response will contain a WaterButler folder entity. If a folder with that name already exists in the parent directory, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response.

        #### Upload New File (folders)


          To upload a file to a folder, issue a PUT request to the folder's upload link with the raw file data in the request body, and the kind and name query parameters set to 'file' and the desired name of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the new file. If a file with the same name already exists in the folder, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response.


        #### Update Existing File (file)

        To update an existing file, issue a PUT request to the file's upload link with the raw file data in the request body and the kind query parameter set to "file". The update action will create a new version of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the updated file.

        #### Rename (files, folders)

        To rename a file or folder, issue a POST request to the move link with the action body parameter set to "rename" and the rename body parameter set to the desired name. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name.

        #### Move & Copy (files, folders)

        Move and copy actions both use the same request structure, a POST to the move url, but with different values for the action body parameters. The path parameter is also required and should be the OSF path attribute of the folder being written to. The rename and conflict parameters are optional. If you wish to change the name of the file or folder at its destination, set the rename parameter to the new name. The conflict param governs how name clashes are resolved. Possible values are replace and keep. replace is the default and will overwrite the file that already exists in the target folder. keep will attempt to keep both by adding a suffix to the new file's name until it no longer conflicts. The suffix will be ' (x)' where x is a increasing integer starting from 1. This behavior is intended to mimic that of the OS X Finder. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name.
        Files and folders can also be moved between nodes and providers. The resource parameter is the id of the node under which the file/folder should be moved. It must agree with the path parameter, that is the path must identify a valid folder under the node identified by resource. Likewise, the provider parameter may be used to move the file/folder to another storage provider, but both the resource and path parameters must belong to a node and folder already extant on that provider. Both resource and provider default to the current node and providers.
        If a moved/copied file is overwriting an existing file, a 200 OK response will be returned. Otherwise, a 201 Created will be returned.

        #### Delete (file, folders)

        To delete a file or folder send a DELETE request to the delete link. Nothing will be returned in the response body.

        A paginated list of licenses. The returned licenses are sorted by their name.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.
        The `data` key contains an array of 10 licenses. Each resource in the array is a separate license object and contains the full representation of the license, meaning additional requests to a license's detail view are not necessary.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        This request should never return an error.
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include licenses that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. [https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/?filter[name]=apache](https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/?filter[name]=apache).

        Licenses may be filtered by their `id`, and `name`.

    get:
      description: |-
        
        A paginated list of nodes, representing projects and components, on the OSF.

        The returned nodes are those which are public or which the user has access to view.

        The returned nodes are sorted by their `date_modified`, with the most recently updated nodes appearing first.

        Registrations cannot be accessed through this endpoint (use the [registrations](#tag/Registrations) endpoints instead).
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of 10 nodes. Each resource in the array is a separate node object and contains the full representation of the node, meaning additional requests to a node's detail view are not necessary.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        This request should never return an error.
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include nodes that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/?filter[title]=reproducibility.

        Nodes may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, `preprint`, and `contributors`.

        Most fields are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching. Public and preprint are boolean fields, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as **true**, **false**, **0** or **1**. Note that quoting true or false in the query will cause the match to fail.

        Creates a new node.

        On the OSF, nodes are considered **projects** or **components**. The difference between a project and a component is that a project is a top-level node, and a component is a child of a project.

        Additionally, nodes have a `category` field that includes **project** as an option. The categorization determines what icon is displayed with the node on the OSF, and helps with search organization. Projects (top-level nodes) may have a category other than project, and components (children) may have a category of **project**.
        #### Required
        Required fields for creating a node include:

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp`title`

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp`category`

        Note: Nodes default to **private** unless the `public` field is explicitly set to **true** in the request payload.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the created node, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        Permanently deletes a node. This action cannot be undone.
        #### Permissions
        Only project administrators may delete a node. Attempting to delete a node for which you are not an administrator will result in a **403 Forbidden** response.
        #### Returns
        If the request is successful, no content is returned.

        If the request is unsuccessful, a JSON object with an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        Retrieves the details of a given node (project or component).
        #### Permissions
        Only project contributors may retrieve the details of a private node. Attempting to retreive a private node for which you are not a contributor will result in a **403 Forbidden** response.

        Authentication is not required to view the details of a public node, as public nodes give read-only access to everyone.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the requested node, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

    patch:

        Updates a node by setting the values of the attributes specified in the request body. Any unspecified attributes will be left unchanged.

        Nodes can be updated with either a **PUT** or **PATCH** request. The `title` and `category` fields are mandatory in a **PUT** request, and optional in a **PATCH**.
        #### Permissions
        Only write contributors may update a node. Attempting to update a node for which you do not have write access will result in a **403 Forbidden** response.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated node, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of at most 10 addon objects. Each resource in the array is a separate addon object and contains the full representation of the addon, meaning additional requests to a addon's detail view are not necessary.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        Retrieve details of an individual addon connected to this node.
        #### Permissions
        NodeSettings that are attached to public nodes will give read-only access to everyone. Private nodes require explicit read permission. Write and admin access are the same for public and private nodes. Administrators on a parent node have implicit read permissions for all child nodes.
        Any users with write or admin access to the node are able to deauthorize an enabled addon, but only the addon authorizer is able to change the configuration (i.e. selected folder) of an already-configured NodeSettings entity.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the details of the requested addon, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

      x-response-schema: Addon
    patch:
      description: |-
        Updates a node addon by setting the values of the attributes specified in the request body. Any unspecified attributes will be left unchanged.

        Node addon can be updated with either a **PUT** or **PATCH** request. The `external_account_id`, `enabled`, and `folder_id` fields are mandatory in a **PUT**, and optional in **PATCH**. Non-string values will be accepted and stringified, however we make no promises about the stringification output.

        To delete or deauthorize a node addon, issue a **PUT** with all fields set to `null` or `False`, or a **PATCH** with enabled set `False`.
        #### Permissions
        NodeSettings that are attached to public nodes will give read-only access to everyone. Private nodes require explicit read permission. Write and admin access are the same for public and private nodes. Administrators on a parent node have implicit read permissions for all child nodes.
        Any users with write or admin access to the node are able to deauthorize an enabled addon, but only the addon authorizer is able to change the configuration (i.e. selected folder) of an already-configured NodeSettings entity.

        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated node addon, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        A paginated list of folders retrieved from the associated third-party (provider) service.
        #### Permissions
        Folders are visible only to the user that authorized the addon.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of addon folder objects. Each resource in the array is a separate addon folder object and contains the full representation of the addon folder, meaning additional requests to a addon folder's detail view are not necessary.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        A paginated list of the next level child nodes for the given node. The returned nodes are sorted by their `date_modified`, with the most recently updated child nodes appearing first.

        The list will include child nodes that are public, as well as child nodes that are private, if the authenticated user has permission to view them.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 child nodes. If the given node has zero child nodes, the `data` key will contain an empty array. Each resource in the array is a separate node object and contains the full representation of the child node, meaning additional requests to the child node's detail view are not necessary.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        This request should never return an error.
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include nodes that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ezcuj/children/?filter[title]=reproducibility.

        Nodes may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, `preprint`, and `contributors`.

        Most fields are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching. Public and preprint are boolean fields, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as **true**, **false**, **0** or **1**. Note that quoting true or false in the query will cause the match to fail.

                          description: Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.

        Creates a new child node.

        Note: Creating a child node via this endpoint will function the same as creating a node via the node list endpoint, but the child node will have the given node set as its parent.
        #### Permissions
        Only write contributors may create children nodes.
        #### Required
        Required fields for creating a node include:

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp`title`

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp`category`

        Note: nodes default to **private** unless the `public` field is explicitly set to **true** in the request payload.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the created node, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        A paginated list of comments related to a given node.

        The returned comments are sorted by their creation date, with the most recent comments appearing first.
        #### Permissions
        Comments on public nodes are given read-only access to everyone.

        If the node comment-level is `private`, only contributors have permission to comment.

        If the comment-level is `public`, any logged-in OSF user can comment.

        Comments on private nodes are only visible to contributors and administrators on the parent node.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of comment objects. Each resource in the array is a separate comment object.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include comments that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ezcuj/comments/?filter[target_id]=jg7sezmdnt93

        Nodes may be filtered by their `deleted`, `target_id`, `date_created`, `date_modified`.

        Most fields are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching. Public and preprint are boolean fields, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as **true**, **false**, **0** or **1**. Note that quoting `true` or `false` in the query will cause the match to fail.

                            We have published a Bayesian reanalysis of this project at PLOS ONE: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0149794

                            I explain some of the context on my blog: http://alexanderetz.com/2016/02/26/the-bayesian-rpp-take-2/

                            Please note that the analysis we use in this paper is very different from the analysis used in the blog I posted in the previous comment, so the results are different as well.

                          content: In this blog http://wp.me/p4sgtg-o6 I conduct a Bayesian Re-analysis of the Reproducibility Project that gives a graded measure of replication success. In an attempt to avoid dichotomous success/fail replication outcomes, I calculate a continous outcome (Bayes factor) that answers the question, does the replication result fit more with the original reported effect or a null effect? Many replications are strong successes, many are strong failures, and there are many that lie somewhere in between.

        Create a comment on a given node overview page or a reply to a comment on that node.

        To create a comment on the node overview page, the target `type` would be "nodes" and the target `id` would be the node `id`.

        To reply to a comment on this node, the target `type` would be "comments" and the target `id` would be the `id` of the comment to reply to.
        #### Required
        A relationship object with a `data` key, containing the target (`comments` or `nodes`) type and a target `id` is required.
        In addition, the `content` attribute describing the relationship between the node and the comment is required.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a data key containing the representation of the new comment, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        A paginated list of the node's contributors, sorted by their index.

        Contributors are users who can make changes to the node or, in the case of private nodes, have read access to the node.

        Contributors are categorized as either "bibliographic" or "non-bibliographic". From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are listed on the project overview page on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not.

        Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used to view the list of contributors, the user relationship will not be exposed and the contributor ID will be an empty string.

        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of 10 contributors. Each resource in the array contains the full representation of the contributor, meaning additional requests to a contributor's detail view are not necessary. Additionally, the full representation of the user this contributor represents is automatically embedded within the `data` key of the response.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include contributors that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y9jdt/contributors/?filter[bibliographic]=true.

        Contributors may be filtered by their `bibliographic` and `permission` attributes.

        Adds a contributor to a node, effectively creating a relationship between the node and a user.

        Contributors are users who can make changes to the node or, in the case of private nodes, have read access to the node.

        Contributors are categorized as either "bibliographic" or "non-bibliographic" contributors. From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are listed on the project overview page on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not.
        #### Permissions
        Only project administrators can add contributors to a node.
        #### Required
        A relationship object with a `data` key, containing the `users` type and valid user ID is required.

        All attributes describing the relationship between the node and the user are optional.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the new contributor, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        Removes a contributor from a node. This request only removes the relationship between the node and the user, it does not delete the user itself.

        A node must always have at least one admin, and attempting to remove the only admin from a node will result in a **400 Bad Request** response.
        #### Permissions
        A user can remove themselves as a node contributor. Otherwise, only project administrators can remove contributors.
        #### Returns
        If the request is successful, no content is returned.

        If the request is unsuccessful, a JSON object with an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        Updates a contributor by setting the values of the attributes specified in the request body. Any unspecified attributes will be left unchanged.

        Contributors can be updated with either a **PUT** or **PATCH** request. Since this endpoint has no mandatory attributes, PUT and PATCH are functionally the same.
        #### Permissions
        Only project administrators can update the contributors on a node.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated contributor, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        If the given user is not already in the contributor list, a 404 Not Found error will be returned. A node must always have at least one admin, and any attempt to downgrade the permissions of a sole admin will result in a 400 Bad Request error.

    get:
      description: |-
        A paginated list of all of the draft registrations of a given node.

        Draft Registrations contain Registration questions that will become part of the Registration. A Registration is a frozen version of the project that can never be deleted, but can be withdrawn and have it's metadata edited.

        Your original project remains editable but will now have the draft registration linked to it.
        #### Permissions
        Only project administrators may view draft registrations.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of 10 draft registrations. Each resource in the array is a separate draft registration object and contains the full representation of the draft registration, meaning additional requests to a draft registration's detail view are not necessary.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        Initiate a draft registration of the current node.
        Draft Registrations contain Registration questions that will become part of the Registration. A Registration is a frozen version of the project that can never be deleted, but can be withdrawn and have it's metadata edited.

        Your original project remains editable but will now have the draft registration linked to it.
        #### Permissions
        Only project administrators may view create registrations.
        #### Required
        Required fields for creating a draft registration include:

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`schema_id`
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the created draft registration, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

    patch:
      description: |-
        Updates a draft registration by setting the values of the attributes specified in the request body. Any unspecified attributes will be left unchanged.

        Draft Registrations contain Registration questions that will become part of the Registration. Answer the questions in the draft registration supplement by sending update requests until you are ready to submit the draft.

        The registration supplement of a draft registration cannot be updated after the draft has been created.

        When updating a draft registration, `registration_metadata` is required. It must be a dictionary with keys as question ids in the registration form, and values as nested dictionaries matching the specific format in the [registration schema](TODO: link me pls).

        If a question is multiple-choice, the question response must exactly match one of the possible choices.
        #### Permissions
        Only project administrators may update draft registrations.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated draft registration, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        List of all storage providers that are configured for this node

        Users of the OSF may access their data on a [number of cloud-storage services](https://api.osf.io/v2/#storage-providers) that have integrations with the OSF. We call these **providers**. By default, every node has access to the OSF-provided storage but may use as many of the supported providers as desired.


        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of files. Each resource in the array is a separate file object.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        Note: In the OSF filesystem model, providers are treated as folders, but with special properties that distinguish them from regular folders. Every provider folder is considered a root folder, and may not be deleted through the regular file API.

    get:
      description: |-
        List of all the files/folders that are attached to your project for a given storage provider.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of files. Each resource in the array is a separate file object and contains the full representation of the file.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        #### Filtering

        You can optionally request that the response only include files that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ezcuj/files/osfstorage/?filter[kind]=file

        Node files may be filtered by `id`, `name`, `node`, `kind`, `path`, `provider`, `size`, and `last_touched`.

        ### Waterbutler API actions

        Files can be modified through the Waterbutler API routes found in `links` (`new_folder`, `move`, `upload`, `download`, and `delete`).

        #### Download (files)

        To download a file, issue a GET request against the download link. The response will have the Content-Disposition header set, which will will trigger a download in a browser.

        #### Create Subfolder (folders)

        You can create a subfolder of an existing folder by issuing a PUT request against the new_folder link. The ?kind=folder portion of the query parameter is already included in the new_folder link. The name of the new subfolder should be provided in the name query parameter. The response will contain a WaterButler folder entity. If a folder with that name already exists in the parent directory, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response.

        #### Upload New File (folders)

        To upload a file to a folder, issue a PUT request to the folder's upload link with the raw file data in the request body, and the kind and name query parameters set to 'file' and the desired name of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the new file. If a file with the same name already exists in the folder, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response.

        #### Update Existing File (file)

        To update an existing file, issue a PUT request to the file's upload link with the raw file data in the request body and the kind query parameter set to "file". The update action will create a new version of the file. The response will contain a WaterButler file entity that describes the updated file.

        #### Rename (files, folders)

        To rename a file or folder, issue a POST request to the move link with the action body parameter set to "rename" and the rename body parameter set to the desired name. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name.

        #### Move & Copy (files, folders)

        Move and copy actions both use the same request structure, a POST to the move url, but with different values for the action body parameters. The path parameter is also required and should be the OSF path attribute of the folder being written to. The rename and conflict parameters are optional. If you wish to change the name of the file or folder at its destination, set the rename parameter to the new name. The conflict param governs how name clashes are resolved. Possible values are replace and keep. replace is the default and will overwrite the file that already exists in the target folder. keep will attempt to keep both by adding a suffix to the new file's name until it no longer conflicts. The suffix will be ' (x)' where x is a increasing integer starting from 1. This behavior is intended to mimic that of the OS X Finder. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name.
        Files and folders can also be moved between nodes and providers. The resource parameter is the id of the node under which the file/folder should be moved. It must agree with the path parameter, that is the path must identify a valid folder under the node identified by resource. Likewise, the provider parameter may be used to move the file/folder to another storage provider, but both the resource and path parameters must belong to a node and folder already extant on that provider. Both resource and provider default to the current node and providers.
        If a moved/copied file is overwriting an existing file, a 200 OK response will be returned. Otherwise, a 201 Created will be returned.

        #### Delete (file, folders)

        To delete a file or folder send a DELETE request to the delete link. Nothing will be returned in the response body.

    get:
      description: |-
        
        A paginated list of the current node's forks. The returned fork nodes are sorted by their `forked_date`, with the most recently forked nodes appearing first.

        Forking a project creates a copy of an existing node and all of its contents. The fork always points back to the original node, forming a network of nodes.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 forked nodes. If the current node has zero forked nodes, the `data` key will contain an empty array. Each resource in the array is a separate node object and contains the full representation of the forked node, meaning additional requests to the forked node's detail view are not necessary.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        This request should never return an error.

    post:

        Creates a fork of the given node.

        Forking a project creates a copy of an existing node and all of its contents. The fork always points back to the original node, forming a network of nodes.

        You might use a fork to copy another's work to build on and extend. For example, a professor may create an OSF project of materials for individual student use. Each student forks the project to have his or her own copy of the materials to start his/her own work.

        When creating a fork, your fork will only contain public components of the current node and components for which you are a contributor. Private components that you do not have access to will not be forked.
        #### Required
        There are no required attributes when creating a fork, as all of the forked node's attributes will be copied from the current node.

        The `title` field is optional, with the default title being "Fork of " prepended to the current node's title.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the complete srepresentation of the forked node, if the request is successful.
        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of identifiers. Each resource in the array is a separate identifier object.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).
        #### Filtering

        You can optionally request that the response only include nodes that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ezcuj/identifiers/?filter[category]=ark

        Identifiers may be filtered by their `category` e.g `ark` or `doi`.

    get:
      description: |-
        List of all nodes linked to the given node.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 nodes. Each resource in the array is a separate node object.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include nodes that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/?filter[title]=reproducibility.

        Nodes may be filtered by their `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `registration`, or `tags`. `title`, `description`, and `category` are string fields and will be filteres using simple substring matching. `public`, `registration` are boolean and can be filtered using truthy values, such as `true`, `false`, `0`, `1`. `tags` is an array of simple strings.

    get:
      description: |-
        A paginated list of all logs associated with a given node.

        The returned logs are sorted by their `date`, with the most recents logs appearing first.

        This list includes the logs of the specified node as well as the logs of that node's children to which the current user has read-only access.

        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 logs. Each resource in the array is a separate logs object.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include logs that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ezcuj/logs/?filter[action]=made_private.

        Nodes may be filtered by their `action`, and `date`.

        List of all registrations of the given node.
        #### Returns

        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 registrations. Each resource in the array is a separate registrations object.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).
        #### Filtering

        You can optionally request that the response only include registrations that match your filters by utilizing the filter query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter[title]=open.

        Registrations may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, and `contributors`.

    get:
      description: |-
        List of view only links on a node.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 view only links. Each resource in the array is a view only link object.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        #### Permissions

        View only links on a node, public or private, are readable and writeable only by users that are administrators on the node.

        #### Filtering

        You can optionally request that the response only include view only links that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ezcuj/view_only_links/?filter[anonymous]=true.

        View Only Links may be filtered based on their `name`, `anonymous` and `date_created` fields. Possible comparison operators include 'gt' (greater than), 'gte'(greater than or equal to), 'lt' (less than) and 'lte' (less than or equal to). The date must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD and the time is optional.

  "/nodes/{node_id}/wikis/":
    get:
      description: |-
        List of wiki pages on a node.
        #### Returns
        Paginated list of the node's current wiki page versions ordered by their date_modified. Each resource contains the full representation of the wiki, meaning additional requests to an individual wiki's detail view are not necessary.

        Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used, the user relationship will not be exposed.

        If the request is unsuccessful, a JSON object with an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.
        #### Filtering
        Wiki pages can be filtered based on their `name` and `date_modified` fields.
        + `filter[name]=<Str>` -- filter wiki pages by name
        + `filter[date_modified][comparison_operator]=YYYY-MM-DDTH:M:S` -- filter wiki pages based on date modified.

        Possible comparison operators include 'gt' (greater than), 'gte'(greater than or equal to), 'lt' (less than) and 'lte' (less than or equal to). The date must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD and the time is optional.

    get:
      description: |-
        
        A paginated list of all preprint providers. The returned preprint providers are sorted by their creation date, with the most recent preprints appearing first.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of 10 preprint providers. Each resource in the array is a separate preprint provider object.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        This request should never return an error.
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include preprint providers that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/preprint_providers/?filter[id]=osf.

        Preprint Providers may be filtered by their `id`, `name`,  and `description`

        Retrieves the details of a preprint provider.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the requested preprint provider, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        #### Acceptable Subjects Structure
        Each preprint provider specifies acceptable subjects.
        `subjects_acceptable` is an array found in `attributes`.
        Subjects consist of general parent subjects (e.g., Engineering), more specific child subjects (e.g., Aerospace Engineering), and even more specific grandchild subjects (e.g., Aerodynamics and Fluid Mechanics). Subjects can only be nested 3 deep.

                    [

                    false
                ]
            ]

        The above structure would allow Architecture, Architectural Engineering, all of Architectural Engineering's children, Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, and Aerodynamics and Fluid Mechanics.

        A paginated list of preprints from the specified preprint provider. The returned preprints are sorted by their creation date, with the most recent preprints appearing first.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of 10 preprints. Each resource in the array is a separate preprint object.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary with keys that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include preprints that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/preprint_providers/osf/preprints/?filter[is_published]=true.

        Preprints may be filtered by their `id`, `is_published`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, and `provider`.

    get:
      description: |-
        A paginated list of the Preprint's Bibliographic Contributors, sorted by their index.
        Contributors are users who can make changes to the Preprint. Contributors with WRITE permissions may edit preprint details, and ADMIN Contributors may add or remove other Contributors.

        Contributors are categorized as either "bibliographic" or "non-bibliographic". From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are listed on the project overview page on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not.

        Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used to view the list of contributors, the user relationship will not be exposed and the contributor ID will be an empty string.

        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of 10 contributors. Each resource in the array contains the full representation of the contributor, meaning additional requests to a contributor's detail view are not necessary. Additionally, the full representation of the user this contributor represents is automatically embedded within the `data` key of the response.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include contributors that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y9jdt/contributors/?filter[bibliographic]=true.

        Contributors may be filtered by their `bibliographic` and `permission` attributes.

  "/preprints/{preprint_id}/contributors/":
    get:
      description: |-
        A paginated list of the Preprint's Contributors, sorted by their index.

        Contributors are users who can make changes to the Preprint. Contributors with WRITE permissions may edit preprint details, and ADMIN Contributors may add or remove other Contributors.

        Contributors are categorized as either "bibliographic" or "non-bibliographic". From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are listed on the project overview page on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not.

        Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used to view the list of Contributors, the user relationship will not be exposed and the Contributor ID will be an empty string.

        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of 10 contributors. Each resource in the array contains the full representation of the contributor, meaning additional requests to a contributor's detail view are not necessary. Additionally, the full representation of the user this contributor represents is automatically embedded within the `data` key of the response.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include contributors that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y9jdt/contributors/?filter[bibliographic]=true.

        Contributors may be filtered by their `bibliographic` and `permission` attributes.

      summary: List all Contributors for a Preprint
      tags:
        - Preprints
      x-response-schema: Contributor
    post:
      description: |-
        Adds a contributor to a Preprint, effectively creating a relationship between the Preprint and a user.

        Contributors are users who can make changes to the Preprint. Contributors with WRITE permissions may edit preprint details, and ADMIN Contributors may add or remove other Contributors.

        Contributors are categorized as either "bibliographic" or "non-bibliographic" contributors. From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are listed on the project overview page on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not.
        #### Permissions
        Only project administrators can add contributors to a Preprint.
        #### Required
        A relationship object with a `data` key, containing the `users` type and valid user ID is required.

        All attributes describing the relationship between the Preprint and the user are optional.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the new contributor, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

    get:
      description: |-
        A paginated list of registrations on the OSF to which the user has access.

        The returned registrations are those which are public or which the user has access to view.

        Non-registered nodes cannot be accessed through this endpoint (use the [nodes](#Nodes_nodes_list) endpoints instead).

        #### Registrations
        A registration on the OSF creates a frozen, time-stamped version of a project that cannot be edited or deleted. The *original project* can still be edited, while the registered version cannot.

        Registrations can be made public immediately or embargoed for up to 4 years.

        #### Withdrawals
        Registrations cannot be deleted, but they can be withdrawn. Withdrawing a registration removes the content of the registration but leaves behind basic metadata. A withdrawn registration will display a limited subset of information, namely, title, description, date_created, date_registered, date_withdrawn, registration, withdrawn, withdrawal_justification, and registration supplement. All other fields will be displayed as null. Additionally, the only relationship that remains accesible for a withdrawn registration is the contributors. All other relationships will return a **403 Forbidden** response.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of 10 registrations. Each resource in the array is a separate registration object and contains the full representation of the registration, meaning additional requests to a registration's detail view are not necessary.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        This request should never return an error.
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include registrations that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter[title]=open.

        Registrations may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, and `contributors`.

    get:
      description: |-
        Retrieve the details of a given registration.
        #### Permissions
        Only project contributors may retrieve the details of a registration that is embargoed, or has not yet been made public. Attempting to retrieve a private registration for which you are not a contributor will result in a **403 Forbidden** response.

        Authentication is not required to view the details of a public registration, as public registrations give read-only access to everyone.
        #### Registrations
        A registration on the OSF creates a frozen, time-stamped version of a project that cannot be edited or deleted. The *original project* can still be edited, while the registered version cannot.

        Registrations can be made public immediately or embargoed for up to 4 years.

        #### Withdrawals
        Registrations cannot be deleted, but they can be withdrawn. Withdrawing a registration removes the content of the registration but leaves behind basic metadata. A withdrawn registration will display a limited subset of information, namely, title, description, date_created, date_registered, date_withdrawn, registration, withdrawn, withdrawal_justification, and registration supplement. All other fields will be displayed as null. Additionally, the only relationship that remains accesible for a withdrawn registration is the contributors. All other relationships will return a **403 Forbidden** response.

        Updates a registration's privacy from **private** to **public**.

        Registrations can be updated with either a **PUT** or **PATCH** request. The `public` field is the only field that can be modified on a registration

        Registrations can only be turned from private to public, not vice versa.
        #### Permissions
        Only project administrators may update a registration.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated registration, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

    get:

        A paginated list of children of a registration.

        The list consists of the next level child registrations for the given registration. The returned registrations are sorted by their `date_modified`, with the most recently updated child registrations appearing first.

        The list will include child registrations that are public, as well as child registrations that are private, if the authenticated user has permission to view them.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 child registrations. If the given registration has zero child registrations, the `data` key will contain an empty array. Each resource in the array is a separate registration object and contains the full representation of the child registration.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include registrations that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wucr8/children/?filter[title]=reproducibility.

        Registrations may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, and `contributors`.

        Most fields are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching. Public is a boolean field, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as **true**, **false**, **0** or **1**. Note that quoting true or false in the query will cause the match to fail.

        A paginated list of the registration's alternative citation styles

        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 citation styles. Each resource in the array is a separate citation styles object.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include citation styles that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wucr8/citations/?filter[title]=open.

        Citation styles may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `short-title`, and `summary`.

      x-response-schema: Citation Detail
  "/registrations/{registration_id}/comments/":
    get:
      description: |-
        
        A paginated list of the registration's comments.

        The returned comments are sorted by their creation date, with the most recent comments appearing first.
        #### Permissions
        Comments of public registrations are given read-only access to everyone.

        If the comment-level is `private`, only registration contributors have permission to comment.

        If the comment-level is `public`, any logged-in OSF user can comment.

        Comments of private registrations are only visible to contributors and administrators on the registration.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of comment objects. Each resource in the array is a separate comment object.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include comments that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wuerf/comments/?filter[target]=wuerf

        Comments may be filtered by their `deleted`, `target`, `date_created`, `date_modified`.

        Most fields are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching. Deleted is a boolean field, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as **true**, **false**, **0** or **1**. Note that quoting `true` or `false` in the query will cause the match to fail.

                            We have published a Bayesian reanalysis of this project at PLOS ONE: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0149794

                            I explain some of the context on my blog: http://alexanderetz.com/2016/02/26/the-bayesian-rpp-take-2/

                            Please note that the analysis we use in this paper is very different from the analysis used in the blog I posted in the previous comment, so the results are different as well.

                          content: In this blog http://wp.me/p4sgtg-o6 I conduct a Bayesian Re-analysis of the Reproducibility Project that gives a graded measure of replication success. In an attempt to avoid dichotomous success/fail replication outcomes, I calculate a continous outcome (Bayes factor) that answers the question, does the replication result fit more with the original reported effect or a null effect? Many replications are strong successes, many are strong failures, and there are many that lie somewhere in between.

  "/registrations/{registration_id}/contributors/":
    get:
      description: |-
        A paginated list of all contributors on this registration.
        The returned contributors are sorted by their index.

        Contributors are users who can make changes to the registration or, in the case of private registration, have read access to the registration.

        Contributors are categorized as either "bibliographic" or "non-bibliographic". From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are listed in the contributors list on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not.

        Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used to view the list of contributors, the user relationship will not be exposed and the contributor ID will be an empty string.

        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 contributors. Each resource in the array contains the full representation of the contributor. Additionally, the full representation of the user this contributor represents is automatically embedded within the `data` key of the response.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include contributors that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wu3a4/contributors/?filter[bibliographic]=true.

        Contributors may be filtered by their `bibliographic` and `permission` attributes.

        A paginated list of storage providers enabled on the registration

        Users of the OSF may access their data on a [number of cloud-storage services](https://api.osf.io/v2/#storage-providers) that have integrations with the OSF. We call these **providers**. By default, every node has access to the OSF-provided storage but may use as many of the supported providers as desired.


        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 files. Each resource in the array is a separate file object.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        Note: In the OSF filesystem model, providers are treated as folders, but with special properties that distinguish them from regular folders. Every provider folder is considered a root folder, and may not be deleted through the regular file API.

        List of all the registration's files/folders for a given storage provider.

        #### Returns

        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of files. Each resource in the array is a separate file object and contains the full representation of the file.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        #### Filtering

        You can optionally request that the response only include files that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wucr8/files/osfstorage/?filter[kind]=file

        Files may be filtered by `id`, `name`, `node`, `kind`, `path`, `provider`, `size`, and `last_touched`.

    get:

        A paginated list of the registration’s forks

        The returned forks are sorted by their `forked_date`, with the most recent forks appearing first.

        Forking a registration creates a copy of an existing registration and all of its contents.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 forks. If the current registration has no fork, the `data` key will contain an empty array. Each resource in the array is a separate registration object and contains the full representation of the registration's fork.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        Creates a fork of the given registration.

        Forking a project creates a copy of an existing registration and all of its contents. The fork always points back to the original registration, forming a network of registrations.

        You might use a fork to copy another's work to build on and extend. For example, a professor may create an OSF project of materials for individual student use. Each student forks the project to have his or her own copy of the materials to start his/her own work.

        When creating a fork, your fork will only contain public components of the current registration and components for which you are a contributor. Private components that you do not have access to will not be forked.
        #### Required
        There are no required attributes when creating a fork, as all of the forked registration's attributes will be copied from the current registration.

        The `title` field is optional, with the default title being "Fork of " prepended to the current registration's title.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the complete representation of the forked registration, if the request is successful.
        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        A paginated list of the registration's identifiers.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of identifiers. Each resource in the array is a separate identifier object.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).
        #### Filtering

        You can optionally request that the response only include registrations that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wucr8/identifiers/?filter[category]=ark

        Identifiers may be filtered by their `category` e.g `ark` or `doi`.

        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 nodes. Each resource in the array is a separate node object.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include nodes that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wucr8/linked_nodes/?filter[title]=reproducibility/?filter[title]=reproducibility.

        Nodes may be filtered by their `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `registration`, or `tags`. `title`, `description`, and `category` are string fields and will be filteres using simple substring matching. `public`, `registration` are boolean and can be filtered using truthy values, such as `true`, `false`, `0`, `1`. `tags` is an array of simple strings.

        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 logs. Each resource in the array is a separate logs object.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include logs that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wucr8/logs/?filter[action]=made_private.

        Logs may be filtered by their `action`, and `date`.

    get:
      description: |-
        A paginated list of view only links created for this registration.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 view only links. Each resource in the array is a view only link object.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        #### Permissions

        View only links on a registration, public or private, are readable and writeable only by users that are administrators on the registration.

        #### Filtering

        You can optionally request that the response only include view only links that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wu3a4/view_only_links/?filter[anonymous]=true.

        View Only Links may be filtered based on their `name`, `anonymous` and `date_created` fields. Possible comparison operators include 'gt' (greater than), 'gte'(greater than or equal to), 'lt' (less than) and 'lte' (less than or equal to). The date must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD and the time is optional.

        A paginated list of the registration's wiki pages
        #### Returns
        A list of all registration's current wiki page versions ordered by their date_modified. Each resource contains the full representation of the wiki, meaning additional requests to an individual wiki's detail view are not necessary.

        If the request is unsuccessful, a JSON object with an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.
        #### Filtering
        Wiki pages can be filtered based on their `name` and `date_modified` fields.
        + `filter[name]=<Str>` -- filter wiki pages by name
        + `filter[date_modified][comparison_operator]=YYYY-MM-DDTH:M:S` -- filter wiki pages based on date modified.

        Possible comparison operators include 'gt' (greater than), 'gte'(greater than or equal to), 'lt' (less than) and 'lte' (less than or equal to). The date must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD and the time is optional.

  /users/:
    get:
      description: |-
        
        A paginated list of all users registered on the OSF. The returned users are sorted by their `date_registered`, with the most recently registered users appearing first.

        The subroute `/users/me/` is a special endpoint that always points to the currently logged-in user.
        #### Versioning
        As of version `2.3`, merged users will not be returned from this endpoint.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of 10 users. Each resource in the array is a separate users object and contains the full representation of the user, meaning additional requests to a user's detail view are not necessary.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        This request should never return an error.
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include nodes that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/users/?filter[family_name]=Nosek.

        Users may be filtered by their `id`, `full_name`, `given_name`, `middle_name`, or `family_name`.

    patch:
      description: |-
        Updates a user by setting the values of the attributes specified in the request body. Any unspecified attributes will be left unchanged.

        Users can be updated with either a **PUT** or **PATCH** request. The `full_name` field is mandatory in a **PUT** request, and optional in a **PATCH**.

        **Note**: if you make a PUT/PATCH request to the `/users/me/` endpoint, you must still provide your full user ID in the ID field of the request. We do not support using the `me` alias in request bodies at this time.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated node, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        The `data` key contains an array of 10 nodes. Each resource in the array is a separate node object and contains the full representation of the node, meaning additional requests to a node's detail view are not necessary.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include nodes that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/users/cdi38/nodes/?filter[title]=open.

        Nodes may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, `preprint`, and `contributors`.

  "/users/{user_id}/preprints/":
    get:
      description: |-
        A paginated list of preprints that the user contributes to. The returned preprints are sorted by their creation date, with the most recent preprints appearing first.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of 10 preprints. Each resource in the array is a complete preprint object and contains the full representation of the preprint, meaning additional requests to a preprint's detail view are not necessary.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include preprints that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/users/cdi38/preprints/?filter[provider]=psyarxiv.

        Preprints may be filtered by their `id`, `is_published`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, and `provider`.

    get:
      description: |-
        A paginated list of registrations that the user is a contributor to. The returned registrations are sorted by their `date_modified`, with the most recently updated registrations appearing first.

        If the user ID in the path is the same as the logged-in user, all registrations will be returned. Otherwise, only the user's public registrations will be returned.

        User nodes are not available at this endpoint.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of 10 registrations. Each resource in the array is a separate registration object and contains the full representation of the registration, meaning additional requests to a registration's detail view are not necessary.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include registrations that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/users/cdi38/registrations/?filter[title]=replication.

        Registrations may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, and `contributors`.

        The list of nodes which this view only link gives read-only access to.
        #### Permissions
        Only project administrators may retrieve the nodes of a view only link. Attempting to retrieve a view only link without appropriate permissions will result in a 403 Forbidden response.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.
        The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 nodes. Each resource in the array is a separate node object and contains the full representation of the node, meaning additional requests to a node's detail view are not necessary.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.
