E.g., a carton with dimensions 10" x 10" x 13.9" would yield a volume of 1390 cubic inches. This yields <pre>cartonEffectiveMinimumWeight = 1390in&sup3; / 139in&sup3;/lb<br/>cartonEffectiveMinimumWeight = 10lbs</pre>

      priceIncreaseRate:
        description: Instead of providing the full rate table, you can list a carton "basePrice" and a carton "priceIncreaseRate". These two values will be used in a simple linear model to guess carton price, i.e., <pre>cartonPrice = priceIncreaseRate * cartonWeight + basePrice</pre> Oftentimes, this will be enough to get accurate carton selections without needing to send complete customer-based rates. It's worth considering, as the prices are only estimates to be used in carton selection, with final rating of cartons happening outside of paccurate. This is the predicted rate of increase for a weight-based pricing model. The simplest way to find a servicable value is to take <pre>priceIncreaseRate = (maximumPrice - minimumPrice)/(maximumWeight - minimumWeight)</pre> In the example above, this would yield <pre>priceIncreaseRate = ($20-$10)/(3lbs-1lb)<br/>priceIncreaseRate = $10/2lbs<br/>priceIncreaseRate = $5/lb</pre>

        description: list of weights to use for the rate that corresponds to its index, e.g., [1, 2, 3] would mean 1lb for the minimum rate ($10), 2lbs for the second rate ($15), and 3lbs for the highest rate ($20). Note that if the highest value from this list is less than the weightMax of the carton, all carton weights exceeding the maximum from this list up to the carton weightMax will not pro-rate but will be estimated at the maximum value in the rate table.

                  <h4>"nesting"</h4> 
                  <p>"nesting" is where the first item has full dimensions, and subsequent items have diminished dimensions. E.g.,
                  a flower pot may have dimensions of 6" x 6" x 6", but additional flower pots can nest in the first pot, and have
                  effective dimensions of 1" x 6" x 6". These cases are almost always have a single direction that nesting can occur
                  in--two pots must both be right-side up and one on top of the other if they are to nest--so the rule options must
                  reflect these restrictions.<p/>

                  <h4>"roll"</h4> 
                  <p>A rolled irregular item is simply where the item dimensions X, Y, and Z, represent the thickness, width, and total
                  length of a material meant to be rolled up (possibly on a spool, dowel, etc.) and shipped as such. Marked this way, the bounding box
                  of the roll cylinder will be used as its shipping dimensions. E.g., a roll has a width 60 inches and a diameter of 12 inches,
                  it will be shipped as if it were a 12" x 12" x 60" item. Rolls can have a maximum allowable diameter, and any rolls that must be
                  split will have their weights calculated on a pro-rated basis of the total length and weight in the item contents.<p/>
