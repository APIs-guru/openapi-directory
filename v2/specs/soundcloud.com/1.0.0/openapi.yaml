        <h3>Security Advice</h3>
        * Using the [implicit OAuth authorization flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-16#section-2.1.2) (`response_type=token`)  is **not recommended**. It can suffer from access token leakage and access token replay attacks. Use `response_type=code` instead.
        * Use the `state` parameter for [CSRF protection](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-16#section-4.7). Pass a sufficient  random nonce here and verify this nonce again after retrieving the token.
