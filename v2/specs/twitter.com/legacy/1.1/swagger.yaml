        image URL. You can either update your local cache the next time you request the user's information,

        Returns the

        methods belonging to the specified resource families.

        Each 1.1 API resource belongs to a "resource family" which is indicated in its method documentation.
        You can typically determine a method's resource family from the first component of the path after
        the resource version.

        This method responds with a map of methods belonging to the families specified by the resources
        parameter, the current remaining uses for each of those resources within the current rate limiting
        window, and its expiration time in epoch time. It also includes a rate_limit_context field that
        indicates the current access token context.

        You may also issue requests to this method without any parameters to receive a map of all rate
        limited GET methods. If your application only uses a few of methods, please explicitly provide a
        resources parameter with the specified resource families you work with.

        Creates a new place object at the
        given latitude and longitude.

        Before creating a place you need to query GET geo/similar_places with the latitude, longitude and
        name of the place you wish to create. The query will return an array of places which are similar to
        the one you wish to create, and a token. If the place you wish to create isn't in the returned array
        you can use the token with this method to create a new one.

        Search for places that can be

        request will return a list of all the valid places that can be used as the place_id when updating a
        status.

        Conceptually, a query can be made from the user's location, retrieve a list of places, have the user
        validate the location he or she is at, and then send the ID of this location with a call to POST
        statuses/update.

        This is the recommended method to use find places that can be attached to statuses/update. Unlike
        GET geo/reverse_geocode which provides raw data access, this endpoint can potentially re-order
        places with regards to the user who is authenticated. This approach is also preferred for
        interactive place matching with the user.

        Removes multiple
        members from a list, by specifying a comma-separated list of member ids or screen names. The
        authenticated user must own the list to be able to remove members from it. Note that lists can't
        have more than 500 members, and you are limited to removing up to 100 members to a list at a time
        with this method.

        Please note that there can be issues with lists that rapidly remove and add memberships. Take care
        when using these methods such that you are not too rapidly switching between removals and adds on
        the same list.

        In API v1.1, the response format of the Search API has been improved to return Tweet objects more
        similar to the objects you'll find across the REST API and platform. You may need to tolerate some

        Updates the
        authenticating user's status and attaches media for upload. Unlike POST statuses/update
        (https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/post/statuses/update), this method expects raw multipart data.
        Your POST request's Content-Type should be set to multipart/form-data with the media[] parameter.
        The Tweet text will be rewritten to include the media URL(s), which will reduce the number of
        characters allowed in the Tweet text. If the URL(s) cannot be appended without text truncation, the
        tweet will be rejected and this method will return an HTTP 403 error. Important: Make sure that
        you're using upload.twitter.com as your host while posting statuses with media. It is strongly
        recommended to use SSL with this method.

        Returns the 20 most
        recent statuses posted by the authenticating user. It is also possible to request another user's
        timeline by using the screen_name or user_id parameter. The other users timeline will only be
        visible if they are not protected, or if the authenticating user's follow request was accepted by
        the protected user. The timeline returned is the equivalent of the one seen when you view a user's
        profile on twitter.com. This method can only return up to 3,200 of a user's most recent statuses.
        Native retweets of other statuses by the user is included in this total, regardless of whether
        include_rts is specified when requesting this resource. This method will not include retweets in the
        XML and JSON responses unless the include_rts parameter is set. The RSS and Atom responses will
        always include retweets as statuses prefixed with RT, regardless of provided parameters. Always
        specify either an user_id or screen_name when requesting a user timeline.
