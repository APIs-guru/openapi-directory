    This API allows you to interact with the VictorOps platform in various ways. Your account may be limited
    to a total number of API calls per month. Also, some of these API calls have rate limits.

    NOTE: In this documentation when creating a sample curl request (clicking the TRY IT OUT! button), in some API
    viewing interfaces, the '@' in an email address may be encoded. Please note that the REST endpoints will not
    process the encoded version. Make sure that the encoded character '%40' is changed to its unencoded form before
    submitting the curl request.

        __NOTE: This call is deprecated. Please use `GET /api-reporting/v2/incidents`.__

        Retrieve incident history for your company, searching over date ranges and with filtering options.  This is historical
        data, and may be up to 15 minutes behind real-time incident data.  By default, only resolved incidents will be returned.

        This API may be called a maximum of once a minute.

        Incident requests are paginated with a offset and limit query string parameters.
          The query for incidents is run and offset records are skipped, after which limit records will be returned.

        The default offset is 0 and the default limit is 20. The maximum value allowed for limit is 100.

        On return, the total number of records available for that query will be returned in the payload as 'total'.

    get:
      description: |
        Retrieve incident history for your company, searching over date ranges and with filtering options.

        This API may be called a maximum of once a minute.

        Incident requests are paginated with a offset and limit query string parameters.
          The query for incidents is run and offset records are skipped, after which limit records will be returned.

        The default offset is 0 and the default limit is 20. The maximum value allowed for limit is 100.

        Unless specified otherwise with the parameter currentPhase, the response will only contain resolved incidents.

        On return, the total number of records available for that query will be returned in the payload as 'total'.
