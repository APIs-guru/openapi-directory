    Adyen Checkout API provides a simple and flexible way to initiate and authorise online payments. You can use the same integration for payments made with cards (including 3D Secure), mobile wallets, and local payment methods (for example, iDEAL and Sofort).

    This API reference provides information on available endpoints and how to interact with them. To learn more about the API, visit [online payments documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments).

    ## Authentication
    Each request to Checkout API must be signed with an API key. For this, [get your API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key) from your Customer Area, and set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:

    ```
    curl
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
    ...
    ```
    ## Versioning
    Checkout API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.

    For example:
    ```
    https://checkout-test.adyen.com/v37/payments
    ```

    ## Going live

    To access the live endpoints, you need an API key from your live Customer Area.

    The live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account, for example:
    ```
    https://{PREFIX}-checkout-live.adyenpayments.com/checkout/v37/payments
    ```

    Get your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**.

    When preparing to do live transactions with Checkout API, follow the [go-live checklist](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/go-live-checklist) to make sure you've got all the required configuration in place.

        You need to use this endpoint if you have an API-only integration with Apple Pay which uses Adyen's Apple Pay certificate.

        The endpoint returns the Apple Pay session data which you need to complete the [Apple Pay session validation](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/apple-pay/api-only?tab=adyen-certificate-validation_1#complete-apple-pay-session-validation).

        Cancels the authorisation on a payment that has not yet been [captured](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments/{paymentPspReference}/captures), and returns a unique reference for this request. You get the outcome of the request asynchronously, in a [**TECHNICAL_CANCEL** webhook](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/cancel#cancellation-webhook).

        If you want to cancel a payment using the [`pspReference`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments__resParam_pspReference), use the [`/payments/{paymentPspReference}/cancels`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments/{paymentPspReference}/cancels) endpoint instead.

        If you want to cancel a payment but are not sure whether it has been captured, use the [`/payments/{paymentPspReference}/reversals`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments/{paymentPspReference}/reversals) endpoint instead.

        For more information, refer to [Cancel](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/cancel).

        Send a request with at least the first 6 digits of the card number to get a response with an array of brands on the card. If you include [your supported brands](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/cardDetails__reqParam_supportedBrands) in the request, the response also tells you if you support each [brand that was identified](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/cardDetails__resParam_details).

        If you have an API-only integration and collect card data, use this endpoint to find out if the shopper's card is co-branded. For co-branded cards, you must let the shopper choose the brand to pay with  if you support both brands.

Besides giving back a list of the available payment methods, the response also returns which input details you need to collect from the shopper (to be submitted to `/payments`).

        Although we highly recommend using this endpoint to ensure you are always offering the most up-to-date list of payment methods, its usage is optional. You can, for example, also cache the `/paymentMethods` response and update it once a week.

        The response depends on the [payment flow](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods#payment-flow):
        * For a direct flow, the response includes a `pspReference` and a `resultCode` with the payment result, for example **Authorised** or **Refused**. 
        * For a redirect or additional action, the response contains an `action` object.

         Captures an authorised payment and returns a unique reference for this request. You get the outcome of the request asynchronously, in a [**CAPTURE** webhook](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/capture#capture-notification).

        You can capture either the full authorised amount or a part of the authorised amount. By default, any unclaimed amount after a partial capture gets cancelled. This does not apply if you enabled multiple partial captures on your account and the payment method supports multiple partial captures. 

        [Automatic capture](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/capture#automatic-capture) is the default setting for most payment methods. In these cases, you don't need to make capture requests. However, making capture requests for payments that are captured automatically does not result in double charges.

        Refunds a payment that has been [captured](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments/{paymentPspReference}/captures), and returns a unique reference for this request. You get the outcome of the request asynchronously, in a [**REFUND** webhook](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/refund#refund-webhook).

        You can refund either the full captured amount or a part of the captured amount. You can also perform multiple partial refunds, as long as their sum doesn't exceed the captured amount.

        > Some payment methods do not support partial refunds. To learn if a payment method supports partial refunds, refer to the payment method page such as [cards](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/cards#supported-cards), [iDEAL](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/ideal), or [Klarna](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/klarna). 

        If you want to refund a payment but are not sure whether it has been captured, use the [`/payments/{paymentPspReference}/reversals`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments/{paymentPspReference}/reversals) endpoint instead.

        For more information, refer to [Refund](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/refund).

            * **NO_CONNECTION_AVAILABLE** – There wasn't a connection available to service the outgoing communication.
            This is a transient, retriable error since no messaging could be initiated to an issuing system (or third-party acquiring system). Therefore, the header Transient-Error: true is returned in the response. A subsequent request using the same idempotency key will be processed as if it was the first request.
            * **IOEXCEPTION_RECEIVED** – Something went wrong during transmission of the message or receiving the response.
            This is a classified as non-transient because the message could have been received by the issuing party and been acted upon. No transient error header is returned. If using idempotency, the (error) response is stored as the final result for the idempotency key. Subsequent messages with the same idempotency key not be processed beyond returning the stored response.
