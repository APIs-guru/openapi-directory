    The Configuration API enables you to create a platform where you can onboard your users as account holders and create balance accounts, cards, and business accounts.

    ## Authentication
    Your Adyen contact will provide your API credential and an API key. To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:

     ```
    curl
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
    ...
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication. For example:

    ```
    curl
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -U "ws@BalancePlatform.YOUR_BALANCE_PLATFORM":"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD" \
    ...
    ```
    ## Versioning
    The Configuration API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.

    For example:
    ```
    https://balanceplatform-api-test.adyen.com/bcl/v1/accountHolders
    ```
    ## Going live
    When going live, your Adyen contact will provide your API credential for the live environment. You can then use the API key or the username and password to send requests to `https://balanceplatform-api-live.adyen.com/bcl/v1`.

        Creates a transfer instrument. 

        A transfer instrument is a bank account that a legal entity owns. Adyen performs verification checks on the transfer instrument as required by payment industry regulations. We inform you of the verification results through webhooks or API responses.

        When the transfer instrument passes the verification checks, you can start sending funds from the balance platform to the transfer instrument (such as payouts).
