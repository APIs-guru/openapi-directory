    This API is used for the classic integration. If you are just starting your implementation, refer to our [new integration guide](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms) instead.

    The Account API provides endpoints for managing account-related entities on your platform. These related entities include account holders, accounts, bank accounts, shareholders, and verification-related documents. The management operations include actions such as creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of them.

    For more information, refer to our [documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/classic).
    ## Authentication
    Your Adyen contact will provide your API credential and an API key. To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:

     ```
    curl
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
    ...
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication. For example:

    ```
    curl
    -U "ws@MarketPlace.YOUR_PLATFORM_ACCOUNT":"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    ...
    ```
    When going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).

    ## Versioning
    The Account API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.

    For example:
    ```
    https://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Account/v3/createAccountHolder
    ```

        Changes the [status of an account holder](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/classic/account-holders-and-accounts#account-holder-statuses) from **Suspended** to **Inactive**. 
        Account holders can have a **Suspended** [`status`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/Account/latest/post/getAccountHolder__resParam_verification-accountHolder-checks-status) if you suspend them through the [`/suspendAccountHolder`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/Account/v5/post/suspendAccountHolder) endpoint or if a verification deadline expires.

        You can only unsuspend account holders if they do not have verification checks with a **FAILED** [`status`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/Account/latest/post/getAccountHolder__resParam_verification-accountHolder-checks-status).

        Updates the `accountHolderDetails` and `processingTier` of an account holder, and adds bank accounts and shareholders.

        When updating `accountHolderDetails`, parameters that are not included in the request are left unchanged except for the following object:

        * `metadata`: Updating the metadata replaces the entire object. This means that to update an existing key-value pair, you must provide the changes, as well as other existing key-value pairs.

        When updating any field in the following objects, you must submit all the fields required for validation:

         * `address`

        * `fullPhoneNumber`

        * `bankAccountDetails.BankAccountDetail`

        * `businessDetails.shareholders.ShareholderContact`

         For example, to update the `address.postalCode`, you must also submit the `address.country`, `.city`, `.street`, `.postalCode`, and possibly `.stateOrProvince` so that the address can be validated.

        To add a bank account or shareholder, provide the bank account or shareholder details without a `bankAccountUUID` or a `shareholderCode`.
