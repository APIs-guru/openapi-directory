    This is the official API documentation for ClickSend.com

    Below you will find a current list of the available methods for clicksend.

    **NOTE**: You will need to create a free account to use the API.

    You can
    [**Register Here**](https://dashboard.clicksend.com/#/signup/step1/).

    # API URL

    The API should always be accessed over SSL.

    Base URL: `https://rest.clicksend.com/v3/`

    # Authentication

    Basic HTTP authentication should be used in the header.

    **Either:**

    `username`: Your API username

    `password`: Your API key

    ```
    You can get your API credentials by clicking 'API Credentials' on the top right of the dashboard.
    ```

    **OR**

    `username`: Your account username

    `password`: Your account password

    ```
    These are the same credentials that you use to login to the dashboard.
    ```

    ### Authorization Header

    The Authorization header is constructed as follows:
    1. Username and password are combined into a string `username:password`
    1. The resulting string is then encoded using Base64 encoding
    1. The authorization method and a space i.e. "Basic " is then put before the encoded string.

    For example, if the user uses `Aladdin` as the username and `open sesame` as the password then the header is formed as follows:

    `Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==`

    ### PHP Authentication Header Example (using cURL)

    `curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, ['Authorization: Basic ' . base64_encode("$username:$password")]);`

    # Searching and Sorting

    Most GET endpoints allow searching and sorting. Searches are **not** case-sensitive.

    ## Search

    To perform a search, add `q` as a query parameter. For example:

    `/subaccounts?q=field:value,field2:value`

    ## Order

    To perform a sort, add `order_by` as a query parameter. For example:

    `/subaccounts?order_by=field:desc/asc`

    ## AND / OR

    By default, it will search using the `AND` operator. This can be set using `operator` as a query parameter. For example:

    `/subaccounts?q=field:value&operator=OR`

    **Options:**

    - `AN` - returns results matching **all** query fields specified

    - `OR` - returns results matching **any** query fields specified

    ## Example

    `/subaccounts?q=first_name:john,last_name:smith&order_by=subaccount_id:asc&operator=AND`

    # CORS

    When creating your API app, specify the JavaScript (CORS) origins you'll be using. We use these origins to return the headers needed for CORS.

    # Date and Time

    All date/timestamps will be returned in Unix time (also known as POSIX time or erroneously as Epoch time) with no leap seconds.

    For example: `1435255816`

    ```
    (ISO 8601: 2015-06-25T18:10:16Z)
    ```

    More information: [Wikipedia: Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

    There is ony one Unix time and it is created by using the UTC/GMT time zone. This means you might have convert time zones to calculate timestamps. Most programming language have libraries to help you converting time zones.

    **The current Unix time can be found here:** [Epoch Converter](http://www.epochconverter.com)

      # What is it?

      Geolocation allows you to send an SMS to a handset with a URL in the message. When the user taps on the URL, it sends you their location. You will receive the following information:

      - Latitude

      - Longitude

      - Their full address

      - A URL to a Google map with the location marked

      # How to use it

      To use Geolocation, simply insert the placeholder `(Geolocation)` (including the parenthesis) into an SMS or Email message, and that's it. Our system will handle the placeholder and insert the correct information required to allow geolocation tracking via message.

      For more information, see our [help article](https://help.clicksend.com/geolocation/how-does-geolocation-work).

      Refer to [**Application Status Codes**](#introduction/application-status-codes) for the possible response message status strings.

      # How many characters can I send in a message?

      ## Standard MMS Message

      1500 characters

      ## Unicode MMS Message

      500 characters

      If a message is longer the allowed number of characters it will be truncated. If a message contains any characters that aren't in the GSM 03.38 character set, the message type will be treated as unicode. (`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_03.38`)

      # Maximum File Size

      You can send a single attachment with a size of up to 250 kB. Some older devices can only accept attachments with up to 30 kB.

      # How many messages can I send?

      ## Send SMS Endpoint

      You can post **up to 1000 messages** with each API call. You can send to a mix of contacts and contact lists, as long as the total number of recipients is up to 1000. The response contains a status and details for each recipient.

      Refer to [**Application Status Codes**](#introduction/application-status-codes) for the possible response message status strings.

      ## SMS Campaign Endpoint

      You can post to a list with **up to 20000 recipients** with each API call. You can only send to a single list containing up to 20,000 recipients. The response is far less detailed than the normal Send SMS endpoint.

      # How many characters can I send in a message?

      A standard SMS message has a maximum of 160 characters. Longer messages are definitely possible, however please be aware that exceeding 160 characters will constitute a ‘second’ message. The end user will see this as 1 long message on their handset.
      When a message is longer than 160 characters, this is referred to as a multi-part message as it contains multiple messages (or multiple-parts). The total SMS limit then becomes 153 characters per ‘part’ as the 7 characters are used up by invisible headers and footers which denote which part of the message is being sent (i.e. Part 1 of 2). For example:
      If a message is longer than 6 message parts, it will be truncated (see below). If a message contains any characters that aren't in the GSM 03.38 character set, the message type will be treated as unicode. (`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_03.38`)

      ## Standard English Characters:

      | Number of Characters | Message Credits |
      |---|---|
      | 1 - 160 | 1 |
      | 161 - 306 | 2 |

        The `detect-address` endpoint accepts either a letter in PDF format or an address string and attempts to convert it to a standard address format. Note that the PDF should be in standard address format, having the recipient's name and address listed at the top.

        The endpoint accepts two types of data:
        1. A PDF file in `base64` encoding. In this case, submit the `base64`-encoded PDF file contents in the `content` field of the request body.
        2. An address string. In this case, submit the address in a string using the `address` field of the request body.

        **Supported File Types**
        We support `pdf`, `docx` and `doc` files. Contact us to add support for any other file type. If you're using `docx` or `doc` files, you'll need to convert the file first using our uploads endpoint with the querystring parameter `convert=post` e.g. `POST /uploads?convert=post`. This will return a URL to the converted pdf file that can be used in the `/post/letters/send` endpoint.

        **Letter File Options**

        **Use existing URL**

        With this option, you can use an existing URL to a `pdf` document. For example, you might generate the `pdf` on your server.

        **Upload File to Our Server**

        With this option, you can use the `/uploads` endpoint to upload the document. The `/uploads` endpoint returns a URL that can be used in the `/post/letters/send` endpoint.

        **Supported File Types**
        We support PDF, docx and doc. Contact us to add support for any other file type. If you're using docx or doc files, you'll need to convert the file first using our uploads endpoint with the querystring parameter ?convert=post. e.g. POST /uploads?convert=post. This will return a URL to the converted pdf file that can be used in the /post/postcards/send endpoint.

        **Postcard File Options**

        **Use existing URL**

        With this option, you can use an existing URL to a PDF document. For example, you might generate the pdf on your server.

        For `file_urls` field. You can attach at least 1 and max of 2 PDF file urls.

        - Supply a single pdf with 2 pages (front and back)

        - Supply 2 urls to seperate PDFs

        **Upload File to Our Server**

        With this option, you can use the `/uploads` endpoint to upload the document. The `/uploads` endpoint returns a URL that can be used in the `/post/postcards/send` endpoint.
