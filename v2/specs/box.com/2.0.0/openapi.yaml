    get:
      description: |-
        Authorize a user by sending them through the [Box](https://box.com)
        website and request their permission to act on their behalf.

        This is the first step when authenticating a user using
        OAuth 2.0. To request a user's authorization to use the Box APIs
        on their behalf you will need to send a user to the URL with this
        format.
      operationId: get_authorize
      parameters:
        - description: The type of response we'd like to receive.
          example: code
          in: query
          name: response_type
          required: true
          schema:
            enum:
              - code
            format: token
            type: string
        - description: |-
            The Client ID of the application that is requesting to authenticate
            the user. To get the Client ID for your application, log in to your
            Box developer console and click the **Edit Application** link for
            the application you're working with. In the OAuth 2.0 Parameters section
            of the configuration page, find the item labelled `client_id`. The
            text of that item is your application's Client ID.
          example: ly1nj6n11vionaie65emwzk575hnnmrk
          in: query
          name: client_id
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
        - description: |-
            The URI to which Box redirects the browser after the user has granted
            or denied the application permission. This URI match one of the redirect
            URIs in the configuration of your application. It must be a
            valid HTTPS URI and it needs to be able to handle the redirection to
            complete the next step in the OAuth 2.0 flow.
            Although this parameter is optional, it must be a part of the
            authorization URL if you configured multiple redirect URIs
            for the application in the developer console. A missing parameter causes
            a `redirect_uri_missing` error after the user grants application access.
          example: http://example.com/auth/callback
          in: query
          name: redirect_uri
          required: false
          schema:
            format: url
            type: string
        - description: |-
            A custom string of your choice. Box will pass the same string to
            the redirect URL when authentication is complete. This parameter
            can be used to identify a user on redirect, as well as protect
            against hijacked sessions and other exploits.
          example: my_state
          in: query
          name: state
          required: false
          schema:
            type: string
        - description: |-
            A comma-separated list of application scopes you'd like to
            authenticate the user for. This defaults to all the scopes configured
            for the application in its configuration page.
          example: admin_readwrite
          in: query
          name: scope
          required: false
          schema:

                    will send them an email notification, letting them know
                    they have been mentioned.

                    The `user_id` is the target user's ID, where the `name`

        Returns up to a year of past events for a given user
        or for the entire enterprise.

        By default this returns events for the authenticated user. To retrieve events
        for the entire enterprise, set the `stream_type` to `admin_logs_streaming`
        for live monitoring of new events, or `admin_logs` for querying across
        historical events. The user making the API call will
        need to have admin privileges, and the application will need to have the
        scope `manage enterprise properties` checked.
      operationId: get_events
      parameters:
        - description: |-
            Defines the type of events that are returned

            * `all` returns everything for a user and is the default
            * `changes` returns events that may cause file tree changes
              such as file updates or collaborations.
            * `sync` is similar to `changes` but only applies to synced folders
            * `admin_logs` returns all events for an entire enterprise and
              requires the user making the API call to have admin permissions. This
              stream type is for programmatically pulling from a 1 year history of
              events across all users within the enterprise and within a
              `created_after` and `created_before` time frame. The complete history
              of events will be returned in chronological order based on the event
              time, but latency will be much higher than `admin_logs_streaming`.
            * `admin_logs_streaming` returns all events for an entire enterprise and
              requires the user making the API call to have admin permissions. This
              stream type is for polling for recent events across all users within
              the enterprise. Latency will be much lower than `admin_logs`, but
              events will not be returned in chronological order and may
              contain duplicates.
          example: all
          in: query
          name: stream_type
          schema:
            default: all
            enum:

            The location in the event stream to start receiving events from.

            * `now` will return an empty list events and
            the latest stream position for initialization.
            * `0` or `null` will return all events.

            Limits the number of events returned

            Note: Sometimes, the events less than the limit requested can be returned
            even when there may be more events remaining. This is primarily done in
            the case where a number of events have already been retrieved and these
            retrieved events are returned rather than delaying for an unknown amount
            of time to see if there are any more results.
          example: 50
          in: query
          name: limit
          schema:
            default: 100

        Returns a list of real-time servers that can be used for long-polling updates
        to the [event stream](#get-events).

        Long polling is the concept where a HTTP request is kept open until the
        server sends a response, then repeating the process over and over to receive
        updated responses.

        Long polling the event stream can only be used for user events, not for
        enterprise events.

        To use long polling, first use this endpoint to retrieve a list of long poll
        URLs. Next, make a long poll request to any of the provided URLs.

        When an event occurs in monitored account a response with the value
        `new_change` will be sent. The response contains no other details as
        it only serves as a prompt to take further action such as sending a
        request to the [events endpoint](#get-events) with the last known
        `stream_position`.

        After the server sends this response it closes the connection. You must now
        repeat the long poll process to begin listening for events again.

        If no events occur for a while and the connection times out you will
        receive a response with the value `reconnect`. When you receive this response
        you’ll make another call to this endpoint to restart the process.

        If you receive no events in `retry_timeout` seconds then you will need to
        make another request to the real-time server (one of the URLs in the response
        for this endpoint). This might be necessary due to network errors.

        Finally, if you receive a `max_retries` error when making a request to the
        real-time server, you should start over by making a call to this endpoint
        first.

        Due to ongoing re-architecture efforts this API might not return all file

        Instead, this API will only return file versions held in the legacy
        architecture. Two new endpoints will available to request any file versions
        held in the new architecture.

        For file versions held in the new architecture, the `GET
        /legal_hold_policy_assignments/:id/file_versions_on_hold` API can be used to
        return all past file versions available for this policy assignment, and the
        `GET /legal_hold_policy_assignments/:id/files_on_hold` API can be used to
        return any current (latest) versions of a file under legal hold.

        The `GET /legal_hold_policy_assignments?policy_id={id}` API can be used to
        find a list of policy assignments for a given policy ID.

        Once the re-architecture is completed this API will be deprecated.

        using the Chunk Upload APIs.

        # Request body order

        The `attributes` part of the body must come **before** the
        `file` part. Requests that do not follow this format when
        uploading the file will receive a HTTP `400` error with a
        `metadata_after_file_contents` error code.

      parameters:
        - description: |-
            A comma-separated list of attributes to include in the
            response. This can be used to request fields that are
            not normally returned in a standard response.

            Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the
            effect that none of the standard fields are returned in
            the response unless explicitly specified, instead only
            fields for the mini representation are returned, additional
            to the fields requested.
          example:
            - id

            Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the

            of a file. Use this in combination with the `fields` query
            parameter to request a specific file representation.

            The general format for these representations is
            `X-Rep-Hints: [...]` where `[...]` is one or many
            hints in the format `[fileType?query]`.

            For example, to request a `png` representation in `32x32`
            as well as `64x64` pixel dimensions provide the following
            hints.

            `x-rep-hints: [jpg?dimensions=32x32][jpg?dimensions=64x64]`

            Additionally, a `text` representation is available for all
            document file types in Box using the `[extracted_text]`
            representation.

      parameters:

            The unique identifier that represents a file.

            The ID for any file can be determined
            by visiting a file in the web application
            and copying the ID from the URL. For example,
            for the URL `https://*.app.box.com/files/123`
            the `file_id` is `123`.
          example: "12345"

            A comma-separated list of attributes to include in the
            response. This can be used to request fields that are
            not normally returned in a standard response.

            Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the
            effect that none of the standard fields are returned in
            the response unless explicitly specified, instead only
            fields for the mini representation are returned, additional
            to the fields requested.
          example:
            - id

            The unique identifier that represents a file.

            The ID for any file can be determined
            by visiting a file in the web application
            and copying the ID from the URL. For example,
            for the URL `https://*.app.box.com/files/123`
            the `file_id` is `123`.
          example: "12345"
          in: path
          name: file_id
          required: true

                    The settings for the shared link to create on the file.
                    Use an empty object (`{}`) to use the default settings for shared
                    links.
                  properties:
                    access:
                      description: |-
                        The level of access for the shared link. This can be
                        restricted to anyone with the link (`open`), only people
                        within the company (`company`) and only those who
                        have been invited to the file (`collaborators`).

                        If not set, this field defaults to the access level specified
                        by the enterprise admin. To create a shared link with this
                        default setting pass the `shared_link` object with
                        no `access` field, for example `{ "shared_link": {} }`.

                        The `company` access level is only available to paid
                        accounts.
                      enum:
                        - open
                        - company
                        - collaborators
                      example: open
                      type: string
                    password:
                      description: |-
                        The password required to access the shared link. Set the
                        password to `null` to remove it.

                        A password can only be set when `access` is set to `open`.
                      example: do-not-use-this-password
                      type: string
                    permissions:

                            This can only be set when `access` is set to
                            `open` or `company`.
                          example: true
                          type: boolean
                        can_edit:

                            If the shared link allows for editing of files.
                            This can only be set when `access` is set to
                            `open` or `company`.
                            This value can only be `true` is `can_download` is
                            also `true`.
                          example: true
                          type: boolean
                        can_preview:

                            If the shared link allows for previewing of files.
                            This value is always `true`. For shared links on folders
                            this also applies to any items in the folder.
                          example: true
                          type: boolean
                      type: object

                        current date and time.
                      example: 2012-12-12T10:53:43-08:00

                        for example `https://app.box.com/v/my-shared-link`.

                        Custom URLs should not be used when sharing sensitive content
                        as vanity URLs are a lot easier to guess than regular shared
                        links.

            The unique identifier that represents a file.

            The ID for any file can be determined
            by visiting a file in the web application
            and copying the ID from the URL. For example,
            for the URL `https://*.app.box.com/files/123`
            the `file_id` is `123`.
          example: "12345"
          in: path
          name: file_id
          required: true

                      description: |-
                        The level of access for the shared link. This can be
                        restricted to anyone with the link (`open`), only people
                        within the company (`company`) and only those who
                        have been invited to the folder (`collaborators`).

                        If not set, this field defaults to the access level specified
                        by the enterprise admin. To create a shared link with this
                        default setting pass the `shared_link` object with
                        no `access` field, for example `{ "shared_link": {} }`.

                        The `company` access level is only available to paid
                        accounts.
                      enum:
                        - open
                        - company
                        - collaborators
                      example: open
                      type: string
                    password:
                      description: |-
                        The password required to access the shared link. Set the
                        password to `null` to remove it.

                        A password can only be set when `access` is set to `open`.
                      example: do-not-use-this-password

                            This can only be set when `access` is set to
                            `open` or `company`.
                          example: true
                          type: boolean
                        can_edit:
                          description: |-
                            If the shared link allows for editing of files.
                            This can only be set when `access` is set to
                            `open` or `company`.
                            This value can only be `true` is `can_download` is
                            also `true`.
                          example: true
                          type: boolean
                        can_preview:
                          description: |-
                            If the shared link allows for previewing of files.
                            This value is always `true`. For shared links on folders
                            this also applies to any items in the folder.
                          example: true
                          type: boolean
                      type: object

                      description: |-
                        The timestamp at which this shared link will
                        expire. This field can only be set by
                        users with paid accounts. The value must be greater than the
                        current date and time.
                      example: 2012-12-12T10:53:43-08:00

                        Custom URLs should not be used when sharing sensitive content
                        as vanity URLs are a lot easier to guess than regular shared
                        links.

            The URL, and optional password, for the shared link of this item.

            This header can be used to access items that have not been

        The metadata instance can only be updated if the template has already been
        applied to the file before. When editing metadata, only values that match
        the metadata template schema will be accepted.

        The update is applied atomically. If any errors occur during the

        trash can it be retrieved with this API call. If instead one of
        its parent folders was moved to the trash, only that folder
        can be inspected using the
        [`GET /folders/:id/trash`](e://get_folders_id_trash) API.

        To list all items that have been moved to the trash, please
        use the [`GET /folders/trash/items`](e://get-folders-trash-items/)
        API.

            The ID for any file can be determined

        Any attribute in the full files or folders objects can be passed
        in with the `fields` parameter to retrieve those specific
        attributes that are not returned by default.

      parameters:
        - description: |-
            A comma-separated list of attributes to include in the
            response. This can be used to request fields that are
            not normally returned in a standard response.

            Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the
            effect that none of the standard fields are returned in
            the response unless explicitly specified, instead only
            fields for the mini representation are returned, additional
            to the fields requested.

            The offset of the item at which to begin the response.

            Queries with offset parameter value
            exceeding 10000 will be rejected

            Specifies whether to use marker-based pagination instead of
            offset-based pagination. Only one pagination method can
            be used at a time.

            By setting this value to true, the API will return a `marker` field
            that can be passed as a parameter to this endpoint to get the next
            page of the response.
          example: true

            Defines the position marker at which to begin returning results. This is
            used when paginating using marker-based pagination.

        - description: |-
            Defines the **second** attribute by which items

            Items are always sorted by their `type` first, with
            folders listed before files, and files listed
            before web links.

        During this operation, part of the file tree will be locked, mainly
        the source folder and all of its descendants, as well as the destination
        folder.

        For the duration of the operation, no other move, copy, delete, or restore
        operation can performed on any of the locked folders.

            The unique identifier that represent a folder.

            The ID for any folder can be determined
            by visiting this folder in the web application
            and copying the ID from the URL. For example,
            for the URL `https://*.app.box.com/folder/123`
            the `folder_id` is `123`.

            The root folder of a Box account is
            always represented by the ID `0`.

        Get a list of previous file versions for a legal hold
        assignment.

        In some cases you may only need the latest file versions instead. In these
        cases, use the `GET  /legal_hold_policy_assignments/:id/files_on_hold` API
        instead to return any current (latest) versions of a file for this legal hold
        policy assignment.

        Due to ongoing re-architecture efforts this API might not return all files
        held for this policy ID. Instead, this API will only return past file versions
        held in the newly developed architecture. The `GET /file_version_legal_holds`
        API can be used to fetch current and past versions of files held within the
        legacy architecture.

        The `GET /legal_hold_policy_assignments?policy_id={id}` API can be used to
        find a list of policy assignments for a given policy ID.

                    This value needs to be set to `enterprise`, as `global` scopes can
                    not be created by applications.

                    unique across the enterprise for which the metadata template is
                    being created.

                    When not provided, the API will create a unique `templateKey`
                    based on the value of the `displayName`.

        When an enterprise does not yet have any classifications, this API call
        initializes the classification template with an initial set of
        classifications.

        If an enterprise already has a classification, the template will already

        An Access Token is a string that enables Box to verify that a
        request belongs to an authorized session. In the normal order of
        operations you will begin by requesting authentication from the
        [authorize](#get-authorize) endpoint and Box will send you an
        authorization code.

        You will then send this code to this endpoint to exchange it for
        an Access Token. The returned Access Token can then be used to to make
        Box API calls.

        Searches for files, folders, web links, and shared files across the
        users content or across the entire enterprise.
      operationId: get_search
      parameters:
        - description: |-
            The string to search for. This query is matched against item names,
            descriptions, text content of files, and various other fields of
            the different item types.

            This parameter supports a variety of operators to further refine
            the results returns.

            * `""` - by wrapping a query in double quotes only exact matches are
              returned by the API. Exact searches do not return search matches
              based on specific character sequences. Instead, they return
              matches based on phrases, that is, word sequences. For example:
              A search for `"Blue-Box"` may return search results including
              the sequence `"blue.box"`, `"Blue Box"`, and `"Blue-Box"`;
              any item containing the words `Blue` and `Box` consecutively, in
              the order specified.
            * `AND` - returns items that contain both the search terms. For
              example, a search for `marketing AND BoxWorks` returns items
              that have both `marketing` and `BoxWorks` within its text in any order.
              It does not return a result that only has `BoxWorks` in its text.
            * `OR` - returns items that contain either of the search terms. For
              example, a search for `marketing OR BoxWorks` returns a result that
              has either `marketing` or `BoxWorks` within its text. Using this
              operator is not necessary as we implicitly interpret multi-word
              queries as `OR` unless another supported boolean term is used.
            * `NOT` - returns items that do not contain the search term provided.
              For example, a search for `marketing AND NOT BoxWorks` returns a result
              that has only `marketing` within its text. Results containing
              `BoxWorks` are omitted.

            Please note that we do not support lower case (that is,
            `and`, `or`, and `not`) or mixed case (that is, `And`, `Or`, and `Not`)
            operators.

            This field is required unless the `mdfilters` parameter is defined.
          example: sales
          in: query
          name: query
          required: false
          schema:
            type: string
        - description: |-
            Limits the search results to either the files that the user has
            access to, or to files available to the entire enterprise.

            The scope defaults to `user_content`, which limits the search
            results to content that is available to the currently authenticated
            user.

            The `enterprise_content` can be requested by an admin through our
            support channels. Once this scope has been enabled for a user, it
            will allow that use to query for content across the entire
            enterprise and not only the content that they have access to.
          example: user_content
          in: query
          name: scope
          required: false
          schema:
            default: user_content

            Limits the search results to any files that match any of the provided
            file extensions. This list is a comma-separated list of file extensions
            without the dots.
          example:
            - pdf
            - png
            - gif
          explode: false

            Limits the search results to any items created within
            a given date range.

            Date ranges are defined as comma separated RFC3339
            timestamps.

            If the the start date is omitted (`,2014-05-17T13:35:01-07:00`)
            anything created before the end date will be returned.

            If the end date is omitted (`2014-05-15T13:35:01-07:00,`) the
            current date will be used as the end date instead.
          example:

            current date will be used as the end date instead.
          example:

            Limits the search results to any items with a size within
            a given file size range. This applied to files and folders.

            Size ranges are defined as comma separated list of a lower
            and upper byte size limit (inclusive).

            The upper and lower bound can be omitted to create open ranges.
          example:
            - 1000000
            - 5000000
          explode: false

            Limits the search results to any items that are owned
            by the given list of owners, defined as a list of comma separated
            user IDs.

            Please note that the items still need to be owned or shared with
            the currently authenticated user for them to show up in the search
            results. If the user does not have access to any files owned by any of
            the users an empty result set will be returned.

            To search across an entire enterprise, we recommend using the
            `enterprise_content` scope parameter which can be requested with our
            support team.
          example:
            - "123422"
            - "23532"
            - "3241212"

            Limits the search results to any items that have been updated
            by the given list of users, defined as a list of comma separated
            user IDs.

            Please note that the items still need to be owned or shared with
            the currently authenticated user for them to show up in the search
            results. If the user does not have access to any files owned by any of
            the users an empty result set will be returned.

            This feature only searches back to the last 10 versions of an item.
          example:
            - "123422"
            - "23532"
            - "3241212"

            Limits the search results to items within the given
            list of folders, defined as a comma separated lists
            of folder IDs.

            Search results will also include items within any subfolders
            of those ancestor folders.

            Please note that the folders still need to be owned or shared with
            the currently authenticated user. If the folder is not accessible by this
            user, or it does not exist, a `HTTP 404` error code will be returned
            instead.

            To search across an entire enterprise, we recommend using the
            `enterprise_content` scope parameter which can be requested with our
            support team.
          example:
            - "4535234"
            - "234123235"
            - "2654345"

            Limits the search results to any items that match the search query
            for a specific part of the file, for example the file description.

            Content types are defined as a comma separated lists
            of Box recognized content types. The allowed content types are as follows.

            * `name` - The name of the item, as defined by its `name` field.
            * `description` - The description of the item, as defined by its
              `description` field.
            * `file_content` - The actual content of the file.
            * `comments` - The content of any of the comments on a file or
               folder.
            * `tags` - Any tags that are applied to an item, as defined by its
               `tags` field.
          example:
            - name
            - description
          explode: false
          in: query

            Limits the search results to any items of this type. This
            parameter only takes one value. By default the API returns
            items that match any of these types.

            * `file` - Limits the search results to files
            * `folder` - Limits the search results to folders
            * `web_link` - Limits the search results to web links, also known
               as bookmarks
          example: file
          in: query
          name: type

            Determines if the search should look in the trash for items.

            By default, this API only returns search results for items
            not currently in the trash (`non_trashed_only`).

            * `trashed_only` - Only searches for items currently in the trash
            * `non_trashed_only` - Only searches for items currently not in
              the trash
          example: non_trashed_only

            Limits the search results to any items for which the metadata matches
            the provided filter.

            This parameter contains a list of 1 metadata template to filter
            the search results by. This list can currently only
            contain one entry, though this might be expanded in the future.

            This parameter is required unless the `query` parameter is provided.
          example:
            - filters:

            Defines the order in which search results are returned. This API
            defaults to returning items by relevance unless this parameter is
            explicitly specified.

            * `relevance` (default) returns the results sorted by relevance to the
            query search term. The relevance is based on the occurrence of the search
            term in the items name, description, content, and additional properties.
            * `modified_at` returns the results ordered in descending order by date
            at which the item was last modified.
          example: modified_at
          in: query
          name: sort
          required: false
          schema:
            default: relevance

            type: string
        - description: |-
            Defines the direction in which search results are ordered. This API
            defaults to returning items in descending (`DESC`) order unless this
            parameter is explicitly specified.

            When results are sorted by `relevance` the ordering is locked to returning
            items in descending order of relevance, and this parameter is ignored.
          example: ASC

            Defines whether the search results should include any items
            that the user recently accessed through a shared link.

            Please note that when this parameter has been set to true,
            the format of the response of this API changes to return
            a list of [Search Results with
            Shared Links](r://search_results_with_shared_links)

            A comma-separated list of attributes to include in the
            response. This can be used to request fields that are
            not normally returned in a standard response.

            Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the
            effect that none of the standard fields are returned in
            the response unless explicitly specified, instead only
            fields for the mini representation are returned, additional
            to the fields requested.

        Returns the file represented by a shared link.

        A shared file can be represented by a shared link,
        which can originate within the current enterprise or within another.

        This endpoint allows an application to retrieve information about a
        shared file when only given a shared link.

        The `shared_link_permission_options` array field can be returned
        by requesting it in the `fields` query parameter.
      operationId: get_shared_items
      parameters:
        - description: |-
            Ensures an item is only returned if it has changed.

            Pass in the item's last observed `etag` value
            into this header and the endpoint will fail
            with a `304 Not Modified` if the item has not

            Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the
            effect that none of the standard fields are returned in
            the response unless explicitly specified, instead only

            By setting this value to true, the API will return a `marker` field
            that can be passed as a parameter to this endpoint to get the next
            page of the response.

        Move all of the items (files, folders and workflows) owned by a user into
        another user's account

        Only the root folder (`0`) can be transferred.

        Folders can only be moved across users by users with administrative
        permissions.

        All existing shared links and folder-level collaborations are transferred
        during the operation. Please note that while collaborations at the individual
        file-level are transferred during the operation, the collaborations are
        deleted when the original user is deleted.

        This call will be performed synchronously which might lead to a slow response
        when the source user has a large number of items in all of its folders.

        If the destination path has a metadata cascade policy attached to any of
        the parent folders, a metadata cascade operation will be kicked off
        asynchronously.

        There is currently no way to check for when this operation is finished.

        The destination folder's name will be in the format `{User}'s Files and
        Folders`, where `{User}` is the display name of the user.

        To make this API call your application will need to have the "Read and write
        all files and folders stored in Box" scope enabled.

        Please make sure the destination user has access to `Relay` or `Relay Lite`,
        and has access to the files and folders involved in the workflows being
        transferred.

        Admins will receive an email when the operation is completed.

                        no `access` field, for example `{ "shared_link": {} }`.

                        The `company` access level is only available to paid

                        no `access` field, for example `{ "shared_link": {} }`.

            A comma-separated list of attributes to include in the
            response. This can be used to request fields that are
            not normally returned in a standard response.

            Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the

                    and `templateKey`.

                    To access the metadata for a file or folder, first use the
                    metadata endpoints to determine the metadata templates available to your
                    enterprise.

                    Then use the `GET /files/:id` or `GET /folder/:id`
                    endpoint with the `fields` query parameter to get
                    the metadata by ID.

                    To request a metadata instance for a particular `scope` and `templateKey`
                    use the following format for the `fields` parameter:
                    `metadata.<scope>.<templateKey>`

                    For example, `?fields=metadata.enterprise_27335.marketingCollateral`.

                                  This URL is a template and will require the `{+asset_path}` to
                                  be replaced by a path. In general, for unpaged representations
                                  it can be replaced by an empty string.

                                  For paged representations, replace the `{+asset_path}` with the
                                  page to request plus the extension for the file, for example
                                  `1.pdf`.

                                  When requesting the download URL the following additional
                                  query params can be passed along.

                                  * `set_content_disposition_type` - Sets the
                                  `Content-Disposition` header in the API response with the
                                  specified disposition type of either `inline` or `attachment`.
                                  If not supplied, the `Content-Disposition` header is not
                                  included in the response.

                                  * `set_content_disposition_filename` - Allows the application to
                                    define the representation's file name used in the
                                    `Content-Disposition` header.  If not defined, the filename
                                    is derived from the source file name in Box combined with the
                                    extension of the representation.

                    would fetch an item via the API, and then listen to incoming
                    user events for changes to the item. The application would

                    is smaller than or equal to the `sequence_id` in the originally
                    fetched resource.

        specified folders, or an entire enterprise. A file version retention
        is a  record for a retained file version. To use this feature,
        you must  have the manage retention policies scope enabled for your
        API key via  your application management console. For more information
        about retention policies, please visit our help documentation

                    A list of metadata instances, nested within key-value pairs of their `scope`
                    and `templateKey`.

                    To access the metadata for a file or folder, first use the
                    metadata endpoints to determine the metadata templates available to your
                    enterprise.

                    Then use the `GET /files/:id` or `GET /folder/:id`
                    endpoint with the `fields` query parameter to get
                    the metadata by ID.

                    To request a metadata instance for a particular `scope` and `templateKey`
                    use the following format for the `fields` parameter:
                    `metadata.<scope>.<templateKey>`

                    For example, `?fields=metadata.enterprise_27335.marketingCollateral`.
                  example:
                    enterprise_27335:

                    template attached to each folder. Each metadata instance is nested

            By default, this endpoint returns only the most basic info about the items for

            This attribute takes a list of item fields, metadata template identifiers,
            or metadata template field identifiers.

            For example:

            * `created_by` will add the details of the user who created the item to
            the response.
            * `metadata.<scope>.<templateKey>` will return the mini-representation
            of the metadata instance identified by the `scope` and `templateKey`.
            * `metadata.<scope>.<templateKey>.<field>` will return all the mini-representation
            of the metadata instance identified by the `scope` and `templateKey` plus

        A retention policy blocks permanent deletion of content
        for a specified amount of time. Admins can create retention
        policies and then later assign them to specific folders, metadata
        templates, or their entire enterprise.  To use this feature, you must
        have the manage retention policies scope enabled
        for your API key via your application management console.

        Web link objects are treated similarly to file objects,
        they will also support most actions that apply to regular files.

                    A numeric identifier that represents the most recent user event
                    that has been applied to this item.

                    This can be used in combination with the `GET /events`-endpoint
                    to filter out user events that would have occurred before this
                    identifier was read.

                    An example would be where a Box Drive-like application
                    would fetch an item via the API, and then listen to incoming
                    user events for changes to the item. The application would
                    ignore any user events where the `sequence_id` in the event
                    is smaller than or equal to the `sequence_id` in the originally
                    fetched resource.

            To solve these conflicts, the API will automatically rename an item
            and return a mapping between the original item's name and its new
            name.

            For every conflict, both files will be renamed and therefore this list

            The URL that can be used to get the status of the `zip` archive being
            downloaded. A `Get` request to this URL will return the number of files
            in the archive as well as the number of items already downloaded or
            skipped. By default, this URL is only valid for a few seconds, until the
            `expires_at` time, unless a download is started after which the URL is
            valid for 12 hours from the start of the download.

            It is important to note that the domain and path of this URL might change
            between API calls, and therefore it's important to use this URL as-is.
