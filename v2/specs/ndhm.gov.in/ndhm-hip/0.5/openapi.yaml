    The following are the specifications for the APIs to be implemented at the Health Repository end if an entity is only serving the role of a HIP. The specs are essentially duplicates from the Gateway and Health Repository, but put together so as to make it clear to *HIPs* which set of APIs they should implement to participate in the network.

        Request for patient care context discover, made by Gateway intended for a specific HIP. It is expected that HIP will subsequently return either zero or one patient record with (potentially masked) associated care contexts
          1. **At least one of the verified identifier matches**
          2. **Name (fuzzy), gender matches**
          3. **If YoB was given, age band(+-2) matches**
          4. **If unverified identifiers were given, one of them matches**
          5. **If more than one patient records would be found after aforementioned steps, then patient who matches most verified and unverified identifiers would be returned.**
          6. **If there would be still more than one patients (after ranking) error would be returned**
          7. **Intended HIP should be able to resolve and identify results returned in the subsequent link confirmation request via the specified transactionId**
          8. **Intended HIP should store the discovery results with transactionId and care contexts discovered for subsequent link initiation**

        **NOTE**: This API is actually the callback URL that is passed as **dataPushUrl** in the data request API - /v0.5/health-information/hip/request. This API is directly called by HIP Data Bridge and is not mediated via CM, and hence not routed through the Gateway. 
          1. This API should be implemented at HIU side. It maybe implemented by the Data Bridge representing the HIU. 
          2. Entry elements maybe ***content*** or ***link***, although for version 1, entry ***content*** is preferred. 
          3. Entry ***content*** (or even link reference content) must be encrypted by means of Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange, utilizing the HIU keymaterials that are passed through the data request API - /v0.5/health-information/hip/request. 
          4. Media contains the mimetype of content, and for v1, it is "application/fhir+json"
          5. checksum is Md5 checksum of the data conent, before encryption
          6. Please refer to the NDHM Sandbox Documentation for the format of FHIR bundle that is passed through content

        This API is called by HIP/HIUs to confirm authentication of users. The transactionId returned by the previous callback API /users/auth/on-init must be sent. If Authentication is successful the callback API will send an "access token" for subsequent purpose specific API calls. Note only **credential.authCode** or **credential.demographic** should be sent
          1. demographic details are only required for  demographic auth as of now. 
          2. demographic details are required only in MEDIATED cases and if the **auth.mode** so demands. e.g. if **auth.mode** is DEMOGRAPHICS. Usually for demographic authentication, the name, gender and DOB must be exactly as specified in User Account.
          3. demographic.identifier is optional, however maybe required if authentication so mandates. 
          4. credential.authCode is required for other MEDIATED authentication like MOBILE_OTP, AADHAAR_OTP.

        This API is called by CM to confirm authentication of users. The transactionId returned is same as that passed in /auth/on-init. The "auth.status" conveys whether the request was GRANTED or DENIED.

          1. **auth.accessToken** - is specific to the purpose mentioned in the /auth/init. This token needs to be used for initiating the intended action. For example for HIP initiated linking of care-contexts
          2. **NOTE**, only one of **X-HIP-ID** or **X-HIU-ID** will be sent as part of header, not both.
          3. The payload is conditional to the purpose of auth. If purpose specified in /auth/init is KYC or KYC_AND_LINK, then patient details are passed. **auth.accessToken** is passed only if the purpose is LINK or KYC_AND_LINK.

      description: |
        If the patient's id is valid, CM will return a transactionId as initialization of user auth. If the request is valid, then 'auth.mode' will convey how the authentication should be done. The authentication can be *mediated* or *direct*. For mediated authentication modes, HIP or HIU is epected to send over relevant code (OTP/token) or demographic info via subsequent API call to /auth/confirm. for direct authentication case, CM will notify requester through/users/auth/notify API. 

          1. **auth.mode** conveys whats the mode of authentication is, and what is expected from HIP/HIU in the subsequent /auth/confirm API call. Possible values 
              1. MOBILE_OTP - auth via OTP to registered mobile. Mediated. 
              2. AADHAAR_OTP - auth initiated with Aadhaar with OTP. Mediated. 
              3. DEMOGRAPHICS - auth initiated with demographic verification
              4. DIRECT - for authentication directly with the patient. e.g. Mobile App, SMS. In this case, the HIP/HIU is not expected to call subsequent /auth/confirm call. CM will do direct authentication with the User (e.g. Mobile App, SMS etc) and will notify requester
          2. **meta.expiry** conveys the expiry time of the token and the authentication session
          3. **NOTE**, only one of **X-HIP-ID** or **X-HIU-ID** will be sent as part of header, not both.
