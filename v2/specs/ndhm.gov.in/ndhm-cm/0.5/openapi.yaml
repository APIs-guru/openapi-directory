        Result of patient care-context link request from HIP end. This happens in context of previous discovery of patient found at HIP end, therefore the link requests ought to be in reference to the patient reference and care-context references previously returned by the HIP. The correlation of discovery and link request is maintained through the transactionId. HIP should have
          1. **Validated transactionId in the request to check whether there was a discovery done previously, and the link request corresponds to returned patient care care context references**
          2. **Before returning the response, HIP should have sent an authentication request to the patient(eg: OTP verification)**

        This API is called by HIP/HIUs to confirm authentication of users. The transactionId returned by the previous callback API /users/auth/on-init must be sent. If Authentication is successful the callback API will send an "access token" for subsequent purpose specific API calls. Note only **credential.authCode** or **credential.demographic** should be sent
          1. demographic details are only required for  demographic auth as of now. 
          2. demographic details are required only in MEDIATED cases and if the **auth.mode** so demands. e.g. if **auth.mode** is DEMOGRAPHICS. Usually for demographic authentication, the name, gender and DOB must be exactly as specified in User Account.
          3. demographic.identifier is optional, however maybe required if authentication so mandates. 
          4. credential.authCode is required for other MEDIATED authentication like MOBILE_OTP, AADHAAR_OTP.
