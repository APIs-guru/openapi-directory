    Gateway is the hub that routes/orchestrates the interaction between consent managers and API bridges. There are 5 categories of APIs; discovery, link, consent flow, data flow and  monitoring. To reflect the consumers of APIs, the above apis are also categorized under cm facing, hiu facing and hip facing

        Request for patient care context discover, made by CM for a specific HIP. It is expected that HIP will subsequently return either zero or one patient record with (potentially masked) associated care contexts
          1. **At least one of the verified identifier matches**
          2. **Name (fuzzy), gender matches**
          3. **If YoB was given, age band(+-2) matches**
          4. **If unverified identifiers were given, one of them matches**
          5. **If more than one patient records would be found after aforementioned steps, then patient who matches most verified and unverified identifiers would be returned.**
          6. **If there would be still more than one patients (after ranking) error would be returned**
          7. **Intended HIP should be able to resolve and identify results returned in the subsequent link confirmation request via the specified transactionId**
          8. **Intended HIP should store the discovery results with transactionId and care contexts discovered for subsequent link initiation**

        Notification of consents to health information providers consent request granted, consent revoked, consent expired. Only the GRANTED, REVOKED and EXPIRED status notifications will be sent to HIP.
          1. If consent is granted, status=GRANTED, then consentDetail contains the consent artefact details and signature is available. 
          2. If consent is revoked, then status=REVOKED, and consentId specifes which consent artefact is revoked. 
          3. If the consent has expired, then status=EXPIRED, and consentId specifies which consent artefact has expired. Note, this is also responsibility of the HIP to keep track of consent expiry. Any data request on expired consent artefact must not be done.

        Result of patient care-context link request from HIP end. This happens in context of previous discovery of patient found at HIP end, therefore the link requests ought to be in reference to the patient reference and care-context references previously returned by the HIP. The correlation of discovery and link request is maintained through the transactionId. HIP should have
          1. **Validated transactionId in the request to check whether there was a discovery done previously, and the link request corresponds to returned patient care care context references**
          2. **Before returning the response, HIP should have sent an authentication request to the patient(eg: OTP verification)**
          3. **HIP should communicate the mode of authentication of a successful request**
          4. **HIP subsequently should expect the token passed via /link/confirm against the link.referenceNumber passed in this call**




















          
        The error section in the body, represents the potential errors that may have occurred. Possible reasons:
          1. **Patient reference number is invalid**
          2. **Care context reference numbers are invalid**

        This API is called by HIP/HIUs to confirm authentication of users. The transactionId returned by the previous callback API /users/auth/on-init must be sent. If Authentication is successful the callback API will send an "access token" for subsequent purpose specific API calls. Note only **credential.authCode** or **credential.demographic** should be sent
          1. demographic details are only required for  demographic auth as of now. 
          2. demographic details are required only in MEDIATED cases and if the **auth.mode** so demands. e.g. if **auth.mode** is DEMOGRAPHICS. Usually for demographic authentication, the name, gender and DOB must be exactly as specified in User Account.
          3. demographic.identifier is optional, however maybe required if authentication so mandates. 
          4. credential.authCode is required for other MEDIATED authentication like MOBILE_OTP, AADHAAR_OTP.

        This API is called by CM to confirm authentication of users. The transactionId returned is same as that passed in /auth/on-init. The "auth.status" conveys whether the request was GRANTED or DENIED.

          1. **auth.accessToken** - is specific to the purpose mentioned in the /auth/init. This token needs to be used for initiating the intended action. For example for HIP initiated linking of care-contexts
          2. **NOTE**, only one of **X-HIP-ID** or **X-HIU-ID** will be sent as part of header, not both.
          3. The payload is conditional to the purpose of auth. If purpose specified in /auth/init is KYC or KYC_AND_LINK, then patient details are passed. **auth.accessToken** is passed only if the purpose is LINK or KYC_AND_LINK.

        If the patient's id is valid, CM will return a transactionId as initialization of user auth. If the request is valid, then 'auth.mode' will convey how the authentication should be done. The authentication can be *mediated* or *direct*. For mediated authentication modes, HIP or HIU is epected to send over relevant code (OTP/token) or demographic info via subsequent API call to /auth/confirm. for direct authentication case, CM will notify requester through/users/auth/notify API. 

          1. **auth.mode** conveys whats the mode of authentication is, and what is expected from HIP/HIU in the subsequent /auth/confirm API call. Possible values 
              1. MOBILE_OTP - auth via OTP to registered mobile. Mediated. 
              2. AADHAAR_OTP - auth initiated with Aadhaar with OTP. Mediated. 
              3. DEMOGRAPHICS - auth initiated with demographic verification
              4. DIRECT - for authentication directly with the patient. e.g. Mobile App, SMS. In this case, the HIP/HIU is not expected to call subsequent /auth/confirm call. CM will do direct authentication with the User (e.g. Mobile App, SMS etc) and will notify requester
          2. **meta.expiry** conveys the expiry time of the token and the authentication session
          3. **NOTE**, only one of **X-HIP-ID** or **X-HIU-ID** will be sent as part of header, not both.
