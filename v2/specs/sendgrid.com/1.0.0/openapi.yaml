        **This endpoint allows you to remove one or more IP addresses from your list of allowed addresses.**

        To remove one or more IP addresses, pass this endpoint an array containing the ID(s) associated with the IP(s) you intend to remove. You can retrieve the IDs associated with your allowed IP addresses using the "Retrieve a list of currently allowed IPs" endpoint.

        It is possible to remove your own IP address, which will block access to your account. You will need to submit a [support ticket](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/support/) if this happens. For this reason, it is important to double check that you are removing only the IPs you intend to remove when using this endpoint.

        **This endpoint allows you to create a new API Key for the user.**

        To create your initial SendGrid API Key, you should [use the SendGrid App](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys). Once you have created a first key with scopes to manage additional API keys, you can use this API for all other key management.

        > There is a limit of 100 API Keys on your account.

        A JSON request body containing a `name` property is required when making requests to this endpoint. If the number of maximum keys, 100, is reached, a `403` status will be returned.

        Though the `name` field is required, it does not need to be unique. A unique API key ID will be generated for each key you create and returned in the response body.

        It is not necessary to pass a `scopes` field to the API when creating a key, but you should be aware that omitting the `scopes` field from your request will create a key with "Full Access" permissions by default.

        See the [API Key Permissions List](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/how-to-use-the-sendgrid-v3-api/api-authorization) for all available scopes. An API key's scopes can be updated after creation using the "Update API keys" endpoint.

        If a recipient uses the "one-click unsubscribe" option on an email associated with a deleted group, that recipient will be added to the global suppression list.

        Deleting a suppression group will remove the suppression, meaning email will once again be sent to the previously suppressed addresses. This should be avoided unless a recipient indicates they wish to receive email from you again. You can use our [bypass filters](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/index-suppressions/#bypass-suppressions) to deliver messages to otherwise suppressed addresses when exceptions are required.

        **This endpoint allows you to schedule a specific date and time for your campaign to be sent.**

        If you have the flexibility, it's better to schedule mail for off-peak times. Most emails are scheduled and sent at the top of the hour or half hour. Scheduling email to avoid those times (for example, scheduling at 10:53) can result in lower deferral rates because it won't be going through our servers at the same times as everyone else's mail.

        field_name:

        * Text fields must be url-encoded. Date fields are searchable only by unix timestamp (e.g. 2/2/2015 becomes 1422835200)
        * If field_name is a 'reserved' date field, such as created_at or updated_at, the system will internally convert
        your epoch time to a date range encompassing the entire day. For example, an epoch time of 1422835600 converts to
        Mon, 02 Feb 2015 00:06:40 GMT, but internally the system will search from Mon, 02 Feb 2015 00:00:00 GMT through

        **This endpoint allows you to create a new segment.**


          Valid operators for create and update depend on the type of the field for which you are searching.

        **Dates**
        - "eq", "ne", "lt" (before), "gt" (after)
            - You may use MM/DD/YYYY for day granularity or an epoch for second granularity.
        - "empty", "not_empty"
        - "is within"
            - You may use an [ISO 8601 date format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) or the # of days.

        **Text**
        - "contains"
        - "eq" (is/equals - matches the full field)
        - "ne" (is not/not equals - matches any field where the entire field is not the condition value)
        - "empty"
        - "not_empty"

        **Numbers**
        - "eq" (is/equals)
        - "lt" (is less than)
        - "gt" (is greater than)
        - "empty"
        - "not_empty"

        **Email Clicks and Opens**
        - "eq" (opened)
        - "ne" (not opened)

        All field values must be a string.


        Conditions using "eq" or "ne" for email clicks and opens should provide a "field" of either `clicks.campaign_identifier` or `opens.campaign_identifier`.
        The condition value should be a string containing the id of a completed campaign.


        The conditions list may contain multiple conditions, joined by an "and" or "or" in the "and_or" field.

        The first condition in the conditions list must have an empty "and_or", and subsequent conditions must all specify an "and_or".

        **This endpoint allows you to create a new design**.

        You can add a new design by passing data, including a string of HTML email content, to `/designs`. When creating designs from scratch, be aware of the styling constraints inherent to many email clients. For a list of best practices, see our guide to [Cross-Platform Email Design](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/cross-platform-html-design/).

        The Design Library can also convert your design’s HTML elements into drag and drop modules that are editable in the Designs Library user interface. For more, visit the [Design and Code Editor documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/editor/#drag--drop-markup).

        Because the `/designs` endpoint makes it easy to add designs, you can create a design with your preferred tooling or migrate designs you already own without relying on the Design Library UI.

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve a list of pre-built designs provided by Twilio SendGrid**.

        Unlike the `/designs` endpoint where *your* designs are stored, a GET request made to `designs/pre-builts` will retrieve a list of the pre-built Twilio SendGrid designs. This endpoint will not return the designs stored in your Design Library.

        By default, you will receive 100 results per request; however, you can modify the number of results returned by passing an integer to the `page_size` query parameter.

        This endpoint is useful for retrieving the IDs of Twilio SendGrid designs that you want to duplicate and modify.

        **This endpoint allows you to duplicate one of the pre-built Twilio SendGrid designs**.

        Like duplicating one of your existing designs, you are not required to pass any data in the body of a request to this endpoint. If you choose to leave the `name` field blank, your duplicate will be assigned the name of the design it was copied from with the text "Duplicate: " prepended to it. This name change is only a convenience, as the duplicate design will be assigned a unique ID that differentiates it from your other designs. You can retrieve the IDs for Twilio SendGrid pre-built designs using the "List SendGrid Pre-built Designs" endpoint.

        You can modify your duplicate’s name at the time of creation by passing an updated value to the `name` field when making the initial request.
        More on retrieving design IDs can be found above.

        **This endpoint allows you to edit a design**.

        The Design API supports PATCH requests, which allow you to make partial updates to a single design. Passing data to a specific field will update only the data stored in that field; all other fields will be unaltered.

        For example, updating a design's name requires that you make a PATCH request to this endpoint with data specified for the `name` field only.

        ```
        {
            "name": "<Updated Name>"
        }

        **This endpoint allows you to duplicate one of your existing designs**.

        Modifying an existing design is often the easiest way to create something new.

        You are not required to pass any data in the body of a request to this endpoint. If you choose to leave the `name` field blank, your duplicate will be assigned the name of the design it was copied from with the text "Duplicate: " prepended to it. This name change is only a convenience, as the duplicate will be assigned a unique ID that differentiates it from your other designs.

        You can modify your duplicate’s name at the time of creation by passing an updated value to the `name` field when making the initial request.
        More on retrieving design IDs can be found below.

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve a list of all assigned and unassigned IPs.**

        Response includes warm up status, pools, assigned subusers, and reverse DNS info. The start_date field corresponds to when warmup started for that IP.

        A single IP address or a range of IP addresses may be dedicated to an account in order to send email for multiple domains. The reputation of this IP is based on the aggregate performance of all the senders who use it.

        **This endpoint allows you to add an IP address to an IP pool.**

        You can add the same IP address to multiple pools. It may take up to 60 seconds for your IP address to be added to a pool after your request is made.

        Before you can add an IP to a pool, you need to activate it in your SendGrid account:

        1. Log into your SendGrid account.  
        1. Navigate to **Settings** and then select **IP Addresses**.  
        1. Find the IP address you want to activate and then click **Edit**.  
        1. Check **Allow my account to send mail using this IP address**.
        1. Click **Save**.

        You can retrieve all of your available IP addresses from the "Retrieve all IP addresses" endpoint.

        The Mail Send endpoint allows you to send email over SendGrid’s v3 Web API, the most recent version of our API. If you are looking for documentation about the v2 Mail Send endpoint, see our [v2 API Reference](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/mail.html).

        ## Helper Libraries

        Twilio SendGrid provides libraries to help you quickly and easily integrate with the v3 Web API in 7 different languages:

        * [C#](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-csharp) 
        * [Go](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-go)
        * [Java](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-java)
        * [Node JS](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs)
        * [PHP](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php)
        * [Python](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python)
        * [Ruby](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby)

        ## Dynamic Transactional Templates and Handlebars

        In order to send a dynamic template, specify the template ID with the `template_id` parameter. 

        To specify handlebar substitutions, define your substitutions in the request JSON with this syntax:

        ```
        "dynamic_template_data": {
              "guest": "Jane Doe",
              "partysize": "4",
              "english": true,
              "date": "April 1st, 2021"
            }
        ```

        For more information about Dynamic Transactional Templates and Handlebars, see our documentation and reference pages.

        * [How to send an email with Dynamic Transactional Templates
        ](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-transactional-templates/)
        * [Using Handlebars](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/using-handlebars/) 

        ## Mail Body Compression

        Mail body compression is available to some high volume accounts. Talk to your CSM if you are interested in this functionality. Mail body compression works by setting up a JSON payload as defined on this page, then compressing it with gzip (the gzip file can be no more than 30mb).

        To use mail body compression:

        1. Add a `Content-Encoding` header, with a value of `gzip`.  
           a. `Content-Encoding: gzip` 
        2. Send the gzip as a data-binary.  
           a. `--data-binary '@data.json.gz'
        `

        ## Multiple Reply-To Emails

        Using `reply_to_list` allows senders to include more than one recipient email address to receive reply and/or bounce messages from the recipient of the email.

        ### Usage Considerations

        * `reply_to` is mutually exclusive with `reply_to_list`. If both are used, then the API call will be rejected. 
        * The `reply_to_list` object, when used, must at least have an email parameter and may also contain a name parameter.
        * Each email address in the `reply_to_list` should be unique.
        * There is a limit of 1000 `reply_to_list` emails per mail/send request.
        * In SMTP calls, we will omit any invalid emails.

        ### Possible 400 Error Messages

        * `reply_to` is mutually exclusive with `reply_to_list`.
        * The `reply_to_list` object, when used, must at least have an email parameter and may also contain a name parameter.
        * Each email address in the `reply_to_list` should be unique.
        * There is a limit of X `reply_to` emails per mail/send request.
        * The `reply_to_list` email does not contain a valid address.
        * The `reply_to_list` email exceeds the maximum total length of X characters.
        * The `reply_to_list` email parameter is required.

        For example, if you own the domain `example.com`, and one or more of your recipients use `email@example.com` addresses, placing `example.com` in the address whitelist setting instructs Twilio SendGrid to ignore all bounces, blocks, and unsubscribes logged for that domain. In other words, all bounces, blocks, and unsubscribes will still be sent to `example.com` as if they were sent under normal sending conditions.

        **This endpoint allows you to update your current email address whitelist settings.**

        You can select whether or not this setting should be enabled by assigning the `enabled` field a `true` or `false` value.

        Passing only the `enabled` field to this endpoint will not alter your current `list` of whitelist entries. However, any modifications to your `list` of entries will overwrite the entire list. For this reason, you must included all existing entries you wish to retain in your `list` in addition to any new entries you intend to add. To remove one or more `list` entries, pass a `list` with only the entries you wish to retain.

        You should not add generic domains such as `gmail.com` or `yahoo.com`  in your `list` because your emails will not honor recipients' unsubscribes. This may cause a legal violation of [CAN-SPAM](https://sendgrid.com/docs/glossary/can-spam/) and could damage your sending reputation.

        The Address Whitelist setting allows you to specify email addresses or domains for which mail should never be suppressed.

        For example, if you own the domain `example.com`, and one or more of your recipients use `email@example.com` addresses, placing `example.com` in the address whitelist setting instructs Twilio SendGrid to ignore all bounces, blocks, and unsubscribes logged for that domain. In other words, all bounces, blocks, and unsubscribes will still be sent to `example.com` as if they were sent under normal sending conditions.

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve your current bounce and purge settings.**

        The Bounce Perge setting allows you to set a schedule that Twilio SendGrid will use to automatically delete contacts from your soft and hard bounce suppression lists.

        A hard bounce occurs when an email message has been returned to the sender because the recipient's address is invalid. A hard bounce might occur because the domain name doesn't exist or because the recipient is unknown.

        A soft bounce occurs when an email message reaches the recipient's mail server but is bounced back undelivered before it actually reaches the recipient. A soft bounce might occur because the recipient's inbox is full.

        You can also manage this setting in the [Mail Settings section of the Twilio SendGrid App](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/mail_settings). You can manage your bounces manually using the [Bounces API](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/bounces-api) or the [Bounces menu in the Twilio SendGrid App](https://app.sendgrid.com/suppressions/bounces).

        **This endpoint allows you to update your current Forward Spam mail settings.**

        Enabling the Forward Spam setting allows you to specify `email` addresses to which spam reports will be forwarded. You can set multiple addresses by passing this endpoint a comma separated list of emails in a single string.

        ```
        {
          "email": "address1@example.com, address2@exapmle.com",
          "enabled": true
        }
        ```

        The Forward Spam setting may also be used to receive emails sent to `abuse@` and `postmaster@` role addresses if you have authenticated your domain.

        For example, if you authenticated `example.com` as your root domain and set a custom return path of `sub` for that domain, you could turn on Forward Spam, and any emails sent to `abuse@sub.example.com` or `postmaster@sub.example.com` would be forwarded to the email address you entered in the `email` field.

        You can authenticate your domain using the "Authenticate a domain" endpoint or in the [Sender Authentication section of the Twilio SendGrid App](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth). You can also configure the Forward Spam mail settings in the [Mail Settings section of the Twilio SendGrid App](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/mail_settings).

        **This endpoint can be used to delete one or more contacts**.

        The query parameter `ids` must set to a comma-separated list of contact IDs for bulk contact deletion.

        The query parameter `delete_all_contacts` must be set to `"true"` to delete **all** contacts. 

        You must set either `ids` or `delete_all_contacts`.

        Deletion jobs are processed asynchronously.

        **This endpoint allows the [upsert](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/upsert) (insert or update) of up to 30,000 contacts, or 6MB of data, whichever is lower**. 

        Because the creation and update of contacts is an asynchronous process, the response will not contain immediate feedback on the processing of your upserted contacts. Rather, it will contain an HTTP 202 response indicating the contacts are queued for processing or an HTTP 4XX error containing validation errors. Should you wish to get the resulting contact's ID or confirm your contacts have been updated or added, you can use the "Get Contacts by Emails" endpoint. 

        Please note that custom fields need to have been already created if you wish to set their values for the contacts being upserted. To do this, please use the "Create Custom Field Definition" endpoint.

        You will see a `job_id` in the response to your request. This can be used to check the status of your upsert job. To do so, please use the "Import Contacts Status" endpoint.

        If the contact already exists in the system, any entries submitted via this endpoint will update the existing contact. The contact to update will be determined only by the `email` field and any fields omitted from the request will remain as they were. A contact's ID cannot be used to update the contact.

        The email field will be changed to all lower-case. If a contact is added with an email that exists but contains capital letters, the existing contact with the all lower-case email will be updated.

        **Use this endpoint to retrieve details of all current exported jobs**.

        It will return an array of objects, each of which records an export job in flight or recently completed. 

        Each object's `export_type` field will tell you which kind of export it is and its `status` field will indicate what stage of processing it has reached. Exports which are `ready` will be accompanied by a `urls` field which lists the URLs of the export's downloadable files — there will be more than one if you specified a maximum file size in your initial export request.

        Use this endpoint if you have exports in flight but do not know their IDs, which are required for the "Export Contacts Status" endpoint.

        **Use this endpoint to export lists or segments of contacts**.

        If you would just like to have a link to the exported list sent to your email set the `notifications.email` option to `true` in the `POST` payload.

        If you would like to download the list, take the `id` that is returned and use the "Export Contacts Status" endpoint to get the `urls`. Once you have the list of URLs, make a `GET` request to each URL provided to download your CSV file(s).

        You specify the segements and or/contact lists you wish to export by providing the relevant IDs in, respectively, the `segment_ids` and `list_ids` fields in the request body.

        The lists will be provided in either JSON or CSV files. To specify which of these you would required, set the request body `file_type` field to `json` or `csv`.

        You can also specify a maximum file size (in MB). If the export file is larger than this, it will be split into multiple files.

        **This endpoint allows a CSV upload containing up to one million contacts or 5GB of data, whichever is smaller.**

        Imports take place asynchronously: the endpoint returns a URL (`upload_uri`) and HTTP headers (`upload_headers`) which can subsequently be used to `PUT` a file of contacts to be  imported into our system.

        Uploaded CSV files may also be [gzip-compressed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip).

        In either case, you must include the field `file_type` with the value `csv` in your request body.

        The `field_mappings` paramter is a respective list of field definition IDs to map the uploaded CSV columns to. It allows you to use CSVs where one or more columns are skipped (`null`) or remapped to the contact field. 

        For example, if `field_mappings` is set to `[null, "w1", "_rf1"]`, this means skip column 0, map column 1 to the custom field with the ID `w1`, and map column 2 to the reserved field with the ID `_rf1`. See the "Get All Field Definitions" endpoint to fetch your custom and reserved field IDs to use with `field_mappings`.

        Once you recieve the response body you can then initiate a **second** API call where you use the supplied URL and HTTP header to upload your file. For example:

        `curl --upload-file "file/path.csv" "URL_GIVEN" -H 'HEADER_GIVEN'`

        If you'd like to monitor the status of your import job, use the `job_id` and the "Import Contacts Status" endpoint.

        Use the `job_id` from the "Import Contacts," "Add or Update a Contact," or "Delete Contacts" endpoints as the `id` in the path parameter.

        If there is an error with your `PUT` request, download the `errors_url` file and open it to view more details.

        The job `status` field indicates whether the job is `pending`, `completed`, `errored`, or `failed`. 

        Pending means not started. Completed means finished without any errors. Errored means finished with some errors. Failed means finshed with all errors, or the job was entirely unprocessable: for example, if you attempt to import file format we do not support.

        The `results` object will have fields depending on the job type.

        **Use this endpoint to locate contacts**.

        The request body's `query` field accepts valid [SGQL](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/segmentation-query-language/) for searching for a contact.

        Because contact emails are stored in lower case, using SGQL to search by email address requires the provided email address to be in lower case. The SGQL `lower()` function can be used for this.

        Only the first 50 contacts that meet the search criteria will be returned.

        If the query takes longer than 20 seconds, a `408 Request Timeout` status will be returned.

        Formatting the `created_at` and `updated_at` values as Unix timestamps is deprecated. Instead they are returned as ISO format as string.
        Twilio SendGrid recommends exporting your contacts regularly as a backup to avoid issues or lost data.

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve up to 100 contacts matching the searched `email` address(es), including any `alternate_emails`.** 

        Email addresses are unique to a contact, meaning this endpoint can treat an email address as a primary key to search by. The contact object associated with the address, whether it is their `email` or one of their `alternate_emails` will be returned if matched.

        Email addresses in the search request do not need to match the case in which they're stored, but the email addresses in the result will be all lower case. Empty strings are excluded from the search and will not be returned.

        This endpoint should be used in place of the "Search Contacts" endpoint when you can provide exact email addresses and do not need to include other [Segmentation Query Language (SGQL)](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/segmentation-query-language/) filters when searching.

        If you need to access a large percentage of your contacts, we recommend exporting your contacts with the "Export Contacts" endpoint and filtering the results client side.

        This endpoint returns a `200` status code when any contacts match the address(es) you supplied. When searching multiple addresses in a single request, it is possible that some addresses will match a contact while others will not. When a partially successful search like this is made, the matching contacts are returned in an object and an error message is returned for the email address(es) that are not found. 

        This endpoint returns a `404` status code when no contacts are found for the provided email address(es).

        A `400` status code is returned if any searched addresses are invalid.

        Twilio SendGrid recommends exporting your contacts regularly as a backup to avoid issues or lost data.

        **This endpoint creates a new custom field definition.**

        Custom field definitions are created with the given `name` and `field_type`. Although field names are stored in a case-sensitive manner, all field names must be case-insensitively unique. This means you may create a field named `CamelCase` or `camelcase`, but not both. Additionally, a Custom Field name cannot collide with any Reserved Field names. You should save the returned `id` value in order to update or delete the field at a later date. You can have up to 120 custom fields.

        The custom field name should be created using only alphanumeric characters (A-Z and 0-9) and underscores (\_). Custom fields can only begin with letters  A-Z or underscores (_). The field type can be date, text, or number fields. The field type is important for creating segments from your contact database.

        **Note: Creating a custom field that begins with a number will cause issues with sending in Marketing Campaigns.**

        **This endpoint allows you to duplicate an existing Single Send using its Single Send ID.**

        Duplicating a Single Send is useful when you want to create a Single Send but don't want to start from scratch. Once duplicated, you can update or edit the Single Send by making a PATCH request to the `/marketing/singlesends/{id}` endpoint.
         
        If you leave the `name` field blank, your duplicate will be assigned the name of the Single Send it was copied from with the text “Copy of ” prepended to it. The `name` field length is limited to 100 characters, so the end of the new Single Send name, including “Copy of ”, will be trimmed if the name exceeds this limit.

        This is **BETA** functionality. You may not have access, and we reserve the right to change functionality without notice.

        Filter all messages to search your Email Activity. All queries need to be [URL encoded](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/), and have this format:

        `query={query_type}="{query_content}"`

        encoded, this would look like this:

        `query=type%3D%22query_content%22`

        for example:

        Filter by a specific email - `query=to_email%3D%22example%40example.com%22`

        Filter by subject line - `query=subject%3d%22A%20Great%20Subject%22`

        This is BETA functionality. You may not have access, and we reserve the right to change functionality without notice.

        This request will kick off a backend process to generate a CSV file. Once generated, the worker will then send an email for the user download the file. The link will expire in 3 days.

        The CSV fill contain the last 1 million messages. This endpoint will be rate limited to 1 request every 12 hours (rate limit may change).

        This endpoint is similar to the GET Single Message endpoint - the only difference is that /download is added to indicate that this is a CSV download requests but the same query is used to determine what the CSV should contain.

        **This endpoint returns a list of all scopes that this user has access to.**

        API Keys are used to authenticate with [SendGrid's v3 API](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/how-to-use-the-sendgrid-v3-api/api-authorization).

        API Keys may be assigned certain permissions, or scopes, that limit which API endpoints they are able to access.

        This endpoint returns all the scopes assigned to the key you use to authenticate with it. To retrieve the scopes assigned to another key, you can pass an API key ID to the "Retrieve an existing API key" endpoint.

        For a more detailed explanation of how you can use API Key permissions, please visit our [API Keys documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys/).

        **This endpoint allows you to delete your spam reports.**

        Deleting a spam report will remove the suppression, meaning email will once again be sent to the previously suppressed address. This should be avoided unless a recipient indicates they wish to receive email from you again. You can use our [bypass filters](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/index-suppressions/#bypass-suppressions) to deliver messages to otherwise suppressed addresses when exceptions are required.

        There are two options for deleting spam reports: 

        1. You can delete all spam reports by setting the `delete_all` field to `true` in the request body.
        2. You can delete a list of select spam reports by specifying the email addresses in the `emails` array of the request body.

        **This endpoint allows you to invite a Teammate to your account via email.**

        You can set a Teammate's initial permissions using the `scopes` array in the request body. Teammate's will receive a minimum set of scopes from Twilio SendGrid that are necessary for the Teammate to function.

        **Note:** A teammate invite will expire after 7 days, but you may resend the invitation at any time to reset the expiration date.

        **This endpoint allows you to cancel or pause a scheduled send associated with a `batch_id`.**

        Passing this endpoint a `batch_id` and status will cancel or pause the scheduled send.

        Once a scheduled send is set to `pause` or `cancel` you must use the "Update a scheduled send" endpoint to change its status or the "Delete a cancellation or pause from a scheduled send" endpoint to remove the status. Passing a status change to a scheduled send that has already been paused or cancelled will result in a `400` level status code.

        If the maximum number of cancellations/pauses are added to a send, a `400` level status code will be returned.

        **This endpoint allows you to create a new inbound parse setting.**

        Creating an Inbound Parse setting requires two pieces of information: a `url` and a `hostname`.

        The `hostname` must correspond to a domain authenticated by Twilio SendGrid on your account. If you need to complete domain authentication, you can use the [Twilio SendGrid App](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth) or the "Authenticate a domain" endpoint. See "[How to Set Up Domain Authentication](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication/)" for instructions.

        Any email received by the `hostname` will be parsed when you complete this setup. You must also add a Twilio SendGrid MX record to this domain's DNS records. See "[Setting up the Inbound Parse Webhook](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/parsing-email/setting-up-the-inbound-parse-webhook/)" for full instructions.

        The `url` represents a location where the parsed message data will be delivered. Twilio SendGrid will make an HTTP POST request to this `url` with the message data. The `url` must be publicly reachable, and your application must return a `200` status code to signal that the message data has been received.

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve the statistics for your Parse Webhook useage.**

        SendGrid's Inbound Parse Webhook allows you to parse the contents and attachments of incomming emails. The Parse API can then POST the parsed emails to a URL that you specify. The Inbound Parse Webhook cannot parse messages greater than 30MB in size, including all attachments.

        There are a number of pre-made integrations for the SendGrid Parse Webhook which make processing events easy. You can find these integrations in the [Library Index](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Integrate/libraries.html#-Webhook-Libraries).

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve all the Sender Identities associated with an account.**

        This endpoint will return both verified and unverified senders.

        You can limit the number of results returned using the `limit`, `lastSeenID`, and `id` query string parameters.

        * `limit` allows you to specify an exact number of Sender Identities to return.
        * `lastSeenID` will return senders with an ID number occuring after the passed in ID. In other words, the `lastSeenID` provides a starting point from which SendGrid will iterate to find Sender Identities associated with your account.
        * `id` will return information about only the Sender Identity passed in the request.

        **This endpoint allows you to create a new Sender Identify**.

        Upon successful submission of a `POST` request to this endpoint, an identity will be created, and a verification email will be sent to the address assigned to the `from_email` field. You must complete the verification process using the sent email to fully verify the sender.

        If you need to resend the verification email, you can do so with the Resend Verified Sender Request, `/resend/{id}`, endpoint.

        If you need to authenticate a domain rather than a Single Sender, see the [Domain Authentication API](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/domain-authentication/authenticate-a-domain).

        **This endpoint returns a list of domains known to implement DMARC and categorizes them by failure type — hard failure or soft failure**.

        Domains listed as hard failures will not deliver mail when used as a [Sender Identity](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/sender-identity/) due to the domain's DMARC policy settings.

        For example, using a `yahoo.com` email address as a Sender Identity will likely result in the rejection of your mail. For more information about DMARC, see [Everything about DMARC](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/dmarc/).

        **This endpoint allows you to resend a verification email to a specified Sender Identity**.

        Passing the `id` assigned to a Sender Identity to this endpoint will resend a verification email to the `from_address` associated with the Sender Identity. This can be useful if someone loses their verification email or needs to have it resent for any other reason.

        You can retrieve the IDs associated with Sender Identities by passing a "Get All Verified Senders" endpoint.

        **This endpoint is used to share DNS records with a colleagues**

        Use this endpoint to send SendGrid-generated DNS record information to a co-worker so they can enter it into your DNS provider to validate your domain and link branding. 

        What type of records are sent will depend on whether you have chosen Automated Security or not. When using Automated Security, SendGrid provides you with three CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you are instead given TXT and MX records.

        If you pass a `link_id` to this endpoint, the generated email will supply the DNS records necessary to complete [Link Branding](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-link-branding/) setup. If you pass a `domain_id` to this endpoint, the generated email will supply the DNS records needed to complete [Domain Authentication](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication/). Passing both IDs will generate an email with the records needed to complete both setup steps.

        You can retrieve all your domain IDs from the returned `id` fields for each domain using the "List all authenticated domains" endpoint. You can retrieve all of your link IDs using the "Retrieve all branded links" endpoint.

        **This endpoint allows you to authenticate a domain.**

        If you are authenticating a domain for a subuser, you have two options:
        1. Use the "username" parameter. This allows you to authenticate a domain on behalf of your subuser. This means the subuser is able to see and modify the authenticated domain.
        2. Use the Association workflow (see Associate Domain section). This allows you to authenticate a domain created by the parent to a subuser. This means the subuser will default to the assigned domain, but will not be able to see or modify that authenticated domain. However, if the subuser authenticates their own domain it will overwrite the assigned domain.

        **This endpoint allows you to associate a specific authenticated domain with a subuser.**

        Authenticated domains can be associated with (i.e. assigned to) subusers from a parent account. This functionality allows subusers to send mail using their parent's domain authentication. To associate an authenticated domain with a subuser, the parent account must first authenticate and validate the domain. The parent may then associate the authenticated domain via the subuser management tools.

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve all of the Reverse DNS records created by this account.**

        You may include a search key by using the `ip` query string parameter. This enables you to perform a prefix search for a given IP segment (e.g., `?ip="192."`).

        Use the `limit` query string parameter to reduce the number of records returned. All records will be returned if you have fewer records than the specified limit.

        The `offset` query string parameter allows you to specify a non-zero index from which records will be returned. For example, if you have ten records, `?offset=5` will return the last five records (at indexes 5 through 9). The list starts at index zero.

        **This endpoint allows you to validate a reverse DNS record.**

        Always check the `valid` property of the response’s `validation_results.a_record` object. This field will indicate whether it was possible to validate the reverse DNS record. If the `validation_results.a_record.valid` is `false`, this indicates only that Twilio SendGrid could not determine the validity your reverse DNS record — it may still be valid.

        If validity couldn’t be determined, you can check the value of `validation_results.a_record.reason` to find out why.

        You can retrieve the IDs associated with all your reverse DNS records using the "Retrieve all reverse DNS records" endpoint.

        **This endpoint allows you to associate a branded link with a subuser account.**

        Link branding can be associated with subusers from the parent account. This functionality allows subusers to send mail using their parent's link branding. To associate link branding, the parent account must first create a branded link and validate it. The parent may then associate that branded link with a subuser via the API or the [Subuser Management page of the Twilio SendGrid App](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/subusers).
