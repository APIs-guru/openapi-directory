    The spoonacular Nutrition, Recipe, and Food API allows you to access over thousands of recipes, thousands of ingredients, 800,000 food products, over 100,000 menu items, and restaurants. Our food ontology and semantic recipe search engine makes it possible to search for recipes using natural language queries, such as "gluten free brownies without sugar" or "low fat vegan cupcakes." You can automatically calculate the nutritional information for any recipe, analyze recipe costs, visualize ingredient lists, find recipes for what's in your fridge, find recipes based on special diets, nutritional requirements, or favorite ingredients, classify recipes into types and cuisines, convert ingredient amounts, or even compute an entire meal plan. With our powerful API, you can create many kinds of food and especially nutrition apps.

    Special diets/dietary requirements currently available include: vegan, vegetarian, pescetarian, gluten free, grain free, dairy free, high protein, whole 30, low sodium, low carb, Paleo, ketogenic, FODMAP, and Primal.

                    pairingText: Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Steak. After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Sterling Vineyards Merlot with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 29 dollars per bottle.

                      pairingText: Chardonnay, Gruener Veltliner, and Sauvignon Blanc are great choices for Pasta. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Buddha Kat Winery Chardonnay with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 25 dollars per bottle.

                          description: We barrel ferment our Chardonnay and age it in a mix of Oak and Stainless. Giving this light bodied wine modest oak character, a delicate floral aroma, and a warming finish.

                      pairingText: Chardonnay, Gruener Veltliner, and Sauvignon Blanc are great choices for Pasta. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Buddha Kat Winery Chardonnay with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 25 dollars per bottle.

                        pairingText: Chardonnay, Gruener Veltliner, and Sauvignon Blanc are great choices for Pasta. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Buddha Kat Winery Chardonnay with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 25 dollars per bottle.

                            description: We barrel ferment our Chardonnay and age it in a mix of Oak and Stainless. Giving this light bodied wine modest oak character, a delicate floral aroma, and a warming finish.

                        pairingText: Chardonnay, Gruener Veltliner, and Sauvignon Blanc are great choices for Pasta. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Buddha Kat Winery Chardonnay with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 25 dollars per bottle.

                            description: We barrel ferment our Chardonnay and age it in a mix of Oak and Stainless. Giving this light bodied wine modest oak character, a delicate floral aroma, and a warming finish.

                        pairingText: Chardonnay, Gruener Veltliner, and Sauvignon Blanc are great choices for Pasta. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Buddha Kat Winery Chardonnay with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 25 dollars per bottle.

                          pairingText: Chardonnay, Gruener Veltliner, and Sauvignon Blanc are great choices for Pasta. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Buddha Kat Winery Chardonnay with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 25 dollars per bottle.

                          pairingText: Chardonnay, Gruener Veltliner, and Sauvignon Blanc are great choices for Pasta. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Buddha Kat Winery Chardonnay with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 25 dollars per bottle.

                      pairingText: Chardonnay, Gruener Veltliner, and Sauvignon Blanc are great choices for Pasta. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Buddha Kat Winery Chardonnay with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 25 dollars per bottle.

                      pairingText: Chardonnay, Gruener Veltliner, and Sauvignon Blanc are great choices for Pasta. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Buddha Kat Winery Chardonnay with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 25 dollars per bottle.
