    Portfolio Optimizer is a [Web API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API) to analyze and optimize investment portfolios (collection of financial assets such as stocks, bonds, ETFs, crypto-currencies) using modern portfolio theory algorithms (mean-variance, VaR, etc.).

    # API General Information

      Portfolio Optimizer is based on [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) for easy integration, uses [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) for the exchange of data and uses a standard [HTTP verb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods) (`POST`) to represent the action(s).

    Portfolio Optimizer is also as secured as a Web API could be: 
    * [256-bit HTTPS Encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS)
    * No usage of cookies
    * No usage of personal data  

    ## API Headers 
    The following HTTP header(s) are required when calling Portfolio Optimizer endpoints:
    * `Content-type: application/json`  
      This header specifies that the data provided in input to the endpoint is in JSON format

    The following HTTP header(s) are optional when calling Portfolio Optimizer endpoints:
    * `Content-Encoding: gzip`  
      This header indicates that the data provided in input to the endpoint is compressed with gzip.
    * `X-API-Key: <private API key>`  
      This header enables [authenticated users](#auth) to provide their private [API key](#overview--api-key) in order to [benefit from higher API limits](#overview--api-limits)

    ## API Key
    Portfolio Optimizer is free to use, but not free to run.

    In order to obtain an API key and benefit from [higher API limits](#overview--api-limits), a *small* participation to Portfolio Optimizer running costs is required.

    This participation takes the form of coffee(s), with one coffee = one month of usage.

    > **Notes:** 
    > * Please make sure not to expose your API key publicly!

    ## API Limits 

    Portfolio Optimizer comes with *fairly reasonable* API limits.

    For anonymous users:  
    * The API requests are restricted to a subset of all the available endpoints and/or endpoints features  
    * The API requests are limited to 1 request per second for all the anonymous users combined, with concurrent requests rejected 
    * The API requests are limited to 1 second of execution time
    * The API requests are limited to 20 assets, 250 portfolios, 500 series data points and 5 factors

    For authenticated users with an [API key](#overview--api-key):  
    * The API requests have access to all the available endpoints and endpoints features
    * The API requests are limited to 10000 requests per 24 hour per API key, with concurrent requests queued
    * The API requests are limited to 2.5 seconds of execution time
    * The API requests are limited to 100 assets, 1250 portfolios, 2500 series data points and 25 factors

    > **Notes:** 
    > * It is possible to further relax the API limits, or to disable the API limits alltogether; please [contact the support](https://portfoliooptimizer.io/contact/) for more details.
    > * Information on the API rate limits are provided in response messages HTTP headers `x-ratelimit-*`:  
    >   * `x-ratelimit-limit-second`, the limit on the number of API requests per second
    >   * `x-ratelimit-remaining-second`, the number of remaining API requests in the current second    
    >   * `x-ratelimit-limit-minute`, the limit on the number of API requests per minute
    >   * ...

    ## API Regions
    Portfolio Optimizer servers are located in Western Europe.

    > **Notes:** 
    > * It is possible to deploy Portfolio Optimizer in other geographical regions, for example to improve the API latency; please [contact the support](https://portfoliooptimizer.io/contact/) for more details. 

    ## API Response Codes       

    Standard [HTTP response codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) are used by Portfolio Optimizer to provide details on the status of API requests.

    | HTTP Code | Description | Notes |
    | --------- | ----------- | ----- |
    | 200 | Request successfully processed | - |
    | 400 | Request failed to be processed because of incorrect content | The response message body contains information on the incorrect content |
    | 401 | Request failed to be processed because of invalid API key | - |
    | 404 | Request failed to be processed because of non existing endpoint | The requested endpoint might exist, but needs to be accessed with another HTTP method (e.g., `POST` instead of `GET`) |
    | 429 | Request failed to be processed because of API limits violated | The response message HTTP headers `x-ratelimit-*` contain information on the [API limits](#overview--api-limits) |
    | 500 | Request failed to be processed because of an internal error | Something went wrong on Portfolio Optimizer side, do not hesitate to [report the issue](#overview--support) |
    | 502 | Request failed to be processed because of a temporary connectivity error | Something went wrong on Portfolio Optimizer side, please check the [API status](#overview--api-status) and do not hesitate to [report the issue](#overview--support) |

        Compute the distance between an asset correlation matrix and a reference correlation matrix, using one of the following distance metrics:
        * Euclidean distance (default), which is the distance induced by [the Frobenius norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm#Frobenius_norm)
        * Correlation matrix distance, defined in the first reference, which corresponds to [the cosine distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) between the two vectorized asset correlation matrices
        * Bures distance, defined in the second reference

        Compute the informativeness of an asset correlation matrix, using one of the following distance metrics:
        * Euclidean distance (default), which is the distance induced by [the Frobenius norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm#Frobenius_norm)
        * Correlation matrix distance, defined in the second reference, which corresponds to [the cosine distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) between the two vectorized asset correlation matrices
        * Bures distance, defined in the third reference

        Compute an asset correlation matrix as a convex linear combination of an asset correlation matrix and a target correlation matrix, the target correlation matrix being either:  
         * An equicorrelation matrix made of 1
         * An equicorrelation matrix made of 0
         * An equicorrelation matrix made of -1/(n-1), with n the number of assets
         * A provided correlation matrix

        Compute the backward-adjusted prices of one or several asset(s) for one or several date(s) from:
        * Unadjusted prices
        * Capital distributions, like stock dividends
        * Splits, like stock splits

        The adjustment base date is chosen to be the last date for which unadjusted prices are available, which implies that:
        * The price on the last date for which unadjusted prices are available is left unadjusted
        * The price on any other date is adjusted based on the capital distributions and the splits which occurred between this date and the last date for which unadjusted prices are available

        Compute the forward-adjusted prices of one or several asset(s) for one or several date(s) from:
        * Unadjusted prices
        * Capital distributions, like stock dividends
        * Splits, like stock splits

        The adjustment base date is chosen to be the first date for which unadjusted prices are available, which implies that:
        * The price on the first date for which unadjusted prices are available is left unadjusted
        * The price on any other date is adjusted based on the capital distributions and the splits which occurred between this date and the first date for which unadjusted prices are available

        * Minimum and maximum weights constraints
        * Maximum group weights constraints
        * Minimum and maximum portfolio exposure constraint

        > This endpoint is similar to the endpoint [`/portfolio/analysis/mean-variance/efficient-frontier`](#post-/portfolio/analysis/mean-variance/efficient-frontier), because the mean-variance efficient frontier is the "top" portion of the mean-variance minimum variance frontier.

        Compute an investable portfolio as close as possible, in terms of assets weights, to a desired portfolio, taking into account:
        * The desired assets weights
        * The desired assets groups weights
        * The desired maximum assets groups weights
        * The prices of the assets
        * The portfolio value
        * The requirement to purchase some assets by round lots or by odd lots
        * The possibility to purchase some assets by a fractional quantity of shares
        * The requirement to purchase a minimum number of shares, or a minimum monetary value, for some assets

        Compute the asset weights of the diversified maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio, as defined in the first reference, optionally subject to:  
        * Minimum and maximum weights constraints
        * Maximum group weights constraints
        * Minimum and maximum portfolio exposure constraints

        The diversification measure used in the optimization procedure is the [Herfindahl-Hirschman Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herfindahl%E2%80%93Hirschman_index) of the assets weights.

        Compute the asset weights of a diversified mean-variance efficient portfolio, as defined in the first reference, optionally subject to:  
        * Minimum and maximum weights constraints
        * Maximum group weights constraints
        * Minimum and maximum portfolio exposure constraints

        The diversification measure used in the optimization procedure is the [Herfindahl-Hirschman Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herfindahl%E2%80%93Hirschman_index) of the assets weights.

        > A diversified mean-variance efficient portfolio does NOT belong to [the mean-variance efficient frontier](#post-/portfolio/analysis/mean-variance/efficient-frontier), but is close to this frontier.

        Compute the asset weights of the diversified minimum variance portfolio, as defined in the first reference, optionally subject to:  
        * Minimum and maximum weights constraints
        * Maximum group weights constraints
        * Minimum and maximum portfolio exposure constraints

        The diversification measure used in the optimization procedure is the [Herfindahl-Hirschman Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herfindahl%E2%80%93Hirschman_index) of the assets weights.
