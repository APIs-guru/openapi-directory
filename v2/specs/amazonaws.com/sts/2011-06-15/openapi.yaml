      description: "<p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to access Amazon Web Services resources. These temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use <code>AssumeRole</code> within your account or for cross-account access. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRole</code> with other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html\">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison\">Comparing the Amazon Web Services STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRole</code> can be used to make API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the following exception: You cannot call the Amazon Web Services STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API operations.</p> <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">session policies</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policy Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>When you create a role, you create two policies: A role trust policy that specifies <i>who</i> can assume the role and a permissions policy that specifies <i>what</i> can be done with the role. You specify the trusted principal who is allowed to assume the role in the role trust policy.</p> <p>To assume a role from a different account, your Amazon Web Services account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account. </p> <p>A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that are delegated from the user account administrator. The administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code> for the ARN of the role in the other account.</p> <p>To allow a user to assume a role in the same account, you can do either of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Attach a policy to the user that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code> (as long as the role's trust policy trusts the account).</p> </li> <li> <p>Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can do either because the role’s trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy. When a resource-based policy grants access to a principal in the same account, no additional identity-based policy is required. For more information about trust policies and resource-based policies, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html\">IAM Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Tags</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These tags are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html\">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html\">Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist during role chaining. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining\">Chaining Roles with Session Tags</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Using MFA with AssumeRole</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when you call <code>AssumeRole</code>. This is useful for cross-account scenarios to ensure that the user that assumes the role has been authenticated with an Amazon Web Services MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example.</p> <p> <code>\"Condition\": {\"Bool\": {\"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\": true}}</code> </p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html\">Configuring MFA-Protected API Access</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i> guide.</p> <p>To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the <code>SerialNumber</code> and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters. The <code>SerialNumber</code> value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device. The <code>TokenCode</code> is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device produces. </p>"

      description: "<p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to access Amazon Web Services resources. These temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use <code>AssumeRole</code> within your account or for cross-account access. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRole</code> with other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html\">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison\">Comparing the Amazon Web Services STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRole</code> can be used to make API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the following exception: You cannot call the Amazon Web Services STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API operations.</p> <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">session policies</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policy Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>When you create a role, you create two policies: A role trust policy that specifies <i>who</i> can assume the role and a permissions policy that specifies <i>what</i> can be done with the role. You specify the trusted principal who is allowed to assume the role in the role trust policy.</p> <p>To assume a role from a different account, your Amazon Web Services account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account. </p> <p>A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that are delegated from the user account administrator. The administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code> for the ARN of the role in the other account.</p> <p>To allow a user to assume a role in the same account, you can do either of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Attach a policy to the user that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code> (as long as the role's trust policy trusts the account).</p> </li> <li> <p>Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can do either because the role’s trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy. When a resource-based policy grants access to a principal in the same account, no additional identity-based policy is required. For more information about trust policies and resource-based policies, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html\">IAM Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Tags</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These tags are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html\">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html\">Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can set the session tags as transitive.

For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining\">Chaining Roles with Session Tags</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Using MFA with AssumeRole</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when you call <code>AssumeRole</code>. This is useful for cross-account scenarios to ensure that the user that assumes the role has been authenticated with an Amazon Web Services MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example.</p> <p> <code>\"Condition\": {\"Bool\": {\"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\": true}}</code> </p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html\">Configuring MFA-Protected API Access</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i> guide.</p> <p>To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the <code>SerialNumber</code> and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters. The <code>SerialNumber</code> value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device. The <code>TokenCode</code> is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device produces. </p>"

      description: "<p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have been authenticated via a SAML authentication response. This operation provides a mechanism for tying an enterprise identity store or directory to role-based Amazon Web Services access without user-specific credentials or configuration. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html\">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison\">Comparing the Amazon Web Services STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The temporary security credentials returned by this operation consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications can use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to Amazon Web Services services.</p> <p> <b>Session Duration</b> </p> <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session. Your role session lasts for the duration that you specify, or until the time specified in the SAML authentication response's <code>SessionNotOnOrAfter</code> value, whichever is shorter. You can provide a <code>DurationSeconds</code> value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session\">View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. The maximum session duration limit applies when you use the <code>AssumeRole*</code> API operations or the <code>assume-role*</code> CLI commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html\">Using IAM Roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-role-chaining\">Role chaining</a> limits your CLI or Amazon Web Services API role session to a maximum of one hour. When you use the <code>AssumeRole</code> API operation to assume a role, you can specify the duration of your role session with the <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter. You can specify a parameter value of up to 43200 seconds (12 hours), depending on the maximum session duration setting for your role. However, if you assume a role using role chaining and provide a <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter value greater than one hour, the operation fails.</p> </note> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> can be used to make API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the following exception: you cannot call the STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API operations.</p> <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">session policies</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policy Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> does not require the use of Amazon Web Services security credentials. The identity of the caller is validated by using keys in the metadata document that is uploaded for the SAML provider entity for your identity provider. </p> <important> <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> can result in an entry in your CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the value in the <code>NameID</code> element of the SAML assertion. We recommend that you use a <code>NameIDType</code> that is not associated with any personally identifiable information (PII). For example, you could instead use the persistent identifier (<code>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent</code>).</p> </important> <p> <b>Tags</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can configure your IdP to pass attributes into your SAML assertion as session tags. Each session tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about session tags, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html\">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can pass up to 50 session tags.

For these and additional limits, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-limits.html#reference_iam-limits-entity-length\">IAM and STS Character Limits</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed inline session policy, managed policy ARNs, and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the other requirements. The <code>PackedPolicySize</code> response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit.</p> </note> <p>You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is attached to the role. When you do, session tags override the role's tags with the same key.</p> <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html\">Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can set the session tags as transitive.

Additionally, you must use Identity and Access Management (IAM) to create a SAML provider entity in your Amazon Web Services account that represents your identity provider. You must also create an IAM role that specifies this SAML provider in its trust policy. </p> <p>For more information, see the following resources:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml.html\">About SAML 2.0-based Federation</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_saml.html\">Creating SAML Identity Providers</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_saml_relying-party.html\">Configuring a Relying Party and Claims</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_saml.html\">Creating a Role for SAML 2.0 Federation</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> </li> </ul>"

Example providers include the OAuth 2.0 providers Login with Amazon and Facebook, or any OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider such as Google or <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html\">Amazon Cognito federated identities</a>.</p> <note> <p>For mobile applications, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito. You can use Amazon Cognito with the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforios/\">Amazon Web Services SDK for iOS Developer Guide</a> and the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforandroid/\">Amazon Web Services SDK for Android Developer Guide</a> to uniquely identify a user. You can also supply the user with a consistent identity throughout the lifetime of an application.</p> <p>To learn more about Amazon Cognito, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e840\">Amazon Cognito Overview</a> in <i>Amazon Web Services SDK for Android Developer Guide</i> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e664\">Amazon Cognito Overview</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services SDK for iOS Developer Guide</i>.</p> </note> <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> does not require the use of Amazon Web Services security credentials. Therefore, you can distribute an application (for example, on mobile devices) that requests temporary security credentials without including long-term Amazon Web Services credentials in the application. You also don't need to deploy server-based proxy services that use long-term Amazon Web Services credentials. Instead, the identity of the caller is validated by using a token from the web identity provider. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html\">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison\">Comparing the Amazon Web Services STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications can use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to Amazon Web Services service API operations.</p> <p> <b>Session Duration</b> </p> <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session\">View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. The maximum session duration limit applies when you use the <code>AssumeRole*</code> API operations or the <code>assume-role*</code> CLI commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html\">Using IAM Roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can be used to make API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the following exception: you cannot call the STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API operations.</p> <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">session policies</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policy Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Tags</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can configure your IdP to pass attributes into your web identity token as session tags. Each session tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about session tags, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html\">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plaintext session tag keys can’t exceed 128 characters and the values can’t exceed 256 characters.

Your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the other requirements. The <code>PackedPolicySize</code> response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit.</p> </note> <p>You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is attached to the role. When you do, the session tag overrides the role tag with the same key.</p> <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html\">Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist during role chaining. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining\">Chaining Roles with Session Tags</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Identities</b> </p> <p>Before your application can call <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>, you must have an identity token from a supported identity provider and create a role that the application can assume. The role that your application assumes must trust the identity provider that is associated with the identity token. In other words, the identity provider must be specified in the role's trust policy. </p> <important> <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can result in an entry in your CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the <a href=\"http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims\">Subject</a> of the provided web identity token. We recommend that you avoid using any personally identifiable information (PII) in this field. For example, you could instead use a GUID or a pairwise identifier, as <a href=\"http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SubjectIDTypes\">suggested in the OIDC specification</a>.</p> </important> <p>For more information about how to use web identity federation and the <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> API, see the following resources: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_oidc_manual.html\">Using Web Identity Federation API Operations for Mobile Apps</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity\">Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider</a>. </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/the-aws-web-identity-federation-playground/\"> Web Identity Federation Playground</a>.

Instead, we recommend that you create an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy application. Then attach a policy to the IAM user that limits federated users to only the actions and resources that they need to access. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html\">IAM Best Practices</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p> <b>Session duration</b> </p> <p>The temporary credentials are valid for the specified duration, from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours). The default session duration is 43,200 seconds (12 hours).

You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policy Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters.</p> <p>Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a policy, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions. When you pass session policies, the session permissions are the intersection of the IAM user policies and the session policies that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the IAM user. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.

If that policy specifically references the federated user session in the <code>Principal</code> element of the policy, the session has the permissions allowed by the policy. These permissions are granted in addition to the permissions granted by the session policies.</p> <p> <b>Tags</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html\">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider.

Assume that the user that you are federating has the <code>Department</code>=<code>Marketing</code> tag and you pass the <code>department</code>=<code>engineering</code> session tag. <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed in the request takes precedence over the user tag.</p>"

For a comparison of <code>GetFederationToken</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html\">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison\">Comparing the Amazon Web Services STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider. In this case, we recommend that you use <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/\">Amazon Cognito</a> or <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity\">Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> </note> <p>You can also call <code>GetFederationToken</code> using the security credentials of an Amazon Web Services account root user, but we do not recommend it. Instead, we recommend that you create an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy application. Then attach a policy to the IAM user that limits federated users to only the actions and resources that they need to access. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html\">IAM Best Practices</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p> <b>Session duration</b> </p> <p>The temporary credentials are valid for the specified duration, from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours). The default session duration is 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary credentials obtained by using the Amazon Web Services account root user credentials have a maximum duration of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).</p> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>You can use the temporary credentials created by <code>GetFederationToken</code> in any Amazon Web Services service with the following exceptions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You cannot call any IAM operations using the CLI or the Amazon Web Services API. This limitation does not apply to console sessions.</p> </li> <li> <p>You cannot call any STS operations except <code>GetCallerIdentity</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can use temporary credentials for single sign-on (SSO) to the console.</p> <p>You must pass an inline or managed <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">session policy</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policy Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters.</p> <p>Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a policy, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions. When you pass session policies, the session permissions are the intersection of the IAM user policies and the session policies that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the IAM user. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. For information about using <code>GetFederationToken</code> to create temporary security credentials, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_getfederationtoken\">GetFederationToken—Federation Through a Custom Identity Broker</a>. </p> <p>You can use the credentials to access a resource that has a resource-based policy. If that policy specifically references the federated user session in the <code>Principal</code> element of the policy, the session has the permissions allowed by the policy. These permissions are granted in addition to the permissions granted by the session policies.</p> <p> <b>Tags</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html\">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider. In this case, we recommend that you use <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/\">Amazon Cognito</a> or <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity\">Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> </note> <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html\">Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This means that you cannot have separate <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> tag keys. Assume that the user that you are federating has the <code>Department</code>=<code>Marketing</code> tag and you pass the <code>department</code>=<code>engineering</code> session tag. <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed in the request takes precedence over the user tag.</p>"

For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your operation fails.

The request to the federation endpoint for a console sign-in token takes a <code>SessionDuration</code> parameter that specifies the maximum length of the console session.
