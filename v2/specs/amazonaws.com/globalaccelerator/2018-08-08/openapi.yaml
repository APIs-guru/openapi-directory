  title: AWS Global Accelerator
  description: '<fullname>Global Accelerator</fullname> <p>This is the <i>Global Accelerator API Reference</i>. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about Global Accelerator API actions, data types, and errors. For more information about Global Accelerator features, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/what-is-global-accelerator.html">Global Accelerator Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p>Global Accelerator is a service in which you create <i>accelerators</i> to improve the performance of your applications for local and global users. Depending on the type of accelerator you choose, you can gain additional benefits. </p> <ul> <li> <p>By using a standard accelerator, you can improve availability of your internet applications that are used by a global audience. With a standard accelerator, Global Accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the Amazon Web Services global network. </p> </li> <li> <p>For other scenarios, you might choose a custom routing accelerator. With a custom routing accelerator, you can use application logic to directly map one or more users to a specific endpoint among many endpoints.</p> </li> </ul> <important> <p>Global Accelerator is a global service that supports endpoints in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions but you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region to create, update, or otherwise work with accelerators. That is, for example, specify <code>--region us-west-2</code> on AWS CLI commands.</p> </important> <p>By default, Global Accelerator provides you with static IP addresses that you associate with your accelerator. The static IP addresses are anycast from the Amazon Web Services edge network. For IPv4, Global Accelerator provides two static IPv4 addresses. For dual-stack, Global Accelerator provides a total of four addresses: two static IPv4 addresses and two static IPv6 addresses. With a standard accelerator for IPv4, instead of using the addresses that Global Accelerator provides, you can configure these entry points to be IPv4 addresses from your own IP address ranges that you bring toGlobal Accelerator (BYOIP). </p> <p>For a standard accelerator, they distribute incoming application traffic across multiple endpoint resources in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions , which increases the availability of your applications. Endpoints for standard accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses that are located in one Amazon Web Services Region or multiple Amazon Web Services Regions. For custom routing accelerators, you map traffic that arrives to the static IP addresses to specific Amazon EC2 servers in endpoints that are virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets.</p> <important> <p>The static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you <i>delete</i> an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic by using them. You can use IAM policies like tag-based permissions with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/access-control-manage-access-tag-policies.html">Tag-based policies</a>.</p> </important> <p>For standard accelerators, Global Accelerator uses the Amazon Web Services global network to route traffic to the optimal regional endpoint based on health, client location, and policies that you configure. The service reacts instantly to changes in health or configuration to ensure that internet traffic from clients is always directed to healthy endpoints.</p> <p>For more information about understanding and using Global Accelerator, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/what-is-global-accelerator.html">Global Accelerator Developer Guide</a>.</p>'

      description: <p>Add endpoints to an endpoint group. The <code>AddEndpoints</code> API operation is the recommended option for adding endpoints. The alternative options are to add endpoints when you create an endpoint group (with the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/api/API_CreateEndpointGroup.html">CreateEndpointGroup</a> API) or when you update an endpoint group (with the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/api/API_UpdateEndpointGroup.html">UpdateEndpointGroup</a> API). </p> <p>There are two advantages to using <code>AddEndpoints</code> to add endpoints:</p> <ul> <li> <p>It's faster, because Global Accelerator only has to resolve the new endpoints that you're adding.</p> </li> <li> <p>It's more convenient, because you don't need to specify all of the current endpoints that are already in the endpoint group in addition to the new endpoints that you want to add.</p> </li> </ul>

      description: <p>Delete an accelerator. Before you can delete an accelerator, you must disable it and remove all dependent resources (listeners and endpoint groups). To disable the accelerator, update the accelerator to set <code>Enabled</code> to false.</p> <important> <p>When you create an accelerator, by default, Global Accelerator provides you with a set of two static IP addresses. Alternatively, you can bring your own IP address ranges to Global Accelerator and assign IP addresses from those ranges. </p> <p>The IP addresses are assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you <i>delete</i> an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to the accelerator, so you can no longer route traffic by using them. As a best practice, ensure that you have permissions in place to avoid inadvertently deleting accelerators. You can use IAM policies with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator.

      description: <p>Delete a custom routing accelerator. Before you can delete an accelerator, you must disable it and remove all dependent resources (listeners and endpoint groups). To disable the accelerator, update the accelerator to set <code>Enabled</code> to false.</p> <important> <p>When you create a custom routing accelerator, by default, Global Accelerator provides you with a set of two static IP addresses. </p> <p>The IP addresses are assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you <i>delete</i> an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to the accelerator, so you can no longer route traffic by using them. As a best practice, ensure that you have permissions in place to avoid inadvertently deleting accelerators. You can use IAM policies with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator.

For each subnet endpoint that you add, Global Accelerator creates a new static port mapping for the accelerator. The port mappings don't change after Global Accelerator generates them, so you can retrieve and cache the full mapping on your servers. </p> <p>If you remove a subnet from your accelerator, Global Accelerator removes (reclaims) the port mappings. If you add a subnet to your accelerator, Global Accelerator creates new port mappings (the existing ones don't change). If you add or remove EC2 instances in your subnet, the port mappings don't change, because the mappings are created when you add the subnet to Global Accelerator.</p> <p>The mappings also include a flag for each destination denoting which destination IP addresses and ports are allowed or denied traffic.</p>

      description: <p>Remove endpoints from an endpoint group. </p> <p>The <code>RemoveEndpoints</code> API operation is the recommended option for removing endpoints. The alternative is to remove endpoints by updating an endpoint group by using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/api/API_UpdateEndpointGroup.html">UpdateEndpointGroup</a> API operation. There are two advantages to using <code>AddEndpoints</code> to remove endpoints instead:</p> <ul> <li> <p>It's more convenient, because you only need to specify the endpoints that you want to remove. With the <code>UpdateEndpointGroup</code> API operation, you must specify all of the endpoints in the endpoint group except the ones that you want to remove from the group.</p> </li> <li> <p>It's faster, because Global Accelerator doesn't need to resolve any endpoints. With the <code>UpdateEndpointGroup</code> API operation, Global Accelerator must resolve all of the endpoints that remain in the group.</p> </li> </ul>

Client affinity gives you control over whether to always route each client to the same specific endpoint.</p> <p>Global Accelerator uses a consistent-flow hashing algorithm to choose the optimal endpoint for a connection. If client affinity is <code>NONE</code>, Global Accelerator uses the "five-tuple" (5-tuple) properties—source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port, and protocol—to select the hash value, and then chooses the best endpoint. However, with this setting, if someone uses different ports to connect to Global Accelerator, their connections might not be always routed to the same endpoint because the hash value changes. </p> <p>If you want a given client to always be routed to the same endpoint, set client affinity to <code>SOURCE_IP</code> instead. When you use the <code>SOURCE_IP</code> setting, Global Accelerator uses the "two-tuple" (2-tuple) properties— source (client) IP address and destination IP address—to select the hash value.</p> <p>The default value is <code>NONE</code>.</p>
