  title: AWS Key Management Service
  description: <fullname>Key Management Service</fullname> <p>Key Management Service (KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide describes the KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about KMS, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/"> <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i> </a>.</p> <note> <p>KMS has replaced the term <i>customer master key (CMK)</i> with <i>KMS key</i> and <i>KMS key</i>. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, KMS is keeping some variations of this term.</p> <p>Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to KMS and other Amazon Web Services services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p> </note> <p>We recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to make programmatic API calls to KMS.</p> <p>If you need to use FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules when communicating with Amazon Web Services, use the FIPS endpoint in your preferred Amazon Web Services Region. For more information about the available FIPS endpoints, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/kms.html#kms_region">Service endpoints</a> in the Key Management Service topic of the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> <p>All KMS API calls must be signed and be transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). KMS recommends you always use the latest supported TLS version. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.</p> <p> <b>Signing Requests</b> </p> <p>Requests must be signed using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not use your Amazon Web Services account root access key ID and secret access key for everyday work. You can use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user or you can use the Security Token Service (STS) to generate temporary security credentials and use those to sign requests. </p> <p>All KMS requests must be signed with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4</a>.</p> <p> <b>Logging API Requests</b> </p> <p>KMS supports CloudTrail, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and related events for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/">CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>Additional Resources</b> </p> <p>For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html">Amazon Web Services Security Credentials</a> - This topic provides general information about the types of credentials used to access Amazon Web Services.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html">Temporary Security Credentials</a> - This section of the <i>IAM User Guide</i> describes how to create and use temporary security credentials.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4 Signing Process</a> - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing a request using an access key ID and a secret access key.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Commonly Used API Operations</b> </p> <p>Of the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful for most applications. You will likely perform operations other than these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the console.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>Encrypt</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>Decrypt</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GenerateDataKey</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext</a> </p> </li> </ul>

      description: '<p>Connects or reconnects a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html">custom key store</a> to its backing key store. For an CloudHSM key store, <code>ConnectCustomKeyStore</code> connects the key store to its associated CloudHSM cluster. For an external key store, <code>ConnectCustomKeyStore</code> connects the key store to the external key store proxy that communicates with your external key manager.</p> <p>The custom key store must be connected before you can create KMS keys in the key store or use the KMS keys it contains. You can disconnect and reconnect a custom key store at any time.</p> <p>The connection process for a custom key store can take an extended amount of time to complete. This operation starts the connection process, but it does not wait for it to complete. When it succeeds, this operation quickly returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no properties. However, this response does not indicate that the custom key store is connected. To get the connection state of the custom key store, use the <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> operation.</p> <p> This operation is part of the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html">custom key stores</a> feature in KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with the isolation and control of a key store that you own and manage.</p> <p>The <code>ConnectCustomKeyStore</code> operation might fail for various reasons. To find the reason, use the <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> operation and see the <code>ConnectionErrorCode</code> in the response. For help interpreting the <code>ConnectionErrorCode</code>, see <a>CustomKeyStoresListEntry</a>.</p> <p>To fix the failure, use the <a>DisconnectCustomKeyStore</a> operation to disconnect the custom key store, correct the error, use the <a>UpdateCustomKeyStore</a> operation if necessary, and then use <code>ConnectCustomKeyStore</code> again.</p> <p> <b>CloudHSM key store</b> </p> <p>During the connection process for an CloudHSM key store, KMS finds the CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store, creates the connection infrastructure, connects to the cluster, logs into the CloudHSM client as the <code>kmsuser</code> CU, and rotates its password.</p> <p>To connect an CloudHSM key store, its associated CloudHSM cluster must have at least one active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a cluster, use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeClusters.html">DescribeClusters</a> operation. To add HSMs to the cluster, use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_CreateHsm.html">CreateHsm</a> operation. Also, the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-concepts.html#concept-kmsuser"> <code>kmsuser</code> crypto user</a> (CU) must not be logged into the cluster. This prevents KMS from using this account to log in.</p> <p>If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting a CloudHSM key store, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html">Troubleshooting an CloudHSM key store</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>External key store</b> </p> <p>When you connect an external key store that uses public endpoint connectivity, KMS tests its ability to communicate with your external key manager by sending a request via the external key store proxy.</p> <p>When you connect to an external key store that uses VPC endpoint service connectivity, KMS establishes the networking elements that it needs to communicate with your external key manager via the external key store proxy. This includes creating an interface endpoint to the VPC endpoint service and a private hosted zone for traffic between KMS and the VPC endpoint service.</p> <p>To connect an external key store, KMS must be able to connect to the external key store proxy, the external key store proxy must be able to communicate with your external key manager, and the external key manager must be available for cryptographic operations.</p> <p>If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting an external key store, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/xks-troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting an external key store</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Cross-account use</b>: No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.</p> <p> <b>Required permissions</b>: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html">kms:ConnectCustomKeyStore</a> (IAM policy)</p> <p> <b>Related operations</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateCustomKeyStore</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteCustomKeyStore</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DisconnectCustomKeyStore</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateCustomKeyStore</a> </p> </li> </ul>'

You can use a KMS key in cryptographic operations, such as encryption and signing. Some Amazon Web Services services let you use KMS keys that you create and manage to protect your service resources.</p> <p>A KMS key is a logical representation of a cryptographic key. In addition to the key material used in cryptographic operations, a KMS key includes metadata, such as the key ID, key policy, creation date, description, and key state. For details, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html\">Managing keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i> </p> <p>Use the parameters of <code>CreateKey</code> to specify the type of KMS key, the source of its key material, its key policy, description, tags, and other properties.</p> <note> <p>KMS has replaced the term <i>customer master key (CMK)</i> with <i>KMS key</i> and <i>KMS key</i>. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, KMS is keeping some variations of this term.</p> </note> <p>To create different types of KMS keys, use the following guidance:</p> <dl> <dt>Symmetric encryption KMS key</dt> <dd> <p>By default, <code>CreateKey</code> creates a symmetric encryption KMS key with key material that KMS generates. This is the basic and most widely used type of KMS key, and provides the best performance.</p> <p>To create a symmetric encryption KMS key, you don't need to specify any parameters. The default value for <code>KeySpec</code>, <code>SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT</code>, the default value for <code>KeyUsage</code>, <code>ENCRYPT_DECRYPT</code>, and the default value for <code>Origin</code>, <code>AWS_KMS</code>, create a symmetric encryption KMS key with KMS key material.</p> <p>If you need a key for basic encryption and decryption or you are creating a KMS key to protect your resources in an Amazon Web Services service, create a symmetric encryption KMS key. The key material in a symmetric encryption key never leaves KMS unencrypted. You can use a symmetric encryption KMS key to encrypt and decrypt data up to 4,096 bytes, but they are typically used to generate data keys and data keys pairs. For details, see <a>GenerateDataKey</a> and <a>GenerateDataKeyPair</a>.</p> <p> </p> </dd> <dt>Asymmetric KMS keys</dt> <dd> <p>To create an asymmetric KMS key, use the <code>KeySpec</code> parameter to specify the type of key material in the KMS key. Then, use the <code>KeyUsage</code> parameter to determine whether the KMS key will be used to encrypt and decrypt or sign and verify. You can't change these properties after the KMS key is created.</p> <p>Asymmetric KMS keys contain an RSA key pair, Elliptic Curve (ECC) key pair, or an SM2 key pair (China Regions only). The private key in an asymmetric KMS key never leaves KMS unencrypted. However, you can use the <a>GetPublicKey</a> operation to download the public key so it can be used outside of KMS. KMS keys with RSA or SM2 key pairs can be used to encrypt or decrypt data or sign and verify messages (but not both). KMS keys with ECC key pairs can be used only to sign and verify messages. For information about asymmetric KMS keys, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html\">Asymmetric KMS keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p> </p> </dd> <dt>HMAC KMS key</dt> <dd> <p>To create an HMAC KMS key, set the <code>KeySpec</code> parameter to a key spec value for HMAC KMS keys. Then set the <code>KeyUsage</code> parameter to <code>GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC</code>. You must set the key usage even though <code>GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC</code> is the only valid key usage value for HMAC KMS keys. You can't change these properties after the KMS key is created.</p> <p>HMAC KMS keys are symmetric keys that never leave KMS unencrypted. You can use HMAC keys to generate (<a>GenerateMac</a>) and verify (<a>VerifyMac</a>) HMAC codes for messages up to 4096 bytes.</p> <p>HMAC KMS keys are not supported in all Amazon Web Services Regions. If you try to create an HMAC KMS key in an Amazon Web Services Region in which HMAC keys are not supported, the <code>CreateKey</code> operation returns an <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code>. For a list of Regions in which HMAC KMS keys are supported, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/hmac.html\">HMAC keys in KMS</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p> </p> </dd> <dt>Multi-Region primary keys</dt> <dt>Imported key material</dt> <dd> <p>To create a multi-Region <i>primary key</i> in the local Amazon Web Services Region, use the <code>MultiRegion</code> parameter with a value of <code>True</code>. To create a multi-Region <i>replica key</i>, that is, a KMS key with the same key ID and key material as a primary key, but in a different Amazon Web Services Region, use the <a>ReplicateKey</a> operation. To change a replica key to a primary key, and its primary key to a replica key, use the <a>UpdatePrimaryRegion</a> operation.</p> <p>You can create multi-Region KMS keys for all supported KMS key types: symmetric encryption KMS keys, HMAC KMS keys, asymmetric encryption KMS keys, and asymmetric signing KMS keys. You can also create multi-Region keys with imported key material. However, you can't create multi-Region keys in a custom key store.</p> <p>This operation supports <i>multi-Region keys</i>, an KMS feature that lets you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in a different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the data or making a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region keys, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html\">Multi-Region keys in KMS</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p> </p> </dd> <dd> <p>To import your own key material into a KMS key, begin by creating a symmetric encryption KMS key with no key material. To do this, use the <code>Origin</code> parameter of <code>CreateKey</code> with a value of <code>EXTERNAL</code>. Next, use <a>GetParametersForImport</a> operation to get a public key and import token, and use the public key to encrypt your key material. Then, use <a>ImportKeyMaterial</a> with your import token to import the key material. For step-by-step instructions, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html\">Importing Key Material</a> in the <i> <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i> </i>.</p> <p>This feature supports only symmetric encryption KMS keys, including multi-Region symmetric encryption KMS keys. You cannot import key material into any other type of KMS key.</p> <p>To create a multi-Region primary key with imported key material, use the <code>Origin</code> parameter of <code>CreateKey</code> with a value of <code>EXTERNAL</code> and the <code>MultiRegion</code> parameter with a value of <code>True</code>. To create replicas of the multi-Region primary key, use the <a>ReplicateKey</a> operation.

When you request a cryptographic operation with a KMS key in a custom key store, the operation is performed in the backing key store using its cryptographic keys.</p> <p>KMS supports <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-cloudhsm.html\">CloudHSM key stores</a> backed by an CloudHSM cluster and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-external.html\">external key stores</a> backed by an external key manager outside of Amazon Web Services. When you create a KMS key in an CloudHSM key store, KMS generates an encryption key in the CloudHSM cluster and associates it with the KMS key. When you create a KMS key in an external key store, you specify an existing encryption key in the external key manager.</p> <note> <p>Some external key managers provide a simpler method for creating a KMS key in an external key store. For details, see your external key manager documentation.</p> </note> <p>Before you create a KMS key in a custom key store, the <code>ConnectionState</code> of the key store must be <code>CONNECTED</code>. To connect the custom key store, use the <a>ConnectCustomKeyStore</a> operation. To find the <code>ConnectionState</code>, use the <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> operation.</p> <p>To create a KMS key in a custom key store, use the <code>CustomKeyStoreId</code>. Use the default <code>KeySpec</code> value, <code>SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT</code>, and the default <code>KeyUsage</code> value, <code>ENCRYPT_DECRYPT</code> to create a symmetric encryption key. No other key type is supported in a custom key store.</p> <p>To create a KMS key in an <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-cloudhsm.html\">CloudHSM key store</a>, use the <code>Origin</code> parameter with a value of <code>AWS_CLOUDHSM</code>.

When the KMS key is asymmetric, you must specify the KMS key and the encryption algorithm that was used to encrypt the ciphertext. For information about asymmetric KMS keys, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html\">Asymmetric KMS keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>The <code>Decrypt</code> operation also decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted outside of KMS by the public key in an KMS asymmetric KMS key. However, it cannot decrypt symmetric ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/\">Amazon Web Services Encryption SDK</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html\">Amazon S3 client-side encryption</a>. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with KMS.</p> <p>If the ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric encryption KMS key, the <code>KeyId</code> parameter is optional. KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even if they've lost track of the key ID. However, specifying the KMS key is always recommended as a best practice. When you use the <code>KeyId</code> parameter to specify a KMS key, KMS only uses the KMS key you specify. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different KMS key, the <code>Decrypt</code> operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you intend.</p> <p>Whenever possible, use key policies to give users permission to call the <code>Decrypt</code> operation on a particular KMS key, instead of using &amp;IAM; policies. Otherwise, you might create an &amp;IAM; policy that gives the user <code>Decrypt</code> permission on all KMS keys. This user could decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by KMS keys in other accounts if the key policy for the cross-account KMS key permits it. If you must use an IAM policy for <code>Decrypt</code> permissions, limit the user to particular KMS keys or particular trusted accounts.

      description: "<p>Returns a unique symmetric data key for use outside of KMS. This operation returns a data key that is encrypted under a symmetric encryption KMS key that you specify. The bytes in the key are random; they are not related to the caller or to the KMS key.</p> <p> <code>GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext</code> is identical to the <a>GenerateDataKey</a> operation except that it does not return a plaintext copy of the data key. </p> <p>This operation is useful for systems that need to encrypt data at some point, but not immediately. When you need to encrypt the data, you call the <a>Decrypt</a> operation on the encrypted copy of the key.</p> <p>It's also useful in distributed systems with different levels of trust. For example, you might store encrypted data in containers. One component of your system creates new containers and stores an encrypted data key with each container. Then, a different component puts the data into the containers. That component first decrypts the data key, uses the plaintext data key to encrypt data, puts the encrypted data into the container, and then destroys the plaintext data key. In this system, the component that creates the containers never sees the plaintext data key.</p> <p>To request an asymmetric data key pair, use the <a>GenerateDataKeyPair</a> or <a>GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext</a> operations.</p> <p>To generate a data key, you must specify the symmetric encryption KMS key that is used to encrypt the data key. You cannot use an asymmetric KMS key or a key in a custom key store to generate a data key. To get the type of your KMS key, use the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation.</p> <p>You must also specify the length of the data key. Use either the <code>KeySpec</code> or <code>NumberOfBytes</code> parameters (but not both). For 128-bit and 256-bit data keys, use the <code>KeySpec</code> parameter.</p> <p>To generate an SM4 data key (China Regions only), specify a <code>KeySpec</code> value of <code>AES_128</code> or <code>NumberOfBytes</code> value of <code>128</code>. The symmetric encryption key used in China Regions to encrypt your data key is an SM4 encryption key.</p> <p>If the operation succeeds, you will find the encrypted copy of the data key in the <code>CiphertextBlob</code> field.</p> <p>You can use an optional encryption context to add additional security to the encryption operation. If you specify an <code>EncryptionContext</code>, you must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the encrypted data key. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an <code>InvalidCiphertextException</code>.

      description: '<p>Returns the public key of an asymmetric KMS key. Unlike the private key of a asymmetric KMS key, which never leaves KMS unencrypted, callers with <code>kms:GetPublicKey</code> permission can download the public key of an asymmetric KMS key. You can share the public key to allow others to encrypt messages and verify signatures outside of KMS. For information about asymmetric KMS keys, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html">Asymmetric KMS keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>You do not need to download the public key. Instead, you can use the public key within KMS by calling the <a>Encrypt</a>, <a>ReEncrypt</a>, or <a>Verify</a> operations with the identifier of an asymmetric KMS key. When you use the public key within KMS, you benefit from the authentication, authorization, and logging that are part of every KMS operation. You also reduce of risk of encrypting data that cannot be decrypted. These features are not effective outside of KMS.</p> <p>To help you use the public key safely outside of KMS, <code>GetPublicKey</code> returns important information about the public key in the response, including:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-KeySpec">KeySpec</a>: The type of key material in the public key, such as <code>RSA_4096</code> or <code>ECC_NIST_P521</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-KeyUsage">KeyUsage</a>: Whether the key is used for encryption or signing.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-EncryptionAlgorithms">EncryptionAlgorithms</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-SigningAlgorithms">SigningAlgorithms</a>: A list of the encryption algorithms or the signing algorithms for the key.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Although KMS cannot enforce these restrictions on external operations, it is crucial that you use this information to prevent the public key from being used improperly. For example, you can prevent a public signing key from being used encrypt data, or prevent a public key from being used with an encryption algorithm that is not supported by KMS. You can also avoid errors, such as using the wrong signing algorithm in a verification operation.</p> <p>To verify a signature outside of KMS with an SM2 public key (China Regions only), you must specify the distinguishing ID. By default, KMS uses <code>1234567812345678</code> as the distinguishing ID.

You can also use it to reencrypt ciphertext under the same KMS key, such as to change the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context\">encryption context</a> of a ciphertext.</p> <p>The <code>ReEncrypt</code> operation can decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using a KMS key in an KMS operation, such as <a>Encrypt</a> or <a>GenerateDataKey</a>. It can also decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using the public key of an <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symm-asymm-concepts.html#asymmetric-cmks\">asymmetric KMS key</a> outside of KMS. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/\">Amazon Web Services Encryption SDK</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html\">Amazon S3 client-side encryption</a>. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with KMS.</p> <p>When you use the <code>ReEncrypt</code> operation, you need to provide information for the decrypt operation and the subsequent encrypt operation.</p> <ul> <li> <p>If your ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric KMS key, you must use the <code>SourceKeyId</code> parameter to identify the KMS key that encrypted the ciphertext. You must also supply the encryption algorithm that was used. This information is required to decrypt the data.</p> </li> <li> <p>If your ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric encryption KMS key, the <code>SourceKeyId</code> parameter is optional. KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even if they've lost track of the key ID. However, specifying the source KMS key is always recommended as a best practice. When you use the <code>SourceKeyId</code> parameter to specify a KMS key, KMS uses only the KMS key you specify. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different KMS key, the <code>ReEncrypt</code> operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you intend.</p> </li> <li> <p>To reencrypt the data, you must use the <code>DestinationKeyId</code> parameter to specify the KMS key that re-encrypts the data after it is decrypted. If the destination KMS key is an asymmetric KMS key, you must also provide the encryption algorithm. The algorithm that you choose must be compatible with the KMS key.</p> <important> <p>When you use an asymmetric KMS key to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the KMS key and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the same KMS key and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the KMS key and algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails.</p> <p>You are not required to supply the key ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt with symmetric encryption KMS keys because KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob. KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable fields.</p> </important> </li> </ul> <p>The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state.

The source KMS key and destination KMS key can be in different Amazon Web Services accounts. Either or both KMS keys can be in a different account than the caller.

To create a multi-Region primary key, use the <a>CreateKey</a> operation.</p> <p>This operation supports <i>multi-Region keys</i>, an KMS feature that lets you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in a different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the data or making a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region keys, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html\">Multi-Region keys in KMS</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>A <i>replica key</i> is a fully-functional KMS key that can be used independently of its primary and peer replica keys. A primary key and its replica keys share properties that make them interoperable. They have the same <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-id-key-id\">key ID</a> and key material. They also have the same <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-spec\">key spec</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-usage\">key usage</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-origin\">key material origin</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html\">automatic key rotation status</a>. KMS automatically synchronizes these shared properties among related multi-Region keys. All other properties of a replica key can differ, including its <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html\">key policy</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/tagging-keys.html\">tags</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-alias.html\">aliases</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html\">Key states of KMS keys</a>. KMS pricing and quotas for KMS keys apply to each primary key and replica key.</p> <p>When this operation completes, the new replica key has a transient key state of <code>Creating</code>. This key state changes to <code>Enabled</code> (or <code>PendingImport</code>) after a few seconds when the process of creating the new replica key is complete. While the key state is <code>Creating</code>, you can manage key, but you cannot yet use it in cryptographic operations. If you are creating and using the replica key programmatically, retry on <code>KMSInvalidStateException</code> or call <code>DescribeKey</code> to check its <code>KeyState</code> value before using it. For details about the <code>Creating</code> key state, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html\">Key states of KMS keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>You cannot create more than one replica of a primary key in any Region. If the Region already includes a replica of the key you're trying to replicate, <code>ReplicateKey</code> returns an <code>AlreadyExistsException</code> error. If the key state of the existing replica is <code>PendingDeletion</code>, you can cancel the scheduled key deletion (<a>CancelKeyDeletion</a>) or wait for the key to be deleted. The new replica key you create will have the same <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html#mrk-sync-properties\">shared properties</a> as the original replica key.</p> <p>The CloudTrail log of a <code>ReplicateKey</code> operation records a <code>ReplicateKey</code> operation in the primary key's Region and a <a>CreateKey</a> operation in the replica key's Region.</p> <p>If you replicate a multi-Region primary key with imported key material, the replica key is created with no key material. You must import the same key material that you imported into the primary key. For details, see <a href=\"kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-import.html\">Importing key material into multi-Region keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>To convert a replica key to a primary key, use the <a>UpdatePrimaryRegion</a> operation.</p> <note> <p> <code>ReplicateKey</code> uses different default values for the <code>KeyPolicy</code> and <code>Tags</code> parameters than those used in the KMS console. For details, see the parameter descriptions.</p> </note> <p> <b>Cross-account use</b>: No. You cannot use this operation to create a replica key in a different Amazon Web Services account. </p> <p> <b>Required permissions</b>: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>kms:ReplicateKey</code> on the primary key (in the primary key's Region).

      description: "<p>Creates a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature\">digital signature</a> for a message or message digest by using the private key in an asymmetric signing KMS key. To verify the signature, use the <a>Verify</a> operation, or use the public key in the same asymmetric KMS key outside of KMS. For information about asymmetric KMS keys, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html\">Asymmetric KMS keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>Digital signatures are generated and verified by using asymmetric key pair, such as an RSA or ECC pair that is represented by an asymmetric KMS key. The key owner (or an authorized user) uses their private key to sign a message. Anyone with the public key can verify that the message was signed with that particular private key and that the message hasn't changed since it was signed. </p> <p>To use the <code>Sign</code> operation, provide the following information:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use the <code>KeyId</code> parameter to identify an asymmetric KMS key with a <code>KeyUsage</code> value of <code>SIGN_VERIFY</code>. To get the <code>KeyUsage</code> value of a KMS key, use the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation. The caller must have <code>kms:Sign</code> permission on the KMS key.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the <code>Message</code> parameter to specify the message or message digest to sign. You can submit messages of up to 4096 bytes. To sign a larger message, generate a hash digest of the message, and then provide the hash digest in the <code>Message</code> parameter. To indicate whether the message is a full message or a digest, use the <code>MessageType</code> parameter.</p> </li> <li> <p>Choose a signing algorithm that is compatible with the KMS key. </p> </li> </ul> <important> <p>When signing a message, be sure to record the KMS key and the signing algorithm. This information is required to verify the signature.</p> </important> <note> <p>Best practices recommend that you limit the time during which any signature is effective. This deters an attack where the actor uses a signed message to establish validity repeatedly or long after the message is superseded. Signatures do not include a timestamp, but you can include a timestamp in the signed message to help you detect when its time to refresh the signature. </p> </note> <p>To verify the signature that this operation generates, use the <a>Verify</a> operation. Or use the <a>GetPublicKey</a> operation to download the public key and then use the public key to verify the signature outside of KMS. </p> <p>The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html\">Key states of KMS keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Cross-account use</b>: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the <code>KeyId</code> parameter.</p> <p> <b>Required permissions</b>: <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html\">kms:Sign</a> (key policy)</p> <p> <b>Related operations</b>: <a>Verify</a> </p>"

To verify the updated property values, use the <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> operation.</p> <p> This operation is part of the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html">custom key stores</a> feature in KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with the isolation and control of a key store that you own and manage.</p> <important> <p>When updating the properties of an external key store, verify that the updated settings connect your key store, via the external key store proxy, to the same external key manager as the previous settings, or to a backup or snapshot of the external key manager with the same cryptographic keys. If the updated connection settings fail, you can fix them and retry, although an extended delay might disrupt Amazon Web Services services. However, if KMS permanently loses its access to cryptographic keys, ciphertext encrypted under those keys is unrecoverable.</p> </important> <note> <p>For external key stores:</p> <p>Some external key managers provide a simpler method for updating an external key store. For details, see your external key manager documentation.</p> <p>When updating an external key store in the KMS console, you can upload a JSON-based proxy configuration file with the desired values. You cannot upload the proxy configuration file to the <code>UpdateCustomKeyStore</code> operation. However, you can use the file to help you determine the correct values for the <code>UpdateCustomKeyStore</code> parameters.</p> </note> <p>For an CloudHSM key store, you can use this operation to change the custom key store friendly name (<code>NewCustomKeyStoreName</code>), to tell KMS about a change to the <code>kmsuser</code> crypto user password (<code>KeyStorePassword</code>), or to associate the custom key store with a different, but related, CloudHSM cluster (<code>CloudHsmClusterId</code>). To update any property of an CloudHSM key store, the <code>ConnectionState</code> of the CloudHSM key store must be <code>DISCONNECTED</code>. </p> <p>For an external key store, you can use this operation to change the custom key store friendly name (<code>NewCustomKeyStoreName</code>), or to tell KMS about a change to the external key store proxy authentication credentials (<code>XksProxyAuthenticationCredential</code>), connection method (<code>XksProxyConnectivity</code>), external proxy endpoint (<code>XksProxyUriEndpoint</code>) and path (<code>XksProxyUriPath</code>). For external key stores with an <code>XksProxyConnectivity</code> of <code>VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE</code>, you can also update the Amazon VPC endpoint service name (<code>XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceName</code>). To update most properties of an external key store, the <code>ConnectionState</code> of the external key store must be <code>DISCONNECTED</code>. However, you can update the <code>CustomKeyStoreName</code>, <code>XksProxyAuthenticationCredential</code>, and <code>XksProxyUriPath</code> of an external key store when it is in the CONNECTED or DISCONNECTED state. </p> <p>If your update requires a <code>DISCONNECTED</code> state, before using <code>UpdateCustomKeyStore</code>, use the <a>DisconnectCustomKeyStore</a> operation to disconnect the custom key store. After the <code>UpdateCustomKeyStore</code> operation completes, use the <a>ConnectCustomKeyStore</a> to reconnect the custom key store. To find the <code>ConnectionState</code> of the custom key store, use the <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> operation. </p> <p> </p> <p>Before updating the custom key store, verify that the new values allow KMS to connect the custom key store to its backing key store. For example, before you change the <code>XksProxyUriPath</code> value, verify that the external key store proxy is reachable at the new path.</p> <p>If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties.</p> <p> <b>Cross-account use</b>: No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.</p> <p> <b>Required permissions</b>: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html">kms:UpdateCustomKeyStore</a> (IAM policy)</p> <p> <b>Related operations:</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>ConnectCustomKeyStore</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>CreateCustomKeyStore</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteCustomKeyStore</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DisconnectCustomKeyStore</a> </p> </li> </ul>'

To create a <i>replica key</i>, use the <a>ReplicateKey</a> operation. </p> <p>You can create a symmetric or asymmetric multi-Region key, and you can create a multi-Region key with imported key material. However, you cannot create a multi-Region key in a custom key store.</p>

On operations with symmetric encryption KMS keys, an encryption context is optional, but it is strongly recommended.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context">Encryption context</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>
