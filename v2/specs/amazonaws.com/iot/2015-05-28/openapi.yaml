  description: '<fullname>IoT</fullname> <p>IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected devices (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices, or smart appliances) and the Amazon Web Services cloud. You can discover your custom IoT-Data endpoint to communicate with, configure rules for data processing and integration with other services, organize resources associated with each device (Registry), configure logging, and create and manage policies and credentials to authenticate devices.</p> <p>The service endpoints that expose this API are listed in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html">Amazon Web Services IoT Core Endpoints and Quotas</a>. You must use the endpoint for the region that has the resources you want to access.</p> <p>The service name used by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4</a> to sign the request is: <i>execute-api</i>.</p> <p>For more information about how IoT works, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/aws-iot-how-it-works.html">Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p>For information about how to use the credentials provider for IoT, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/authorizing-direct-aws.html">Authorizing Direct Calls to Amazon Web Services Services</a>.</p>'

      description: '<p>Groups the aggregated values that match the query into percentile groupings. The default percentile groupings are: 1,5,25,50,75,95,99, although you can specify your own when you call <code>GetPercentiles</code>. This function returns a value for each percentile group specified (or the default percentile groupings). The percentile group "1" contains the aggregated field value that occurs in approximately one percent of the values that match the query. The percentile group "5" contains the aggregated field value that occurs in approximately five percent of the values that match the query, and so on. The result is an approximation, the more values that match the query, the more accurate the percentile values.</p> <p>Requires permission to access the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsiot.html#awsiot-actions-as-permissions">GetPercentiles</a> action.</p>'

You can use a string as the algorithm name if the target over-the-air (OTA) update devices are able to verify the signature that was generated using the same signature algorithm. For example, FreeRTOS uses <code>ECDSA</code> or <code>RSA</code>, so you can pass either of them based on which was used for generating the signature.
