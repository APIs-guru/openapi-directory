  title: Amazon CloudWatch
  description: <p>Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services) resources and the applications you run on Amazon Web Services in real time. You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are the variables you want to measure for your resources and applications.</p> <p>CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically change the resources you are monitoring based on rules that you define. For example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon EC2 instances. Then, use this data to determine whether you should launch additional instances to handle increased load. You can also use this data to stop under-used instances to save money.</p> <p>In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with Amazon Web Services, you can monitor your own custom metrics. With CloudWatch, you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health.</p>

      description: Lists the anomaly detection models that you have created in your account. For single metric anomaly detectors, you can list all of the models in your account or filter the results to only the models that are related to a certain namespace, metric name, or metric dimension. For metric math anomaly detectors, you can list them by adding <code>METRIC_MATH</code> to the <code>AnomalyDetectorTypes</code> array. This will return all metric math anomaly detectors in your account.

      description: <p>You can use the <code>GetMetricData</code> API to retrieve CloudWatch metric values. The operation can also include a CloudWatch Metrics Insights query, and one or more metric math functions.</p> <p>A <code>GetMetricData</code> operation that does not include a query can retrieve as many as 500 different metrics in a single request, with a total of as many as 100,800 data points. You can also optionally perform metric math expressions on the values of the returned statistics, to create new time series that represent new insights into your data. For example, using Lambda metrics, you could divide the Errors metric by the Invocations metric to get an error rate time series. For more information about metric math expressions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax">Metric Math Syntax and Functions</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch User Guide</i>.</p> <p>If you include a Metrics Insights query, each <code>GetMetricData</code> operation can include only one query. But the same <code>GetMetricData</code> operation can also retrieve other metrics. Metrics Insights queries can query only the most recent three hours of metric data. For more information about Metrics Insights, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/query_with_cloudwatch-metrics-insights.html">Query your metrics with CloudWatch Metrics Insights</a>.</p> <p>Calls to the <code>GetMetricData</code> API have a different pricing structure than calls to <code>GetMetricStatistics</code>. For more information about pricing, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/">Amazon CloudWatch Pricing</a>.</p> <p>Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are available only for custom metrics that have been defined with a <code>StorageResolution</code> of 1.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for 15 days.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for 63 days.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute resolution. After 15 days, this data is still available, but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is available with a resolution of 1 hour.</p> <p>If you omit <code>Unit</code> in your request, all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.</p> <p> <b>Using Metrics Insights queries with metric math</b> </p> <p>You can't mix a Metric Insights query and metric math syntax in the same expression, but you can reference results from a Metrics Insights query within other Metric math expressions. A Metrics Insights query without a <b>GROUP BY</b> clause returns a single time-series (TS), and can be used as input for a metric math expression that expects a single time series. A Metrics Insights query with a <b>GROUP BY</b> clause returns an array of time-series (TS[]), and can be used as input for a metric math expression that expects an array of time series. </p>

      description: <p>You can use the <code>GetMetricData</code> API to retrieve CloudWatch metric values. The operation can also include a CloudWatch Metrics Insights query, and one or more metric math functions.</p> <p>A <code>GetMetricData</code> operation that does not include a query can retrieve as many as 500 different metrics in a single request, with a total of as many as 100,800 data points. You can also optionally perform metric math expressions on the values of the returned statistics, to create new time series that represent new insights into your data. For example, using Lambda metrics, you could divide the Errors metric by the Invocations metric to get an error rate time series. For more information about metric math expressions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax">Metric Math Syntax and Functions</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch User Guide</i>.</p> <p>If you include a Metrics Insights query, each <code>GetMetricData</code> operation can include only one query. But the same <code>GetMetricData</code> operation can also retrieve other metrics. Metrics Insights queries can query only the most recent three hours of metric data. For more information about Metrics Insights, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/query_with_cloudwatch-metrics-insights.html">Query your metrics with CloudWatch Metrics Insights</a>.</p> <p>Calls to the <code>GetMetricData</code> API have a different pricing structure than calls to <code>GetMetricStatistics</code>. For more information about pricing, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/">Amazon CloudWatch Pricing</a>.</p> <p>Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are available only for custom metrics that have been defined with a <code>StorageResolution</code> of 1.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for 15 days.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for 63 days.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute resolution. After 15 days, this data is still available, but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is available with a resolution of 1 hour.</p> <p>If you omit <code>Unit</code> in your request, all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.</p> <p> <b>Using Metrics Insights queries with metric math</b> </p> <p>You can't mix a Metric Insights query and metric math syntax in the same expression, but you can reference results from a Metrics Insights query within other Metric math expressions. A Metrics Insights query without a <b>GROUP BY</b> clause returns a single time-series (TS), and can be used as input for a metric math expression that expects a single time series. A Metrics Insights query with a <b>GROUP BY</b> clause returns an array of time-series (TS[]), and can be used as input for a metric math expression that expects an array of time series. </p>

      description: <p>Gets statistics for the specified metric.</p> <p>The maximum number of data points returned from a single call is 1,440. If you request more than 1,440 data points, CloudWatch returns an error.

      description: <p>Gets statistics for the specified metric.</p> <p>The maximum number of data points returned from a single call is 1,440. If you request more than 1,440 data points, CloudWatch returns an error. To reduce the number of data points, you can narrow the specified time range and make multiple requests across adjacent time ranges, or you can increase the specified period. Data points are not returned in chronological order.</p> <p>CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period that you specify. For example, if you request statistics with a one-hour period, CloudWatch aggregates all data points with time stamps that fall within each one-hour period. Therefore, the number of values aggregated by CloudWatch is larger than the number of data points returned.</p> <p>CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The SampleCount value of the statistic set is 1.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Min and the Max values of the statistic set are equal.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Percentile statistics are not available for metrics when any of the metric values are negative numbers.</p> <p>Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are available only for custom metrics that have been defined with a <code>StorageResolution</code> of 1.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for 15 days.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for 63 days.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute resolution. After 15 days, this data is still available, but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is available with a resolution of 1 hour.</p> <p>CloudWatch started retaining 5-minute and 1-hour metric data as of July 9, 2016.</p> <p>For information about metrics and dimensions supported by Amazon Web Services services, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CW_Support_For_AWS.html">Amazon CloudWatch Metrics and Dimensions Reference</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch User Guide</i>.</p>

      description: <p>Creates or updates a <i>composite alarm</i>. When you create a composite alarm, you specify a rule expression for the alarm that takes into account the alarm states of other alarms that you have created. The composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if all conditions of the rule are met.</p> <p>The alarms specified in a composite alarm's rule expression can include metric alarms and other composite alarms. The rule expression of a composite alarm can include as many as 100 underlying alarms. Any single alarm can be included in the rule expressions of as many as 150 composite alarms.</p> <p>Using composite alarms can reduce alarm noise. You can create multiple metric alarms, and also create a composite alarm and set up alerts only for the composite alarm. For example, you could create a composite alarm that goes into ALARM state only when more than one of the underlying metric alarms are in ALARM state.</p> <p>Currently, the only alarm actions that can be taken by composite alarms are notifying SNS topics.</p> <note> <p>It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where composite alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B also depends on composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can't delete any composite alarm that is part of the cycle because there is always still a composite alarm that depends on that alarm that you want to delete.</p> <p>To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing the rule of one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a dependency that creates the cycle.

If you are creating an alarm based on a metric math expression, you specify the period for each metric within the objects in the <code>Metrics</code> array.</p> <p>Be sure to specify 10 or 30 only for metrics that are stored by a <code>PutMetricData</code> call with a <code>StorageResolution</code> of 1. If you specify a period of 10 or 30 for a metric that does not have sub-minute resolution, the alarm still attempts to gather data at the period rate that you specify. In this case, it does not receive data for the attempts that do not correspond to a one-minute data resolution, and the alarm might often lapse into INSUFFICENT_DATA status. Specifying 10 or 30 also sets this alarm as a high-resolution alarm, which has a higher charge than other alarms.

Metric data points that specify a unit of measure, such as Percent, are aggregated separately.</p> <p>If you don't specify <code>Unit</code>, CloudWatch retrieves all unit types that have been published for the metric and attempts to evaluate the alarm. Usually, metrics are published with only one unit, so the alarm works as intended.</p> <p>However, if the metric is published with multiple types of units and you don't specify a unit, the alarm's behavior is not defined and it behaves unpredictably.</p> <p>We recommend omitting <code>Unit</code> so that you don't inadvertently specify an incorrect unit that is not published for this metric.

Because the metric alarm state change happens quickly, it is typically only visible in the alarm's <b>History</b> tab in the Amazon CloudWatch console or through <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAlarmHistory.html">DescribeAlarmHistory</a>.</p> <p>If you use <code>SetAlarmState</code> on a composite alarm, the composite alarm is not guaranteed to return to its actual state. It returns to its actual state only once any of its children alarms change state. It is also reevaluated if you update its configuration.</p> <p>If an alarm triggers EC2 Auto Scaling policies or application Auto Scaling policies, you must include information in the <code>StateReasonData</code> parameter to enable the policy to take the correct action.</p>

If you are creating an alarm based on a metric math expression, you specify the period for each metric within the objects in the <code>Metrics</code> array.</p> <p>Be sure to specify 10 or 30 only for metrics that are stored by a <code>PutMetricData</code> call with a <code>StorageResolution</code> of 1. If you specify a period of 10 or 30 for a metric that does not have sub-minute resolution, the alarm still attempts to gather data at the period rate that you specify. In this case, it does not receive data for the attempts that do not correspond to a one-minute data resolution, and the alarm might often lapse into INSUFFICENT_DATA status. Specifying 10 or 30 also sets this alarm as a high-resolution alarm, which has a higher charge than other alarms. For more information about pricing, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/">Amazon CloudWatch Pricing</a>.</p> <p>An alarm's total current evaluation period can be no longer than one day, so <code>Period</code> multiplied by <code>EvaluationPeriods</code> cannot be more than 86,400 seconds.</p>

For example, the units for the Amazon EC2 NetworkIn metric are Bytes because NetworkIn tracks the number of bytes that an instance receives on all network interfaces. You can also specify a unit when you create a custom metric. Units help provide conceptual meaning to your data. Metric data points that specify a unit of measure, such as Percent, are aggregated separately.</p> <p>If you don't specify <code>Unit</code>, CloudWatch retrieves all unit types that have been published for the metric and attempts to evaluate the alarm. Usually, metrics are published with only one unit, so the alarm works as intended.</p> <p>However, if the metric is published with multiple types of units and you don't specify a unit, the alarm's behavior is not defined and it behaves unpredictably.</p> <p>We recommend omitting <code>Unit</code> so that you don't inadvertently specify an incorrect unit that is not published for this metric.
