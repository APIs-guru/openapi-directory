This type of result usually doesn't require immediate action.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>WARNING</code> - A warning result draws special attention to fields that might cause issues for your detector model. We recommend that you review warnings and take necessary actions before you use your detector model in production environments. Otherwise, the detector model might not work as expected.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ERROR</code> - An error result notifies you about a problem found in your detector model.
