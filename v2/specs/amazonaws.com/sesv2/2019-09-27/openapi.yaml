      description: <p>Starts the process of verifying an email identity. An <i>identity</i> is an email address or domain that you use when you send email. Before you can use an identity to send email, you first have to verify it. By verifying an identity, you demonstrate that you're the owner of the identity, and that you've given Amazon SES API v2 permission to send email from the identity.</p> <p>When you verify an email address, Amazon SES sends an email to the address. Your email address is verified as soon as you follow the link in the verification email. </p> <p>When you verify a domain without specifying the <code>DkimSigningAttributes</code> object, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens. You can convert these tokens into CNAME records, which you then add to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon SES detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain. This verification method is known as <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/easy-dkim.html">Easy DKIM</a>.</p> <p>Alternatively, you can perform the verification process by providing your own public-private key pair. This verification method is known as Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM). To use BYODKIM, your call to the <code>CreateEmailIdentity</code> operation has to include the <code>DkimSigningAttributes</code> object. When you specify this object, you provide a selector (a component of the DNS record name that identifies the public key to use for DKIM authentication) and a private key.</p> <p>When you verify a domain, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens, which you can convert into CNAME tokens. You add these CNAME tokens to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon SES detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain. For some DNS providers, it can take 72 hours or more to complete the domain verification process.</p> <p>Additionally, you can associate an existing configuration set with the email identity that you're verifying.</p>

If you used <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/easy-dkim.html">Easy DKIM</a> to set up DKIM authentication, Amazon SES tries to find three unique CNAME records in the DNS configuration for your domain.</p> <p>If you provided a public key to perform DKIM authentication, Amazon SES tries to find a TXT record that uses the selector that you specified. The value of the TXT record must be a public key that's paired with the private key that you specified in the process of creating the identity.</p> <p>The status can be one of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>PENDING</code> – The verification process was initiated, but Amazon SES hasn't yet detected the DKIM records in the DNS configuration for the domain.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>SUCCESS</code> – The verification process completed successfully.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>FAILED</code> – The verification process failed. This typically occurs when Amazon SES fails to find the DKIM records in the DNS configuration of the domain.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>TEMPORARY_FAILURE</code> – A temporary issue is preventing Amazon SES from determining the DKIM authentication status of the domain.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>NOT_STARTED</code> – The DKIM verification process hasn't been initiated for the domain.</p> </li> </ul>

When you perform a predictive inbox placement test, you provide a sample message that contains the content that you plan to send to your customers. We send that message to special email addresses spread across several major email providers around the world. The test takes about 24 hours to complete. When the test is complete, you can use the <code>GetDeliverabilityTestReport</code> operation to view the results of the test.
