  title: AWS Organizations
  description: <p>Organizations is a web service that enables you to consolidate your multiple Amazon Web Services accounts into an <i>organization</i> and centrally manage your accounts and their resources.</p> <p>This guide provides descriptions of the Organizations operations. For more information about using this service, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html">Organizations User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>Support and feedback for Organizations</b> </p> <p>We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to <a href="mailto:feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com">feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com</a> or post your feedback and questions in the <a href="http://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=219">Organizations support forum</a>. For more information about the Amazon Web Services support forums, see <a href="http://forums.aws.amazon.com/help.jspa">Forums Help</a>.</p> <p> <b>Endpoint to call When using the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDK</b> </p> <p>For the current release of Organizations, specify the <code>us-east-1</code> region for all Amazon Web Services API and CLI calls made from the commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China. If calling from one of the Amazon Web Services Regions in China, then specify <code>cn-northwest-1</code>. You can do this in the CLI by using these parameters and commands:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use the following parameter with each command to specify both the endpoint and its region:</p> <p> <code>--endpoint-url https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</code> <i>(from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)</i> </p> <p>or</p> <p> <code>--endpoint-url https://organizations.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn</code> <i>(from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)</i> </p> </li> <li> <p>Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with this command:</p> <p> <code>aws configure set default.region us-east-1</code> <i>(from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)</i> </p> <p>or</p> <p> <code>aws configure set default.region cn-northwest-1</code> <i>(from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)</i> </p> </li> <li> <p>Use the following parameter with each command to specify the endpoint:</p> <p> <code>--region us-east-1</code> <i>(from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)</i> </p> <p>or</p> <p> <code>--region cn-northwest-1</code> <i>(from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)</i> </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Recording API Requests</b> </p> <p>Organizations supports CloudTrail, a service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine which requests the Organizations service received, who made the request and when, and so on. For more about Organizations and its support for CloudTrail, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_incident-response.html#orgs_cloudtrail-integration">Logging Organizations Events with CloudTrail</a> in the <i>Organizations User Guide</i>. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html">CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p>

      operationId: CloseAccount
      description: <p>Closes an Amazon Web Services member account within an organization. You can close an account when <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html">all features are enabled </a>. You can't close the management account with this API. This is an asynchronous request that Amazon Web Services performs in the background. Because <code>CloseAccount</code> operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account closure might still be in progress. You need to wait a few minutes before the account is fully closed. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use the <code>AccountId</code> that you sent in the <code>CloseAccount</code> request to provide as a parameter to the <a>DescribeAccount</a> operation. </p> <p>While the close account request is in progress, Account status will indicate PENDING_CLOSURE. When the close account request completes, the status will change to SUSPENDED. </p> </li> <li> <p>Check the CloudTrail log for the <code>CloseAccountResult</code> event that gets published after the account closes successfully. For information on using CloudTrail with Organizations, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_security_incident-response.html#orgs_cloudtrail-integration">Logging and monitoring in Organizations</a> in the <i>Organizations User Guide.</i> </p> </li> </ul> <note> <ul> <li> <p>You can close only 10% of member accounts, between 10 and 200, within a rolling 30 day period. This quota is not bound by a calendar month, but starts when you close an account.</p> <p>After you reach this limit, you can close additional accounts in the Billing console. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/close-account.html">Closing an account</a> in the Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management User Guide.</p> </li> <li> <p>To reinstate a closed account, contact Amazon Web Services Support within the 90-day grace period while the account is in SUSPENDED status. </p> </li> <li> <p>If the Amazon Web Services account you attempt to close is linked to an Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account, the <code>CloseAccount</code> request will close both accounts. To learn important pre-closure details, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/Closing-govcloud-account.html"> Closing an Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account</a> in the <i> Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> </note> <p>For more information about closing accounts, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_close.html">Closing an Amazon Web Services account</a> in the <i>Organizations User Guide.</i> </p>
