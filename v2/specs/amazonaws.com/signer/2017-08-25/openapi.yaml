  title: AWS Signer
  description: <p>AWS Signer is a fully managed code signing service to help you ensure the trust and integrity of your code. </p> <p>AWS Signer supports the following applications:</p> <p>With <i>code signing for AWS Lambda</i>, you can sign AWS Lambda deployment packages. Integrated support is provided for Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch, and AWS CloudTrail. In order to sign code, you create a signing profile and then use Signer to sign Lambda zip files in S3. </p> <p>With <i>code signing for IoT</i>, you can sign code for any IoT device that is supported by AWS. IoT code signing is available for <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/">Amazon FreeRTOS</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/">AWS IoT Device Management</a>, and is integrated with <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/">AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)</a>. In order to sign code, you import a third-party code signing certificate using ACM, and use that to sign updates in Amazon FreeRTOS and AWS IoT Device Management. </p> <p>For more information about AWS Signer, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html">AWS Signer Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p/>

      description: Lists all available signing profiles in your AWS account. Returns only profiles with an <code>ACTIVE</code> status unless the <code>includeCanceled</code> request field is set to <code>true</code>. If additional jobs remain to be listed, code signing returns a <code>nextToken</code> value. Use this value in subsequent calls to <code>ListSigningJobs</code> to fetch the remaining values. You can continue calling <code>ListSigningJobs</code> with your <code>maxResults</code> parameter and with new values that code signing returns in the <code>nextToken</code> parameter until all of your signing jobs have been returned.
