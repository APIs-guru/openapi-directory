It randomly selects a sample of matching groups from the existing matching results, and applies the automerging settings that you provided. You can then view the number of profiles in the sample, the number of matches, and the number of profiles identified to be merged. This enables you to evaluate the accuracy of the attributes in your matching list. </p> <p>You can't view which profiles are matched and would be merged.</p> <important> <p>We strongly recommend you use this API to do a dry run of the automerging process before running the Identity Resolution Job. Include <b>at least</b> two matching attributes. If your matching list includes too few attributes (such as only <code>FirstName</code> or only <code>LastName</code>), there may be a large number of matches. This increases the chances of erroneous merges.</p> </important>

PROFILE, ASSET, CASE, or ORDER means that this key can be used to tie an object to a PROFILE, ASSET, CASE, or ORDER respectively. UNIQUE means that it can be used to uniquely identify an object. If a key a is marked as SECONDARY, it will be used to search for profiles after all other PROFILE keys have been searched. A LOOKUP_ONLY key is only used to match a profile but is not persisted to be used for searching of the profile. A NEW_ONLY key is only used if the profile does not already exist before the object is ingested, otherwise it is only used for matching objects to profiles.
