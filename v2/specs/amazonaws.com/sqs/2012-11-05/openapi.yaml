      operationId: GET_ChangeMessageVisibility
      description: <p>Changes the visibility timeout of a specified message in a queue to a new value. The default visibility timeout for a message is 30 seconds. The minimum is 0 seconds. The maximum is 12 hours. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html">Visibility Timeout</a> in the <i>Amazon SQS Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>For example, you have a message with a visibility timeout of 5 minutes. After 3 minutes, you call <code>ChangeMessageVisibility</code> with a timeout of 10 minutes. You can continue to call <code>ChangeMessageVisibility</code> to extend the visibility timeout to the maximum allowed time. If you try to extend the visibility timeout beyond the maximum, your request is rejected.</p> <p>An Amazon SQS message has three basic states:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Sent to a queue by a producer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Received from the queue by a consumer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Deleted from the queue.</p> </li> </ol> <p>A message is considered to be <i>stored</i> after it is sent to a queue by a producer, but not yet received from the queue by a consumer (that is, between states 1 and 2). There is no limit to the number of stored messages. A message is considered to be <i>in flight</i> after it is received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue (that is, between states 2 and 3). There is a limit to the number of inflight messages.</p> <p>Limits that apply to inflight messages are unrelated to the <i>unlimited</i> number of stored messages.</p> <p>For most standard queues (depending on queue traffic and message backlog), there can be a maximum of approximately 120,000 inflight messages (received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue). If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns the <code>OverLimit</code> error message. To avoid reaching the limit, you should delete messages from the queue after they're processed. You can also increase the number of queues you use to process your messages. To request a limit increase, <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&amp;limitType=service-code-sqs">file a support request</a>.</p> <p>For FIFO queues, there can be a maximum of 20,000 inflight messages (received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue). If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns no error messages.</p> <important> <p>If you attempt to set the <code>VisibilityTimeout</code> to a value greater than the maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an error. Amazon SQS doesn't automatically recalculate and increase the timeout to the maximum remaining time.</p> <p>Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility timeout for a specific message the timeout value is applied immediately but isn't saved in memory for that message. If you don't delete a message after it is received, the visibility timeout for the message reverts to the original timeout value (not to the value you set using the <code>ChangeMessageVisibility</code> action) the next time the message is received.</p> </important>

If you try to extend the visibility timeout beyond the maximum, your request is rejected.</p> <p>An Amazon SQS message has three basic states:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Sent to a queue by a producer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Received from the queue by a consumer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Deleted from the queue.</p> </li> </ol> <p>A message is considered to be <i>stored</i> after it is sent to a queue by a producer, but not yet received from the queue by a consumer (that is, between states 1 and 2). There is no limit to the number of stored messages. A message is considered to be <i>in flight</i> after it is received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue (that is, between states 2 and 3). There is a limit to the number of inflight messages.</p> <p>Limits that apply to inflight messages are unrelated to the <i>unlimited</i> number of stored messages.</p> <p>For most standard queues (depending on queue traffic and message backlog), there can be a maximum of approximately 120,000 inflight messages (received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue). If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns the <code>OverLimit</code> error message. To avoid reaching the limit, you should delete messages from the queue after they're processed. You can also increase the number of queues you use to process your messages. To request a limit increase, <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&amp;limitType=service-code-sqs">file a support request</a>.</p> <p>For FIFO queues, there can be a maximum of 20,000 inflight messages (received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue). If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns no error messages.</p> <important> <p>If you attempt to set the <code>VisibilityTimeout</code> to a value greater than the maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an error. Amazon SQS doesn't automatically recalculate and increase the timeout to the maximum remaining time.</p> <p>Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility timeout for a specific message the timeout value is applied immediately but isn't saved in memory for that message. If you don't delete a message after it is received, the visibility timeout for the message reverts to the original timeout value (not to the value you set using the <code>ChangeMessageVisibility</code> action) the next time the message is received.</p> </important>

Valid values: An integer from 0 to 900 (15 minutes). Default: 0. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>MaximumMessageSize</code> – The limit of how many bytes a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. Valid values: An integer from 1,024 bytes (1 KiB) up to 262,144 bytes (256 KiB). Default: 262,144 (256 KiB). </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>MessageRetentionPeriod</code> – The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS retains a message. Valid values: An integer representing seconds, from 60 (1 minute) to 1,209,600 (14 days). Default: 345,600 (4 days). </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Policy</code> – The queue's policy. A valid Amazon Web Services policy. For more information about policy structure, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/PoliciesOverview.html\">Overview of Amazon Web Services IAM Policies</a> in the <i>Identity and Access Management User Guide</i>. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds</code> – The length of time, in seconds, for which a <code> <a>ReceiveMessage</a> </code> action waits for a message to arrive. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 20 (seconds). Default: 0. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>RedrivePolicy</code> – The string that includes the parameters for the dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue as a JSON object. For more information about the redrive policy and dead-letter queues, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html\">Using Amazon SQS Dead-Letter Queues</a> in the <i>Amazon SQS Developer Guide</i>.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>deadLetterTargetArn</code> – The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the value of <code>maxReceiveCount</code> is exceeded.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>maxReceiveCount</code> – The number of times a message is delivered to the source queue before being moved to the dead-letter queue. When the <code>ReceiveCount</code> for a message exceeds the <code>maxReceiveCount</code> for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the dead-letter-queue.</p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>The dead-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue. Similarly, the dead-letter queue of a standard queue must also be a standard queue.</p> </note> </li> <li> <p> <code>VisibilityTimeout</code> – The visibility timeout for the queue, in seconds. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 43,200 (12 hours). Default: 30. For more information about the visibility timeout, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html\">Visibility Timeout</a> in the <i>Amazon SQS Developer Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The following attributes apply only to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html\">server-side-encryption</a>:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>KmsMasterKeyId</code> – The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html#sqs-sse-key-terms\">Key Terms</a>. While the alias of the AWS-managed CMK for Amazon SQS is always <code>alias/aws/sqs</code>, the alias of a custom CMK can, for example, be <code>alias/<i>MyAlias</i> </code>. For more examples, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html#API_DescribeKey_RequestParameters\">KeyId</a> in the <i>Key Management Service API Reference</i>. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds</code> – The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#data-keys\">data key</a> to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling KMS again. An integer representing seconds, between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24 hours). Default: 300 (5 minutes). A shorter time period provides better security but results in more calls to KMS which might incur charges after Free Tier.

Note the following: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Every message must have a unique <code>MessageDeduplicationId</code>.</p> <ul> <li> <p>You may provide a <code>MessageDeduplicationId</code> explicitly.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you aren't able to provide a <code>MessageDeduplicationId</code> and you enable <code>ContentBasedDeduplication</code> for your queue, Amazon SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the <code>MessageDeduplicationId</code> using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message). </p> </li> <li> <p>If you don't provide a <code>MessageDeduplicationId</code> and the queue doesn't have <code>ContentBasedDeduplication</code> set, the action fails with an error.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the queue has <code>ContentBasedDeduplication</code> set, your <code>MessageDeduplicationId</code> overrides the generated one.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>When <code>ContentBasedDeduplication</code> is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you send one message with <code>ContentBasedDeduplication</code> enabled and then another message with a <code>MessageDeduplicationId</code> that is the same as the one generated for the first <code>MessageDeduplicationId</code>, the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered. </p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The following attributes apply only to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/high-throughput-fifo.html\">high throughput for FIFO queues</a>:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>DeduplicationScope</code> – Specifies whether message deduplication occurs at the message group or queue level. Valid values are <code>messageGroup</code> and <code>queue</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>FifoThroughputLimit</code> – Specifies whether the FIFO queue throughput quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid values are <code>perQueue</code> and <code>perMessageGroupId</code>. The <code>perMessageGroupId</code> value is allowed only when the value for <code>DeduplicationScope</code> is <code>messageGroup</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>To enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Set <code>DeduplicationScope</code> to <code>messageGroup</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Set <code>FifoThroughputLimit</code> to <code>perMessageGroupId</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>If you set these attributes to anything other than the values shown for enabling high throughput, normal throughput is in effect and deduplication occurs as specified.</p> <p>For information on throughput quotas, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/quotas-messages.html\">Quotas related to messages</a> in the <i>Amazon SQS Developer Guide</i>.</p>"
