      description: <p> The BatchUpsertTableRows API allows you to upsert one or more rows in a table. The upsert operation takes a filter expression as input and evaluates it to find matching rows on the destination table. If matching rows are found, it will update the cells in the matching rows to new values specified in the request. If no matching rows are found, a new row is added at the end of the table and the cells in that row are set to the new values specified in the request. </p> <p> You can specify the values to set in some or all of the columns in the table for the matching or newly appended rows. If a column is not explicitly specified for a particular row, then that column will not be updated for that row. To clear out the data in a specific cell, you need to set the value as an empty string (""). </p>

However the attribute in the API return value is always a string containing the raw value. </p> <p> Cells with format DATE, DATE_TIME or TIME have the raw value as a floating point number where the whole number represents the number of days since 1/1/1900 and the fractional part represents the fraction of the day since midnight. For example, a cell with date 11/3/2020 has the raw value "44138". A cell with the time 9:00 AM has the raw value "0.375" and a cell with date/time value of 11/3/2020 9:00 AM has the raw value "44138.375". Notice that even though the raw value is a number in all three cases, it is still represented as a string. </p> <p> Cells with format NUMBER, CURRENCY, PERCENTAGE and ACCOUNTING have the raw value of the data as the number representing the data being displayed. For example, the number 1.325 with two decimal places in the format will have it's raw value as "1.325" and formatted value as "1.33". A currency value for $10 will have the raw value as "10" and formatted value as "$10.00". A value representing 20% with two decimal places in the format will have its raw value as "0.2" and the formatted value as "20.00%". An accounting value of -$25 will have "-25" as the raw value and "$ (25.00)" as the formatted value. </p> <p> Cells with format TEXT will have the raw text as the raw value. For example, a cell with text "John Smith" will have "John Smith" as both the raw value and the formatted value. </p> <p> Cells with format CONTACT will have the name of the contact as a formatted value and the email address of the contact as the raw value. For example, a contact for John Smith will have "John Smith" as the formatted value and "john.smith@example.com" as the raw value. </p> <p> Cells with format ROWLINK (aka picklist) will have the first column of the linked row as the formatted value and the row id of the linked row as the raw value. For example, a cell containing a picklist to a table that displays task status might have "Completed" as the formatted value and "row:dfcefaee-5b37-4355-8f28-40c3e4ff5dd4/ca432b2f-b8eb-431d-9fb5-cbe0342f9f03" as the raw value. </p> <p> Cells with format ROWSET (aka multi-select or multi-record picklist) will by default have the first column of each of the linked rows as the formatted value in the list, and the rowset id of the linked rows as the raw value. For example, a cell containing a multi-select picklist to a table that contains items might have "Item A", "Item B" in the formatted value list and "rows:b742c1f4-6cb0-4650-a845-35eb86fcc2bb/ [fdea123b-8f68-474a-aa8a-5ff87aa333af,6daf41f0-a138-4eee-89da-123086d36ecf]" as the raw value. </p> <p> Cells with format ATTACHMENT will have the name of the attachment as the formatted value and the attachment id as the raw value. For example, a cell containing an attachment named "image.jpeg" will have "image.jpeg" as the formatted value and "attachment:ca432b2f-b8eb-431d-9fb5-cbe0342f9f03" as the raw value. </p> <p> Cells with format AUTO or cells without any format that are auto-detected as one of the formats above will contain the raw and formatted values as mentioned above, based on the auto-detected formats. If there is no auto-detected format, the raw and formatted values will be the same as the data in the cell. </p>
