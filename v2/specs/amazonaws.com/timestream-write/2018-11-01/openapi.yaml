  title: Amazon Timestream Write
  description: <fullname>Amazon Timestream Write</fullname> <p>Amazon Timestream is a fast, scalable, fully managed time-series database service that makes it easy to store and analyze trillions of time-series data points per day. With Timestream, you can easily store and analyze IoT sensor data to derive insights from your IoT applications. You can analyze industrial telemetry to streamline equipment management and maintenance. You can also store and analyze log data and metrics to improve the performance and availability of your applications. </p> <p>Timestream is built from the ground up to effectively ingest, process, and store time-series data. It organizes data to optimize query processing. It automatically scales based on the volume of data ingested and on the query volume to ensure you receive optimal performance while inserting and querying data. As your data grows over time, Timestream’s adaptive query processing engine spans across storage tiers to provide fast analysis while reducing costs.</p>

      description: <p>Modifies the retention duration of the memory store and magnetic store for your Timestream table. Note that the change in retention duration takes effect immediately. For example, if the retention period of the memory store was initially set to 2 hours and then changed to 24 hours, the memory store will be capable of holding 24 hours of data, but will be populated with 24 hours of data 22 hours after this change was made. Timestream does not retrieve data from the magnetic store to populate the memory store. </p> <p>See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/code-samples.update-table.html">code sample</a> for details.</p>

      operationId: WriteRecords
      description: <p>Enables you to write your time-series data into Timestream. You can specify a single data point or a batch of data points to be inserted into the system. Timestream offers you a flexible schema that auto detects the column names and data types for your Timestream tables based on the dimension names and data types of the data points you specify when invoking writes into the database. </p> <p>Timestream supports eventual consistency read semantics. This means that when you query data immediately after writing a batch of data into Timestream, the query results might not reflect the results of a recently completed write operation. The results may also include some stale data. If you repeat the query request after a short time, the results should return the latest data. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/ts-limits.html">Service quotas apply</a>. </p> <p>See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/code-samples.write.html">code sample</a> for details.</p> <p> <b>Upserts</b> </p> <p>You can use the <code>Version</code> parameter in a <code>WriteRecords</code> request to update data points. Timestream tracks a version number with each record. <code>Version</code> defaults to <code>1</code> when it's not specified for the record in the request. Timestream updates an existing record’s measure value along with its <code>Version</code> when it receives a write request with a higher <code>Version</code> number for that record. When it receives an update request where the measure value is the same as that of the existing record, Timestream still updates <code>Version</code>, if it is greater than the existing value of <code>Version</code>. You can update a data point as many times as desired, as long as the value of <code>Version</code> continuously increases. </p> <p> For example, suppose you write a new record without indicating <code>Version</code> in the request. Timestream stores this record, and set <code>Version</code> to <code>1</code>. Now, suppose you try to update this record with a <code>WriteRecords</code> request of the same record with a different measure value but, like before, do not provide <code>Version</code>. In this case, Timestream will reject this update with a <code>RejectedRecordsException</code> since the updated record’s version is not greater than the existing value of Version. </p> <p>However, if you were to resend the update request with <code>Version</code> set to <code>2</code>, Timestream would then succeed in updating the record’s value, and the <code>Version</code> would be set to <code>2</code>. Next, suppose you sent a <code>WriteRecords</code> request with this same record and an identical measure value, but with <code>Version</code> set to <code>3</code>. In this case, Timestream would only update <code>Version</code> to <code>3</code>. Any further updates would need to send a version number greater than <code>3</code>, or the update requests would receive a <code>RejectedRecordsException</code>. </p>
