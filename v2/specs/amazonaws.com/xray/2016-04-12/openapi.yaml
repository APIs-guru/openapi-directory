      description: Creates a rule to control sampling behavior for instrumented applications. Services retrieve rules with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_GetSamplingRules.html">GetSamplingRules</a>, and evaluate each rule in ascending order of <i>priority</i> for each request. If a rule matches, the service records a trace, borrowing it from the reservoir size. After 10 seconds, the service reports back to X-Ray with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_GetSamplingTargets.html">GetSamplingTargets</a> to get updated versions of each in-use rule. The updated rule contains a trace quota that the service can use instead of borrowing from the reservoir.

The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/index.html">X-Ray SDK</a> generates segment documents and sends them to the X-Ray daemon, which uploads them in batches. A segment document can be a completed segment, an in-progress segment, or an array of subsegments.</p> <p>Segments must include the following fields. For the full segment document schema, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-api-segmentdocuments.html">Amazon Web Services X-Ray Segment Documents</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services X-Ray Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p class="title"> <b>Required segment document fields</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>name</code> - The name of the service that handled the request.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>id</code> - A 64-bit identifier for the segment, unique among segments in the same trace, in 16 hexadecimal digits.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>trace_id</code> - A unique identifier that connects all segments and subsegments originating from a single client request.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>start_time</code> - Time the segment or subsegment was created, in floating point seconds in epoch time, accurate to milliseconds.

Specify either an <code>end_time</code> or <code>in_progress</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>in_progress</code> - Set to <code>true</code> instead of specifying an <code>end_time</code> to record that a segment has been started, but is not complete. Send an in-progress segment when your application receives a request that will take a long time to serve, to trace that the request was received. When the response is sent, send the complete segment to overwrite the in-progress segment.</p> </li> </ul> <p>A <code>trace_id</code> consists of three numbers separated by hyphens.
