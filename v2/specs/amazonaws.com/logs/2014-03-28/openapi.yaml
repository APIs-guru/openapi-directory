  title: Amazon CloudWatch Logs
  description: '<p>You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your log files from EC2 instances, CloudTrail, and other sources. You can then retrieve the associated log data from CloudWatch Logs using the CloudWatch console. Alternatively, you can use CloudWatch Logs commands in the Amazon Web Services CLI, CloudWatch Logs API, or CloudWatch Logs SDK.</p> <p>You can use CloudWatch Logs to:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Monitor logs from EC2 instances in real time</b>: You can use CloudWatch Logs to monitor applications and systems using log data. For example, CloudWatch Logs can track the number of errors that occur in your application logs. Then, it can send you a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a threshold that you specify. CloudWatch Logs uses your log data for monitoring so no code changes are required. For example, you can monitor application logs for specific literal terms (such as "NullReferenceException"). You can also count the number of occurrences of a literal term at a particular position in log data (such as "404" status codes in an Apache access log). When the term you are searching for is found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data to a CloudWatch metric that you specify.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Monitor CloudTrail logged events</b>: You can create alarms in CloudWatch and receive notifications of particular API activity as captured by CloudTrail. You can use the notification to perform troubleshooting.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Archive log data</b>: You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data in highly durable storage. You can change the log retention setting so that any log events earlier than this setting are automatically deleted. The CloudWatch Logs agent helps to quickly send both rotated and non-rotated log data off of a host and into the log service. You can then access the raw log data when you need it.</p> </li> </ul>'

To prevent unexpected high charges, do not specify high-cardinality fields such as <code>IPAddress</code> or <code>requestID</code> as dimensions. Each different value found for a dimension is treated as a separate metric and accrues charges as a separate custom metric. </p> <p>CloudWatch Logs disables a metric filter if it generates 1,000 different name/value pairs for your specified dimensions within a certain amount of time. This helps to prevent accidental high charges.</p> <p>You can also set up a billing alarm to alert you if your charges are higher than expected.

With a retention policy, you can configure the number of days for which to retain log events in the specified log group.</p> <note> <p>CloudWatch Logs doesn’t immediately delete log events when they reach their retention setting. It typically takes up to 72 hours after that before log events are deleted, but in rare situations might take longer.</p> <p>To illustrate, imagine that you change a log group to have a longer retention setting when it contains log events that are past the expiration date, but haven’t been deleted. Those log events will take up to 72 hours to be deleted after the new retention date is reached. To make sure that log data is deleted permanently, keep a log group at its lower retention setting until 72 hours after the previous retention period ends. Alternatively, wait to change the retention setting until you confirm that the earlier log events are deleted. </p> </note>

To do so, tag your groups and use IAM policies that refer to those tags. To assign tags when you create a log group, you must have either the <code>logs:TagResource</code> or <code>logs:TagLogGroup</code> permission. For more information about tagging, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html">Tagging Amazon Web Services resources</a>. For more information about using tags to control access, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html">Controlling access to Amazon Web Services resources using tags</a>.</p>

Each different value found for a dimension is treated as a separate metric and accrues charges as a separate custom metric. </p> <p>CloudWatch Logs disables a metric filter if it generates 1000 different name/value pairs for your specified dimensions within a certain amount of time. This helps to prevent accidental high charges.</p> <p>You can also set up a billing alarm to alert you if your charges are higher than expected.
