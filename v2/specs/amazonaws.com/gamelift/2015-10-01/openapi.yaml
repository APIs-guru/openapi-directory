      description: "<p>Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit. </p> <p>When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status <code>REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE</code>. This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error.</p> <p>To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players. Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status <code>PLACING</code>, where a new game session is created for the match. </p> <p>If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets where one or more players rejected the match or failed to respond, the ticket status is set to <code>CANCELLED</code>, and processing is terminated. For tickets where players have accepted or not yet responded, the ticket status is returned to <code>SEARCHING</code> to find a new match. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted as needed. </p> <p> <b>Learn more</b> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-client.html\"> Add FlexMatch to a game client</a> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-events.html\"> FlexMatch events</a> (reference)</p>"

      description: <p> <b>This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.</b> </p> <p>Locates an available game server and temporarily reserves it to host gameplay and players. This operation is called from a game client or client service (such as a matchmaker) to request hosting resources for a new game session. In response, Amazon GameLift FleetIQ locates an available game server, places it in <code>CLAIMED</code> status for 60 seconds, and returns connection information that players can use to connect to the game server. </p> <p>To claim a game server, identify a game server group. You can also specify a game server ID, although this approach bypasses Amazon GameLift FleetIQ placement optimization. Optionally, include game data to pass to the game server at the start of a game session, such as a game map or player information. </p> <p>When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is returned. A claimed game server's utilization status remains <code>AVAILABLE</code> while the claim status is set to <code>CLAIMED</code> for up to 60 seconds. This time period gives the game server time to update its status to <code>UTILIZED</code> after players join. If the game server's status is not updated within 60 seconds, the game server reverts to unclaimed status and is available to be claimed by another request. The claim time period is a fixed value and is not configurable.</p> <p>If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in the following cases:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If the game server utilization status is <code>UTILIZED</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the game server claim status is <code>CLAIMED</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>When claiming a specific game server, this request will succeed even if the game server is running on an instance in <code>DRAINING</code> status. To avoid this, first check the instance status by calling <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeGameServerInstances.html">DescribeGameServerInstances</a> .</p> </note> <p> <b>Learn more</b> </p> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-intro.html">Amazon GameLift FleetIQ Guide</a> </p>

      description: '<p>Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of a fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction for a fleet that is useful when redirecting player traffic from one fleet to another, such as when updating your game build. </p> <p>Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site. </p> <p>To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID and an ARN. You can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling <code>UpdateAlias</code>.</p> <p> <b>Related actions</b> </p> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/reference-awssdk.html#reference-awssdk-resources-fleets">All APIs by task</a> </p>'

To use this option, you give Amazon GameLift access to the Amazon S3 bucket. With permissions in place, specify a build name, operating system, and the Amazon S3 storage location of your game build.</p> </li> <li> <p>To directly upload your build files to a Amazon GameLift Amazon S3 location. To use this option, specify a build name and operating system. This operation creates a new build resource and also returns an Amazon S3 location with temporary access credentials. Use the credentials to manually upload your build files to the specified Amazon S3 location. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UploadingObjects.html\">Uploading Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 Developer Guide</i>. After you upload build files to the Amazon GameLift Amazon S3 location, you can't update them. </p> </li> </ul> <p>If successful, this operation creates a new build resource with a unique build ID and places it in <code>INITIALIZED</code> status.

Use this operation to configure the computing resources for your fleet and provide instructions for running game servers on each instance.</p> <p>Most Amazon GameLift fleets can deploy instances to multiple locations, including the home Region (where the fleet is created) and an optional set of remote locations. Fleets that are created in the following Amazon Web Services Regions support multiple locations: us-east-1 (N. Virginia), us-west-2 (Oregon), eu-central-1 (Frankfurt), eu-west-1 (Ireland), ap-southeast-2 (Sydney), ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo), and ap-northeast-2 (Seoul). Fleets that are created in other Amazon GameLift Regions can deploy instances in the fleet's home Region only. All fleet instances use the same configuration regardless of location; however, you can adjust capacity settings and turn auto-scaling on/off for each location.</p> <p>To create a fleet, choose the hardware for your instances, specify a game server build or Realtime script to deploy, and provide a runtime configuration to direct Amazon GameLift how to start and run game servers on each instance in the fleet. Set permissions for inbound traffic to your game servers, and enable optional features as needed. When creating a multi-location fleet, provide a list of additional remote locations.</p> <p>If you need to debug your fleet, fetch logs, view performance metrics or other actions on the fleet, create the development fleet with port 22/3389 open. As a best practice, we recommend opening ports for remote access only when you need them and closing them when you're finished. </p> <p>If successful, this operation creates a new Fleet resource and places it in <code>NEW</code> status, which prompts Amazon GameLift to initiate the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-creating-all.html#fleets-creation-workflow\">fleet creation workflow</a>.</p> <p> <b>Learn more</b> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-intro.html\">Setting up fleets</a> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-creating-debug.html#fleets-creating-debug-creation\">Debug fleet creation issues</a> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-intro.html\">Multi-location fleets</a> </p>"

This operation creates the game server group, creates an Auto Scaling group in your Amazon Web Services account, and establishes a link between the two groups. You can view the status of your game server groups in the Amazon GameLift console. Game server group metrics and events are emitted to Amazon CloudWatch.</p> <p>Before creating a new game server group, you must have the following: </p> <ul> <li> <p>An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud launch template that specifies how to launch Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances with your game server build. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html\"> Launching an Instance from a Launch Template</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>. </p> </li> <li> <p>An IAM role that extends limited access to your Amazon Web Services account to allow Amazon GameLift FleetIQ to create and interact with the Auto Scaling group.

You must also set initial maximum and minimum limits on the group's instance count. You can optionally set an Auto Scaling policy with target tracking based on a Amazon GameLift FleetIQ metric.</p> <p>Once the game server group and corresponding Auto Scaling group are created, you have full access to change the Auto Scaling group's configuration as needed. Several properties that are set when creating a game server group, including maximum/minimum size and auto-scaling policy settings, must be updated directly in the Auto Scaling group. Keep in mind that some Auto Scaling group properties are periodically updated by Amazon GameLift FleetIQ as part of its balancing activities to optimize for availability and cost.</p> <p> <b>Learn more</b> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-intro.html\">Amazon GameLift FleetIQ Guide</a> </p>"

      description: <p>Creates a placement queue that processes requests for new game sessions. A queue uses FleetIQ algorithms to determine the best placement locations and find an available game server there, then prompts the game server process to start a new game session. </p> <p>A game session queue is configured with a set of destinations (Amazon GameLift fleets or aliases), which determine the locations where the queue can place new game sessions. These destinations can span multiple fleet types (Spot and On-Demand), instance types, and Amazon Web Services Regions. If the queue includes multi-location fleets, the queue is able to place game sessions in all of a fleet's remote locations. You can opt to filter out individual locations if needed.</p> <p>The queue configuration also determines how FleetIQ selects the best available placement for a new game session. Before searching for an available game server, FleetIQ first prioritizes the queue's destinations and locations, with the best placement locations on top. You can set up the queue to use the FleetIQ default prioritization or provide an alternate set of priorities.</p> <p>To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, and a list of destinations. Optionally, specify a sort configuration and/or a filter, and define a set of latency cap policies. You can also include the ARN for an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic to receive notifications of game session placement activity. Notifications using SNS or CloudWatch events is the preferred way to track placement activity.</p> <p>If successful, a new <code>GameSessionQueue</code> object is returned with an assigned queue ARN.

Optionally, provide a set of player data for each player ID. </p> <p>If successful, a slot is reserved in the game session for each player, and new <code>PlayerSession</code> objects are returned with player session IDs. Each player references their player session ID when sending a connection request to the game session, and the game server can use it to validate the player reservation with the Amazon GameLift service. Player sessions cannot be updated.</p> <p>The maximum number of players per game session is 200. It is not adjustable. </p> <p> <b>Related actions</b> </p> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/reference-awssdk.html#reference-awssdk-resources-fleets">All APIs by task</a> </p>

You have several options for how these resources are impacted when deleting the game server group. Depending on the type of delete operation selected, this operation might affect these resources:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The game server group</p> </li> <li> <p>The corresponding Auto Scaling group</p> </li> <li> <p>All game servers that are currently running in the group</p> </li> </ul> <p>To delete a game server group, identify the game server group to delete and specify the type of delete operation to initiate. Game server groups can only be deleted if they are in <code>ACTIVE</code> or <code>ERROR</code> status.</p> <p>If the delete request is successful, a series of operations are kicked off. The game server group status is changed to <code>DELETE_SCHEDULED</code>, which prevents new game servers from being registered and stops automatic scaling activity. Once all game servers in the game server group are deregistered, Amazon GameLift FleetIQ can begin deleting resources. If any of the delete operations fail, the game server group is placed in <code>ERROR</code> status.</p> <p>Amazon GameLift FleetIQ emits delete events to Amazon CloudWatch.</p> <p> <b>Learn more</b> </p> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-intro.html">Amazon GameLift FleetIQ Guide</a> </p>

Instance limits control the number of instances, per instance type, per location, that your Amazon Web Services account can use. Learn more at <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/\">Amazon EC2 Instance Types</a>. The information returned includes the maximum number of instances allowed and your account's current usage across all fleets. This information can affect your ability to scale your Amazon GameLift fleets. You can request a limit increase for your account by using the <b>Service limits</b> page in the Amazon GameLift console.</p> <p>Instance limits differ based on whether the instances are deployed in a fleet's home Region or in a remote location. For remote locations, limits also differ based on the combination of home Region and remote location. All requests must specify an Amazon Web Services Region (either explicitly or as your default settings). To get the limit for a remote location, you must also specify the location. For example, the following requests all return different results: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Request specifies the Region <code>ap-northeast-1</code> with no location. The result is limits and usage data on all instance types that are deployed in <code>us-east-2</code>, by all of the fleets that reside in <code>ap-northeast-1</code>. </p> </li> <li> <p>Request specifies the Region <code>us-east-1</code> with location <code>ca-central-1</code>. The result is limits and usage data on all instance types that are deployed in <code>ca-central-1</code>, by all of the fleets that reside in <code>us-east-2</code>. These limits do not affect fleets in any other Regions that deploy instances to <code>ca-central-1</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Request specifies the Region <code>eu-west-1</code> with location <code>ca-central-1</code>. The result is limits and usage data on all instance types that are deployed in <code>ca-central-1</code>, by all of the fleets that reside in <code>eu-west-1</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This operation can be used in the following ways:</p> <ul> <li> <p>To get limit and usage data for all instance types that are deployed in an Amazon Web Services Region by fleets that reside in the same Region: Specify the Region only.

      description: <p>Requests remote access to a fleet instance. Remote access is useful for debugging, gathering benchmarking data, or observing activity in real time. </p> <p>To remotely access an instance, you need credentials that match the operating system of the instance. For a Windows instance, Amazon GameLift returns a user name and password as strings for use with a Windows Remote Desktop client. For a Linux instance, Amazon GameLift returns a user name and RSA private key, also as strings, for use with an SSH client. The private key must be saved in the proper format to a <code>.pem</code> file before using. If you're making this request using the CLI, saving the secret can be handled as part of the <code>GetInstanceAccess</code> request, as shown in one of the examples for this operation. </p> <p>To request access to a specific instance, specify the IDs of both the instance and the fleet it belongs to.

    post:
      operationId: PutScalingPolicy
      description: "<p>Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling. </p> <p>Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences.</p> <p>Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html\">Set Up Fleet Automatic Scaling</a>.</p> <p> <b>Target-based policy</b> </p> <p>A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target. </p> <p>For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer. </p> <p>To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to \"TargetBased\". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a <code>TargetConfiguration</code> object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.</p> <p> <b>Rule-based policy</b> </p> <p>A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action. </p> <p>For example, a policy may make the following statement: \"If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%.\"</p> <p>A policy's rule statement has the following structure:</p> <p>If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code> <code>[Threshold]</code> for <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes, then <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code> to/by <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>.</p> <p>To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:</p> <p>If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code> <code>[20]</code> for <code>[15]</code> minutes, then <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code> to/by <code>[10]</code>.</p> <p>To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to \"RuleBased\". Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.</p>"

This practice can cause you to exceed your API limit, which results in errors.

Continuously polling game session status with <code>DescribeGameSessions</code> should only be used for games in development with low game session usage. </p> <p>When searching for game sessions, you specify exactly where you want to search and provide a search filter expression, a sort expression, or both. A search request can search only one fleet, but it can search all of a fleet's locations. </p> <p>This operation can be used in the following ways: </p> <ul> <li> <p>To search all game sessions that are currently running on all locations in a fleet, provide a fleet or alias ID. This approach returns game sessions in the fleet's home Region and all remote locations that fit the search criteria.</p> </li> <li> <p>To search all game sessions that are currently running on a specific fleet location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name.

To retrieve information on game sessions in other statuses, use <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeGameSessions.html\">DescribeGameSessions</a> .</p> <p>You can search or sort by the following game session attributes:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>gameSessionId</b> -- A unique identifier for the game session. You can use either a <code>GameSessionId</code> or <code>GameSessionArn</code> value. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>gameSessionName</b> -- Name assigned to a game session. Game session names do not need to be unique to a game session.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>gameSessionProperties</b> -- Custom data defined in a game session's <code>GameProperty</code> parameter. <code>GameProperty</code> values are stored as key:value pairs; the filter expression must indicate the key and a string to search the data values for. For example, to search for game sessions with custom data containing the key:value pair \"gameMode:brawl\", specify the following: <code>gameSessionProperties.gameMode = \"brawl\"</code>. All custom data values are searched as strings.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>maximumSessions</b> -- Maximum number of player sessions allowed for a game session.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>creationTimeMillis</b> -- Value indicating when a game session was created.

When processing a placement request, Amazon GameLift searches for available resources on the queue's destinations, scanning each until it finds resources or the placement request times out.</p> <p>A game session placement request can also request player sessions. When a new game session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift creates a player session for each player included in the request.</p> <p>When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each fleet in the order they are listed in the queue configuration. Ideally, a queue's destinations are listed in preference order.</p> <p>Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also provide latency data for each player in relevant Regions. Latency data indicates the performance lag a player experiences when connected to a fleet in the Region. Amazon GameLift uses latency data to reorder the list of destinations to place the game session in a Region with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift calculates each Region's average lag for all players and reorders to get the best game play across all players. </p> <p>To place a new game session request, specify the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The queue name and a set of game session properties and settings</p> </li> <li> <p>A unique ID (such as a UUID) for the placement. You use this ID to track the status of the placement request</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) A set of player data and a unique player ID for each player that you are joining to the new game session (player data is optional, but if you include it, you must also provide a unique ID for each player)</p> </li> <li> <p>Latency data for all players (if you want to optimize game play for the players)</p> </li> </ul> <p>If successful, a new game session placement is created.</p> <p>To track the status of a placement request, call <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeGameSessionPlacement.html">DescribeGameSessionPlacement</a> and check the request's status.

      description: <p>Finds new players to fill open slots in currently running game sessions. The backfill match process is essentially identical to the process of forming new matches. Backfill requests use the same matchmaker that was used to make the original match, and they provide matchmaking data for all players currently in the game session. FlexMatch uses this information to select new players so that backfilled match continues to meet the original match requirements. </p> <p>When using FlexMatch with Amazon GameLift managed hosting, you can request a backfill match from a client service by calling this operation with a <code>GameSessions</code> ID. You also have the option of making backfill requests directly from your game server. In response to a request, FlexMatch creates player sessions for the new players, updates the <code>GameSession</code> resource, and sends updated matchmaking data to the game server. You can request a backfill match at any point after a game session is started. Each game session can have only one active backfill request at a time; a subsequent request automatically replaces the earlier request.</p> <p>When using FlexMatch as a standalone component, request a backfill match by calling this operation without a game session identifier. As with newly formed matches, matchmaking results are returned in a matchmaking event so that your game can update the game session that is being backfilled.</p> <p>To request a backfill match, specify a unique ticket ID, the original matchmaking configuration, and matchmaking data for all current players in the game session being backfilled. Optionally, specify the <code>GameSession</code> ARN. If successful, a match backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. Track the status of backfill tickets using the same method for tracking tickets for new matches.</p> <p>Only game sessions created by FlexMatch are supported for match backfill.</p> <p> <b>Learn more</b> </p> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-backfill.html"> Backfill existing games with FlexMatch</a> </p> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-events.html"> Matchmaking events</a> (reference)</p> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/gamelift-match.html"> How Amazon GameLift FlexMatch works</a> </p>

You can restart activity by calling <a href="gamelift/latest/apireference/API_ResumeGameServerGroup.html">ResumeGameServerGroup</a>. You can suspend the following activity:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Instance type replacement</b> - This activity evaluates the current game hosting viability of all Spot instance types that are defined for the game server group. It updates the Auto Scaling group to remove nonviable Spot Instance types, which have a higher chance of game server interruptions. It then balances capacity across the remaining viable Spot Instance types. When this activity is suspended, the Auto Scaling group continues with its current balance, regardless of viability. Instance protection, utilization metrics, and capacity scaling activities continue to be active. </p> </li> </ul> <p>To suspend activity, specify a game server group ARN and the type of activity to be suspended. If successful, a <code>GameServerGroup</code> object is returned showing that the activity is listed in <code>SuspendedActions</code>.</p> <p> <b>Learn more</b> </p> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-intro.html">Amazon GameLift FleetIQ Guide</a> </p>

Fleet capacity determines the number of game sessions and players that can be hosted based on the fleet configuration. Use this operation to set the following fleet capacity properties: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Minimum/maximum size: Set hard limits on fleet capacity. Amazon GameLift cannot set the fleet's capacity to a value outside of this range, whether the capacity is changed manually or through automatic scaling. </p> </li> <li> <p>Desired capacity: Manually set the number of Amazon EC2 instances to be maintained in a fleet location. Before changing a fleet's desired capacity, you may want to call <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeEC2InstanceLimits.html\">DescribeEC2InstanceLimits</a> to get the maximum capacity of the fleet's Amazon EC2 instance type. Alternatively, consider using automatic scaling to adjust capacity based on player demand.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This operation can be used in the following ways: </p> <ul> <li> <p>To update capacity for a fleet's home Region, or if the fleet has no remote locations, omit the <code>Location</code> parameter. The fleet must be in <code>ACTIVE</code> status. </p> </li> <li> <p>To update capacity for a fleet's remote location, include the <code>Location</code> parameter set to the location to be updated. The location must be in <code>ACTIVE</code> status.</p> </li> </ul> <p>If successful, capacity settings are updated immediately. In response a change in desired capacity, Amazon GameLift initiates steps to start new instances or terminate existing instances in the requested fleet location. This continues until the location's active instance count matches the new desired instance count. You can track a fleet's current capacity by calling <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeFleetCapacity.html\">DescribeFleetCapacity</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeFleetLocationCapacity.html\">DescribeFleetLocationCapacity</a>. If the requested desired instance count is higher than the instance type's limit, the <code>LimitExceeded</code> exception occurs.</p> <p> <b>Learn more</b> </p> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-manage-capacity.html\">Scaling fleet capacity</a> </p>"

You can make all three types of updates in the same request:</p> <ul> <li> <p>To update the game server's utilization status, identify the game server and game server group and specify the current utilization status.

If a game server does not report health status for a certain length of time, the game server is no longer considered healthy. As a result, it will be eventually deregistered from the game server group to avoid affecting utilization metrics. The best practice is to report health every 60 seconds.</p> </li> <li> <p>To change game server metadata, provide updated game server data.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Once a game server is successfully updated, the relevant statuses and timestamps are updated.</p> <p> <b>Learn more</b> </p> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-intro.html">Amazon GameLift FleetIQ Guide</a> </p>
