  title: Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service
  description: <p>Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services without needing to stand up or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. </p> <p>Amazon EKS runs up-to-date versions of the open-source Kubernetes software, so you can use all the existing plugins and tooling from the Kubernetes community. Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications running on any standard Kubernetes environment, whether running in on-premises data centers or public clouds. This means that you can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS without any code modification required.</p>

After configuring authentication to your cluster you can create Kubernetes <code>roles</code> and <code>clusterroles</code> to assign permissions to the roles, and then bind the roles to the identities using Kubernetes <code>rolebindings</code> and <code>clusterrolebindings</code>.

      description: <p>Creates an Fargate profile for your Amazon EKS cluster. You must have at least one Fargate profile in a cluster to be able to run pods on Fargate.</p> <p>The Fargate profile allows an administrator to declare which pods run on Fargate and specify which pods run on which Fargate profile. This declaration is done through the profile’s selectors. Each profile can have up to five selectors that contain a namespace and labels. A namespace is required for every selector. The label field consists of multiple optional key-value pairs. Pods that match the selectors are scheduled on Fargate. If a to-be-scheduled pod matches any of the selectors in the Fargate profile, then that pod is run on Fargate.</p> <p>When you create a Fargate profile, you must specify a pod execution role to use with the pods that are scheduled with the profile. This role is added to the cluster's Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/">Role Based Access Control</a> (RBAC) for authorization so that the <code>kubelet</code> that is running on the Fargate infrastructure can register with your Amazon EKS cluster so that it can appear in your cluster as a node. The pod execution role also provides IAM permissions to the Fargate infrastructure to allow read access to Amazon ECR image repositories. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-execution-role.html">Pod Execution Role</a> in the <i>Amazon EKS User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Fargate profiles are immutable. However, you can create a new updated profile to replace an existing profile and then delete the original after the updated profile has finished creating.</p> <p>If any Fargate profiles in a cluster are in the <code>DELETING</code> status, you must wait for that Fargate profile to finish deleting before you can create any other profiles in that cluster.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate-profile.html">Fargate Profile</a> in the <i>Amazon EKS User Guide</i>.</p>

      description: Associates the specified tags to a resource with the specified <code>resourceArn</code>. If existing tags on a resource are not specified in the request parameters, they are not changed. When a resource is deleted, the tags associated with that resource are deleted as well. Tags that you create for Amazon EKS resources do not propagate to any other resources associated with the cluster. For example, if you tag a cluster with this operation, that tag does not automatically propagate to the subnets and nodes associated with the cluster.

      operationId: UpdateNodegroupVersion
      description: <p>Updates the Kubernetes version or AMI version of an Amazon EKS managed node group.</p> <p>You can update a node group using a launch template only if the node group was originally deployed with a launch template. If you need to update a custom AMI in a node group that was deployed with a launch template, then update your custom AMI, specify the new ID in a new version of the launch template, and then update the node group to the new version of the launch template.</p> <p>If you update without a launch template, then you can update to the latest available AMI version of a node group's current Kubernetes version by not specifying a Kubernetes version in the request. You can update to the latest AMI version of your cluster's current Kubernetes version by specifying your cluster's Kubernetes version in the request. For information about Linux versions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-linux-ami-versions.html">Amazon EKS optimized Amazon Linux AMI versions</a> in the <i>Amazon EKS User Guide</i>. For information about Windows versions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-ami-versions-windows.html">Amazon EKS optimized Windows AMI versions</a> in the <i>Amazon EKS User Guide</i>. </p> <p>You cannot roll back a node group to an earlier Kubernetes version or AMI version.</p> <p>When a node in a managed node group is terminated due to a scaling action or update, the pods in that node are drained first. Amazon EKS attempts to drain the nodes gracefully and will fail if it is unable to do so. You can <code>force</code> the update if Amazon EKS is unable to drain the nodes as a result of a pod disruption budget issue.</p>
