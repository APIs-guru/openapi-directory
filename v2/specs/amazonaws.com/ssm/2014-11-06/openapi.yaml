    post:
      operationId: AddTagsToResource
      description: <p>Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified resource. <i>Tags</i> are metadata that you can assign to your automations, documents, managed nodes, maintenance windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for your account's managed nodes that helps you track each node's owner and stack level. For example:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>Key=Owner,Value=DbAdmin</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Key=Owner,Value=SysAdmin</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Key=Owner,Value=Dev</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Key=Stack,Value=Production</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Key=Stack,Value=Pre-Production</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Key=Stack,Value=Test</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>Most resources can have a maximum of 50 tags. Automations can have a maximum of 5 tags.</p> <p>We recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for each resource type. Using a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for you to manage your resources. You can search and filter the resources based on the tags you add. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to and are interpreted strictly as a string of characters.</p> <p>For more information about using tags with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html">Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p>

For example, an association can specify that anti-virus software must be installed and running on your managed nodes, or that certain ports must be closed. For static targets, the association specifies a schedule for when the configuration is reapplied. For dynamic targets, such as an Amazon Web Services resource group or an Amazon Web Services autoscaling group, State Manager, a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager applies the configuration when new managed nodes are added to the group. The association also specifies actions to take when applying the configuration. For example, an association for anti-virus software might run once a day. If the software isn't installed, then State Manager installs it. If the software is installed, but the service isn't running, then the association might instruct State Manager to start the service. "

      description: <p> <code>ServiceSetting</code> is an account-level setting for an Amazon Web Services service. This setting defines how a user interacts with or uses a service or a feature of a service. For example, if an Amazon Web Services service charges money to the account based on feature or service usage, then the Amazon Web Services service team might create a default setting of <code>false</code>. This means the user can't use this feature unless they change the setting to <code>true</code> and intentionally opt in for a paid feature.</p> <p>Services map a <code>SettingId</code> object to a setting value. Amazon Web Services services teams define the default value for a <code>SettingId</code>. You can't create a new <code>SettingId</code>, but you can overwrite the default value if you have the <code>ssm:UpdateServiceSetting</code> permission for the setting. Use the <a>UpdateServiceSetting</a> API operation to change the default setting. Or use the <a>ResetServiceSetting</a> to change the value back to the original value defined by the Amazon Web Services service team.</p> <p>Query the current service setting for the Amazon Web Services account. </p>

This setting defines how a user interacts with or uses a service or a feature of a service. For example, if an Amazon Web Services service charges money to the account based on feature or service usage, then the Amazon Web Services service team might create a default setting of "false". This means the user can't use this feature unless they change the setting to "true" and intentionally opt in for a paid feature.</p> <p>Services map a <code>SettingId</code> object to a setting value. Amazon Web Services services teams define the default value for a <code>SettingId</code>. You can't create a new <code>SettingId</code>, but you can overwrite the default value if you have the <code>ssm:UpdateServiceSetting</code> permission for the setting. Use the <a>GetServiceSetting</a> API operation to view the current value. Use the <a>UpdateServiceSetting</a> API operation to change the default setting. </p> <p>Reset the service setting for the account to the default value as provisioned by the Amazon Web Services service team. </p>

Standard parameters have a content size limit of 4 KB and can't be configured to use parameter policies. You can create a maximum of 10,000 standard parameters for each Region in an Amazon Web Services account. Standard parameters are offered at no additional cost. </p> <p>Advanced parameters have a content size limit of 8 KB and can be configured to use parameter policies. You can create a maximum of 100,000 advanced parameters for each Region in an Amazon Web Services account. Advanced parameters incur a charge. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-store-advanced-parameters.html\">Standard and advanced parameter tiers</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can change a standard parameter to an advanced parameter any time. But you can't revert an advanced parameter to a standard parameter. Reverting an advanced parameter to a standard parameter would result in data loss because the system would truncate the size of the parameter from 8 KB to 4 KB. Reverting would also remove any policies attached to the parameter. Lastly, advanced parameters use a different form of encryption than standard parameters. </p> <p>If you no longer need an advanced parameter, or if you no longer want to incur charges for an advanced parameter, you must delete it and recreate it as a new standard parameter. </p> <p> <b>Using the Default Tier Configuration</b> </p> <p>In <code>PutParameter</code> requests, you can specify the tier to create the parameter in. Whenever you specify a tier in the request, Parameter Store creates or updates the parameter according to that request. However, if you don't specify a tier in a request, Parameter Store assigns the tier based on the current Parameter Store default tier configuration.</p> <p>The default tier when you begin using Parameter Store is the standard-parameter tier. If you use the advanced-parameter tier, you can specify one of the following as the default:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Advanced</b>: With this option, Parameter Store evaluates all requests as advanced parameters. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Intelligent-Tiering</b>: With this option, Parameter Store evaluates each request to determine if the parameter is standard or advanced. </p> <p>If the request doesn't include any options that require an advanced parameter, the parameter is created in the standard-parameter tier. If one or more options requiring an advanced parameter are included in the request, Parameter Store create a parameter in the advanced-parameter tier.</p> <p>This approach helps control your parameter-related costs by always creating standard parameters unless an advanced parameter is necessary. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Options that require an advanced parameter include the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The content size of the parameter is more than 4 KB.</p> </li> <li> <p>The parameter uses a parameter policy.</p> </li> <li> <p>More than 10,000 parameters already exist in your Amazon Web Services account in the current Amazon Web Services Region.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about configuring the default tier option, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ps-default-tier.html\">Specifying a default parameter tier</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide</i>.</p>"

      description: '<p>One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list of documents.</p> <p>For keys, you can specify one or more tags that have been applied to a document. </p> <p>You can also use Amazon Web Services-provided keys, some of which have specific allowed values. These keys and their associated values are as follows:</p> <dl> <dt>DocumentType</dt> <dd> <ul> <li> <p> <code>ApplicationConfiguration</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ApplicationConfigurationSchema</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Automation</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ChangeCalendar</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Command</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Package</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Policy</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Session</code> </p> </li> </ul> </dd> <dt>Owner</dt> <dd> <p>Note that only one <code>Owner</code> can be specified in a request.

If you use <code>Name</code> as a key, you can use a name prefix to return a list of documents. For example, in the Amazon Web Services CLI, to return a list of all documents that begin with <code>Te</code>, run the following command:</p> <p> <code>aws ssm list-documents --filters Key=Name,Values=Te</code> </p> <p>You can also use the <code>TargetType</code> Amazon Web Services-provided key. For a list of valid resource type values that can be used with this key, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html">Amazon Web Services resource and property types reference</a> in the <i>CloudFormation User Guide</i>.</p> <p>If you specify more than two keys, only documents that are identified by all the tags are returned in the results. If you specify more than two values for a key, documents that are identified by any of the values are returned in the results.</p> <p>To specify a custom key-value pair, use the format <code>Key=tag:tagName,Values=valueName</code>.</p> <p>For example, if you created a key called region and are using the Amazon Web Services CLI to call the <code>list-documents</code> command: </p> <p> <code>aws ssm list-documents --filters Key=tag:region,Values=east,west Key=Owner,Values=Self</code> </p>'

      description: <p>Operations engineers and IT professionals use Amazon Web Services Systems Manager OpsCenter to view, investigate, and remediate operational work items (OpsItems) impacting the performance and health of their Amazon Web Services resources. OpsCenter is integrated with Amazon EventBridge and Amazon CloudWatch. This means you can configure these services to automatically create an OpsItem in OpsCenter when a CloudWatch alarm enters the ALARM state or when EventBridge processes an event from any Amazon Web Services service that publishes events. Configuring Amazon CloudWatch alarms and EventBridge events to automatically create OpsItems allows you to quickly diagnose and remediate issues with Amazon Web Services resources from a single console.</p> <p>To help you diagnose issues, each OpsItem includes contextually relevant information such as the name and ID of the Amazon Web Services resource that generated the OpsItem, alarm or event details, alarm history, and an alarm timeline graph. For the Amazon Web Services resource, OpsCenter aggregates information from Config, CloudTrail logs, and EventBridge, so you don't have to navigate across multiple console pages during your investigation.

      description: <p>The service setting data structure.</p> <p> <code>ServiceSetting</code> is an account-level setting for an Amazon Web Services service. This setting defines how a user interacts with or uses a service or a feature of a service. For example, if an Amazon Web Services service charges money to the account based on feature or service usage, then the Amazon Web Services service team might create a default setting of "false". This means the user can't use this feature unless they change the setting to "true" and intentionally opt in for a paid feature.</p> <p>Services map a <code>SettingId</code> object to a setting value. Amazon Web Services services teams define the default value for a <code>SettingId</code>. You can't create a new <code>SettingId</code>, but you can overwrite the default value if you have the <code>ssm:UpdateServiceSetting</code> permission for the setting. Use the <a>UpdateServiceSetting</a> API operation to change the default setting. Or, use the <a>ResetServiceSetting</a> to change the value back to the original value defined by the Amazon Web Services service team.</p>
