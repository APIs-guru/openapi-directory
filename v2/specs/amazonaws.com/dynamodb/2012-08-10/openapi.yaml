  title: Amazon DynamoDB
  description: <fullname>Amazon DynamoDB</fullname> <p>Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed database, so that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling.</p> <p>With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. You can scale up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance degradation, and use the Amazon Web Services Management Console to monitor resource utilization and performance metrics.</p> <p>DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for your tables over a sufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and storage requirements, while maintaining consistent and fast performance. All of your data is stored on solid state disks (SSDs) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an Amazon Web Services Region, providing built-in high availability and data durability.</p>

      description: <p>The <code>BatchGetItem</code> operation returns the attributes of one or more items from one or more tables. You identify requested items by primary key.</p> <p>A single operation can retrieve up to 16 MB of data, which can contain as many as 100 items. <code>BatchGetItem</code> returns a partial result if the response size limit is exceeded, the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded, or an internal processing failure occurs. If a partial result is returned, the operation returns a value for <code>UnprocessedKeys</code>. You can use this value to retry the operation starting with the next item to get.</p> <important> <p>If you request more than 100 items, <code>BatchGetItem</code> returns a <code>ValidationException</code> with the message "Too many items requested for the BatchGetItem call."</p> </important> <p>For example, if you ask to retrieve 100 items, but each individual item is 300 KB in size, the system returns 52 items (so as not to exceed the 16 MB limit). It also returns an appropriate <code>UnprocessedKeys</code> value so you can get the next page of results. If desired, your application can include its own logic to assemble the pages of results into one dataset.</p> <p>If <i>none</i> of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then <code>BatchGetItem</code> returns a <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. If <i>at least one</i> of the items is successfully processed, then <code>BatchGetItem</code> completes successfully, while returning the keys of the unread items in <code>UnprocessedKeys</code>.</p> <important> <p>If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items. However, <i>we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm</i>. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ErrorHandling.html#BatchOperations">Batch Operations and Error Handling</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>.</p> </important> <p>By default, <code>BatchGetItem</code> performs eventually consistent reads on every table in the request. If you want strongly consistent reads instead, you can set <code>ConsistentRead</code> to <code>true</code> for any or all tables.</p> <p>In order to minimize response latency, <code>BatchGetItem</code> may retrieve items in parallel.</p> <p>When designing your application, keep in mind that DynamoDB does not return items in any particular order. To help parse the response by item, include the primary key values for the items in your request in the <code>ProjectionExpression</code> parameter.</p> <p>If a requested item does not exist, it is not returned in the result. Requests for nonexistent items consume the minimum read capacity units according to the type of read.

      description: <p>The <code>BatchWriteItem</code> operation puts or deletes multiple items in one or more tables. A single call to <code>BatchWriteItem</code> can transmit up to 16MB of data over the network, consisting of up to 25 item put or delete operations. While individual items can be up to 400 KB once stored, it's important to note that an item's representation might be greater than 400KB while being sent in DynamoDB's JSON format for the API call. For more details on this distinction, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.NamingRulesDataTypes.html">Naming Rules and Data Types</a>.</p> <note> <p> <code>BatchWriteItem</code> cannot update items. If you perform a <code>BatchWriteItem</code> operation on an existing item, that item's values will be overwritten by the operation and it will appear like it was updated. To update items, we recommend you use the <code>UpdateItem</code> action.</p> </note> <p>The individual <code>PutItem</code> and <code>DeleteItem</code> operations specified in <code>BatchWriteItem</code> are atomic; however <code>BatchWriteItem</code> as a whole is not. If any requested operations fail because the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded or an internal processing failure occurs, the failed operations are returned in the <code>UnprocessedItems</code> response parameter. You can investigate and optionally resend the requests. Typically, you would call <code>BatchWriteItem</code> in a loop. Each iteration would check for unprocessed items and submit a new <code>BatchWriteItem</code> request with those unprocessed items until all items have been processed.</p> <p>If <i>none</i> of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then <code>BatchWriteItem</code> returns a <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>.</p> <important> <p>If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items. However, <i>we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm</i>. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ErrorHandling.html#Programming.Errors.BatchOperations">Batch Operations and Error Handling</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>.</p> </important> <p>With <code>BatchWriteItem</code>, you can efficiently write or delete large amounts of data, such as from Amazon EMR, or copy data from another database into DynamoDB. In order to improve performance with these large-scale operations, <code>BatchWriteItem</code> does not behave in the same way as individual <code>PutItem</code> and <code>DeleteItem</code> calls would. For example, you cannot specify conditions on individual put and delete requests, and <code>BatchWriteItem</code> does not return deleted items in the response.</p> <p>If you use a programming language that supports concurrency, you can use threads to write items in parallel. Your application must include the necessary logic to manage the threads. With languages that don't support threading, you must update or delete the specified items one at a time. In both situations, <code>BatchWriteItem</code> performs the specified put and delete operations in parallel, giving you the power of the thread pool approach without having to introduce complexity into your application.</p> <p>Parallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put and delete request consumes the same number of write capacity units whether it is processed in parallel or not. Delete operations on nonexistent items consume one write capacity unit.</p> <p>If one or more of the following is true, DynamoDB rejects the entire batch write operation:</p> <ul> <li> <p>One or more tables specified in the <code>BatchWriteItem</code> request does not exist.</p> </li> <li> <p>Primary key attributes specified on an item in the request do not match those in the corresponding table's primary key schema.</p> </li> <li> <p>You try to perform multiple operations on the same item in the same <code>BatchWriteItem</code> request. For example, you cannot put and delete the same item in the same <code>BatchWriteItem</code> request. </p> </li> <li> <p> Your request contains at least two items with identical hash and range keys (which essentially is two put operations). </p> </li> <li> <p>There are more than 25 requests in the batch.</p> </li> <li> <p>Any individual item in a batch exceeds 400 KB.</p> </li> <li> <p>The total request size exceeds 16 MB.</p> </li> </ul>

      description: <p>Returns the current provisioned-capacity quotas for your Amazon Web Services account in a Region, both for the Region as a whole and for any one DynamoDB table that you create there.</p> <p>When you establish an Amazon Web Services account, the account has initial quotas on the maximum read capacity units and write capacity units that you can provision across all of your DynamoDB tables in a given Region. Also, there are per-table quotas that apply when you create a table there. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Limits.html">Service, Account, and Table Quotas</a> page in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>Although you can increase these quotas by filing a case at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/">Amazon Web Services Support Center</a>, obtaining the increase is not instantaneous. The <code>DescribeLimits</code> action lets you write code to compare the capacity you are currently using to those quotas imposed by your account so that you have enough time to apply for an increase before you hit a quota.</p> <p>For example, you could use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to do the following:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Call <code>DescribeLimits</code> for a particular Region to obtain your current account quotas on provisioned capacity there.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a variable to hold the aggregate read capacity units provisioned for all your tables in that Region, and one to hold the aggregate write capacity units. Zero them both.</p> </li> <li> <p>Call <code>ListTables</code> to obtain a list of all your DynamoDB tables.</p> </li> <li> <p>For each table name listed by <code>ListTables</code>, do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Call <code>DescribeTable</code> with the table name.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the data returned by <code>DescribeTable</code> to add the read capacity units and write capacity units provisioned for the table itself to your variables.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the table has one or more global secondary indexes (GSIs), loop over these GSIs and add their provisioned capacity values to your variables as well.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Report the account quotas for that Region returned by <code>DescribeLimits</code>, along with the total current provisioned capacity levels you have calculated.</p> </li> </ol> <p>This will let you see whether you are getting close to your account-level quotas.</p> <p>The per-table quotas apply only when you are creating a new table. They restrict the sum of the provisioned capacity of the new table itself and all its global secondary indexes.</p> <p>For existing tables and their GSIs, DynamoDB doesn't let you increase provisioned capacity extremely rapidly, but the only quota that applies is that the aggregate provisioned capacity over all your tables and GSIs cannot exceed either of the per-account quotas.</p> <note> <p> <code>DescribeLimits</code> should only be called periodically. You can expect throttling errors if you call it more than once in a minute.</p> </note> <p>The <code>DescribeLimits</code> Request element has no content.</p>

      description: <p>You must provide the name of the partition key attribute and a single value for that attribute. <code>Query</code> returns all items with that partition key value. Optionally, you can provide a sort key attribute and use a comparison operator to refine the search results.</p> <p>Use the <code>KeyConditionExpression</code> parameter to provide a specific value for the partition key. The <code>Query</code> operation will return all of the items from the table or index with that partition key value. You can optionally narrow the scope of the <code>Query</code> operation by specifying a sort key value and a comparison operator in <code>KeyConditionExpression</code>. To further refine the <code>Query</code> results, you can optionally provide a <code>FilterExpression</code>. A <code>FilterExpression</code> determines which items within the results should be returned to you. All of the other results are discarded. </p> <p> A <code>Query</code> operation always returns a result set. If no matching items are found, the result set will be empty. Queries that do not return results consume the minimum number of read capacity units for that type of read operation. </p> <note> <p> DynamoDB calculates the number of read capacity units consumed based on item size, not on the amount of data that is returned to an application. The number of capacity units consumed will be the same whether you request all of the attributes (the default behavior) or just some of them (using a projection expression). The number will also be the same whether or not you use a <code>FilterExpression</code>. </p> </note> <p> <code>Query</code> results are always sorted by the sort key value. If the data type of the sort key is Number, the results are returned in numeric order; otherwise, the results are returned in order of UTF-8 bytes. By default, the sort order is ascending. To reverse the order, set the <code>ScanIndexForward</code> parameter to false. </p> <p> A single <code>Query</code> operation will read up to the maximum number of items set (if using the <code>Limit</code> parameter) or a maximum of 1 MB of data and then apply any filtering to the results using <code>FilterExpression</code>. If <code>LastEvaluatedKey</code> is present in the response, you will need to paginate the result set. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Query.html#Query.Pagination">Paginating the Results</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>. </p> <p> <code>FilterExpression</code> is applied after a <code>Query</code> finishes, but before the results are returned. A <code>FilterExpression</code> cannot contain partition key or sort key attributes. You need to specify those attributes in the <code>KeyConditionExpression</code>. </p> <note> <p> A <code>Query</code> operation can return an empty result set and a <code>LastEvaluatedKey</code> if all the items read for the page of results are filtered out. </p> </note> <p>You can query a table, a local secondary index, or a global secondary index. For a query on a table or on a local secondary index, you can set the <code>ConsistentRead</code> parameter to <code>true</code> and obtain a strongly consistent result. Global secondary indexes support eventually consistent reads only, so do not specify <code>ConsistentRead</code> when querying a global secondary index.</p>

      description: <p>The <code>Scan</code> operation returns one or more items and item attributes by accessing every item in a table or a secondary index. To have DynamoDB return fewer items, you can provide a <code>FilterExpression</code> operation.</p> <p>If the total number of scanned items exceeds the maximum dataset size limit of 1 MB, the scan stops and results are returned to the user as a <code>LastEvaluatedKey</code> value to continue the scan in a subsequent operation. The results also include the number of items exceeding the limit. A scan can result in no table data meeting the filter criteria. </p> <p>A single <code>Scan</code> operation reads up to the maximum number of items set (if using the <code>Limit</code> parameter) or a maximum of 1 MB of data and then apply any filtering to the results using <code>FilterExpression</code>. If <code>LastEvaluatedKey</code> is present in the response, you need to paginate the result set. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Scan.html#Scan.Pagination">Paginating the Results</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>. </p> <p> <code>Scan</code> operations proceed sequentially; however, for faster performance on a large table or secondary index, applications can request a parallel <code>Scan</code> operation by providing the <code>Segment</code> and <code>TotalSegments</code> parameters. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Scan.html#Scan.ParallelScan">Parallel Scan</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p> <code>Scan</code> uses eventually consistent reads when accessing the data in a table; therefore, the result set might not include the changes to data in the table immediately before the operation began. If you need a consistent copy of the data, as of the time that the <code>Scan</code> begins, you can set the <code>ConsistentRead</code> parameter to <code>true</code>.</p>

      description: <p>The <code>UpdateTimeToLive</code> method enables or disables Time to Live (TTL) for the specified table. A successful <code>UpdateTimeToLive</code> call returns the current <code>TimeToLiveSpecification</code>. It can take up to one hour for the change to fully process. Any additional <code>UpdateTimeToLive</code> calls for the same table during this one hour duration result in a <code>ValidationException</code>. </p> <p>TTL compares the current time in epoch time format to the time stored in the TTL attribute of an item. If the epoch time value stored in the attribute is less than the current time, the item is marked as expired and subsequently deleted.</p> <note> <p> The epoch time format is the number of seconds elapsed since 12:00:00 AM January 1, 1970 UTC. </p> </note> <p>DynamoDB deletes expired items on a best-effort basis to ensure availability of throughput for other data operations. </p> <important> <p>DynamoDB typically deletes expired items within two days of expiration. The exact duration within which an item gets deleted after expiration is specific to the nature of the workload. Items that have expired and not been deleted will still show up in reads, queries, and scans.</p> </important> <p>As items are deleted, they are removed from any local secondary index and global secondary index immediately in the same eventually consistent way as a standard delete operation.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/TTL.html">Time To Live</a> in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. </p>

To work around this, you could specify the following for <code>ExpressionAttributeNames</code>:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>{"#P":"Percentile"}</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>#P = :val</code> </p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>Tokens that begin with the <b>:</b> character are <i>expression attribute values</i>, which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.</p> </note> <p>For more information on expression attribute names, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.AccessingItemAttributes.html">Specifying Item Attributes</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>.</p>

If any of these attributes already exist, they are replaced by the new values. You can also use <code>SET</code> to add or subtract from an attribute that is of type Number. For example: <code>SET myNum = myNum + :val</code> </p> <p> <code>SET</code> supports the following functions:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>if_not_exists (path, operand)</code> - if the item does not contain an attribute at the specified path, then <code>if_not_exists</code> evaluates to operand; otherwise, it evaluates to path. You can use this function to avoid overwriting an attribute that may already be present in the item.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>list_append (operand, operand)</code> - evaluates to a list with a new element added to it. You can append the new element to the start or the end of the list by reversing the order of the operands.</p> </li> </ul> <p>These function names are case-sensitive.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>REMOVE</code> - Removes one or more attributes from an item.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ADD</code> - Adds the specified value to the item, if the attribute does not already exist.

If <code>Value</code> is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute.</p> <note> <p>If you use <code>ADD</code> to increment or decrement a number value for an item that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses <code>0</code> as the initial value.</p> <p>Similarly, if you use <code>ADD</code> for an existing item to increment or decrement an attribute value that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses <code>0</code> as the initial value. For example, suppose that the item you want to update doesn't have an attribute named <code>itemcount</code>, but you decide to <code>ADD</code> the number <code>3</code> to this attribute anyway. DynamoDB will create the <code>itemcount</code> attribute, set its initial value to <code>0</code>, and finally add <code>3</code> to it. The result will be a new <code>itemcount</code> attribute in the item, with a value of <code>3</code>.</p> </note> </li> <li> <p>If the existing data type is a set and if <code>Value</code> is also a set, then <code>Value</code> is added to the existing set. For example, if the attribute value is the set <code>[1,2]</code>, and the <code>ADD</code> action specified <code>[3]</code>, then the final attribute value is <code>[1,2,3]</code>. An error occurs if an <code>ADD</code> action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set type. </p> <p>Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the existing data type is a set of strings, the <code>Value</code> must also be a set of strings.</p> </li> </ul> <important> <p>The <code>ADD</code> action only supports Number and set data types.

For example, if the attribute value was the set <code>[a,b,c]</code> and the <code>DELETE</code> action specifies <code>[a,c]</code>, then the final attribute value is <code>[b]</code>.

            - description: <p>Specifies how to perform the update. Valid values are <code>PUT</code> (default), <code>DELETE</code>, and <code>ADD</code>. The behavior depends on whether the specified primary key already exists in the table.</p> <p> <b>If an item with the specified <i>Key</i> is found in the table:</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>PUT</code> - Adds the specified attribute to the item. If the attribute already exists, it is replaced by the new value. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DELETE</code> - If no value is specified, the attribute and its value are removed from the item. The data type of the specified value must match the existing value's data type.</p> <p>If a <i>set</i> of values is specified, then those values are subtracted from the old set. For example, if the attribute value was the set <code>[a,b,c]</code> and the <code>DELETE</code> action specified <code>[a,c]</code>, then the final attribute value would be <code>[b]</code>. Specifying an empty set is an error.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ADD</code> - If the attribute does not already exist, then the attribute and its values are added to the item. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of <code>ADD</code> depends on the data type of the attribute:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If the existing attribute is a number, and if <code>Value</code> is also a number, then the <code>Value</code> is mathematically added to the existing attribute. If <code>Value</code> is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute.</p> <note> <p> If you use <code>ADD</code> to increment or decrement a number value for an item that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses 0 as the initial value.</p> <p>In addition, if you use <code>ADD</code> to update an existing item, and intend to increment or decrement an attribute value which does not yet exist, DynamoDB uses <code>0</code> as the initial value. For example, suppose that the item you want to update does not yet have an attribute named <i>itemcount</i>, but you decide to <code>ADD</code> the number <code>3</code> to this attribute anyway, even though it currently does not exist. DynamoDB will create the <i>itemcount</i> attribute, set its initial value to <code>0</code>, and finally add <code>3</code> to it. The result will be a new <i>itemcount</i> attribute in the item, with a value of <code>3</code>.</p> </note> </li> <li> <p>If the existing data type is a set, and if the <code>Value</code> is also a set, then the <code>Value</code> is added to the existing set. (This is a <i>set</i> operation, not mathematical addition.) For example, if the attribute value was the set <code>[1,2]</code>, and the <code>ADD</code> action specified <code>[3]</code>, then the final attribute value would be <code>[1,2,3]</code>. An error occurs if an Add action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set type. </p> <p>Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the existing data type is a set of strings, the <code>Value</code> must also be a set of strings. The same holds true for number sets and binary sets.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This action is only valid for an existing attribute whose data type is number or is a set. Do not use <code>ADD</code> for any other data types.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>If no item with the specified <i>Key</i> is found:</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>PUT</code> - DynamoDB creates a new item with the specified primary key, and then adds the attribute. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DELETE</code> - Nothing happens; there is no attribute to delete.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ADD</code> - DynamoDB creates a new item with the supplied primary key and number (or set) for the attribute value. The only data types allowed are number, number set, string set or binary set.</p> </li> </ul>
      description: <p>For the <code>UpdateItem</code> operation, represents the attributes to be modified, the action to perform on each, and the new value for each.</p> <note> <p>You cannot use <code>UpdateItem</code> to update any primary key attributes. Instead, you will need to delete the item, and then use <code>PutItem</code> to create a new item with new attributes.</p> </note> <p>Attribute values cannot be null; string and binary type attributes must have lengths greater than zero; and set type attributes must not be empty. Requests with empty values will be rejected with a <code>ValidationException</code> exception.</p>
