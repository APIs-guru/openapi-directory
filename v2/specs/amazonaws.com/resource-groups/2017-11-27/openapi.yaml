  title: AWS Resource Groups
  description: <p>Resource Groups lets you organize Amazon Web Services resources such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances, Amazon Relational Database Service databases, and Amazon Simple Storage Service buckets into groups using criteria that you define as tags. A resource group is a collection of resources that match the resource types specified in a query, and share one or more tags or portions of tags. You can create a group of resources based on their roles in your cloud infrastructure, lifecycle stages, regions, application layers, or virtually any criteria. Resource Groups enable you to automate management tasks, such as those in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Automation documents, on tag-related resources in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. Groups of tagged resources also let you quickly view a custom console in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager that shows Config compliance and other monitoring data about member resources.</p> <p>To create a resource group, build a resource query, and specify tags that identify the criteria that members of the group have in common. Tags are key-value pairs.</p> <p>For more information about Resource Groups, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/welcome.html">Resource Groups User Guide</a>.</p> <p>Resource Groups uses a REST-compliant API that you can use to perform the following types of operations.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on resource groups and resource query entities</p> </li> <li> <p>Applying, editing, and removing tags from resource groups</p> </li> <li> <p>Resolving resource group member ARNs so they can be returned as search results</p> </li> <li> <p>Getting data about resources that are members of a group</p> </li> <li> <p>Searching Amazon Web Services resources based on a resource query</p> </li> </ul>

A <code>ResourceQuery</code> specifies both a query <code>Type</code> and a <code>Query</code> string as JSON string objects. See the examples section for example JSON strings. For more information about creating a resource group with a resource query, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/gettingstarted-query.html">Build queries and groups in Resource Groups</a> in the <i>Resource Groups User Guide</i> </p> <p>When you combine all of the elements together into a single string, any double quotes that are embedded inside another double quote pair must be escaped by preceding the embedded double quote with a backslash character (\). For example, a complete <code>ResourceQuery</code> parameter must be formatted like the following CLI parameter example:</p> <p> <code>--resource-query '{"Type":"TAG_FILTERS_1_0","Query":"{\"ResourceTypeFilters\":[\"AWS::AllSupported\"],\"TagFilters\":[{\"Key\":\"Stage\",\"Values\":[\"Test\"]}]}"}'</code> </p> <p>In the preceding example, all of the double quote characters in the value part of the <code>Query</code> element must be escaped because the value itself is surrounded by double quotes. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-quoting-strings.html">Quoting strings</a> in the <i>Command Line Interface User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For the complete list of resource types that you can use in the array value for <code>ResourceTypeFilters</code>, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/supported-resources.html">Resources you can use with Resource Groups and Tag Editor</a> in the <i>Resource Groups User Guide</i>.

The <code>Query</code> contains a JSON string that represents a collection of simple tag filters. The JSON string uses a syntax similar to the <code> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/API_GetResources.html">GetResources</a> </code> operation, but uses only the <code> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/API_GetResources.html#resourcegrouptagging-GetResources-request-ResourceTypeFilters"> ResourceTypeFilters</a> </code> and <code> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/API_GetResources.html#resourcegrouptagging-GetResources-request-TagFiltersTagFilters">TagFilters</a> </code> fields. If you specify more than one tag key, only resources that match all tag keys, and at least one value of each specified tag key, are returned in your query. If you specify more than one value for a tag key, a resource matches the filter if it has a tag key value that matches <i>any</i> of the specified values.</p> <p>For example, consider the following sample query for resources that have two tags, <code>Stage</code> and <code>Version</code>, with two values each:</p> <p> <code>[{"Stage":["Test","Deploy"]},{"Version":["1","2"]}]</code> </p> <p>The results of this resource query could include the following.</p> <ul> <li> <p>An Amazon EC2 instance that has the following two tags: <code>{"Stage":"Deploy"}</code>, and <code>{"Version":"2"}</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>An S3 bucket that has the following two tags: <code>{"Stage":"Test"}</code>, and <code>{"Version":"1"}</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>The resource query results would <i>not</i> include the following items in the results, however. </p> <ul> <li> <p>An Amazon EC2 instance that has only the following tag: <code>{"Stage":"Deploy"}</code>.</p> <p>The instance does not have <b>all</b> of the tag keys specified in the filter, so it is excluded from the results.</p> </li> <li> <p>An RDS database that has the following two tags: <code>{"Stage":"Archived"}</code> and <code>{"Version":"4"}</code> </p> <p>The database has all of the tag keys, but none of those keys has an associated value that matches at least one of the specified values in the filter.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Example: <code>"TagFilters": [ { "Key": "Stage", "Values": [ "Gamma", "Beta" ] }</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>StackIdentifier</code> – applicable only if <code>Type</code> = <code>CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0</code>. The value of this parameter is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CloudFormation stack whose resources you want included in the group.</p> </li> </ul>'

If you specify more than one value for a tag key, a resource matches the filter if it has a tag key value that matches <i>any</i> of the specified values.</p> <p>For example, consider the following sample query for resources that have two tags, <code>Stage</code> and <code>Version</code>, with two values each:</p> <p> <code>[{"Stage":["Test","Deploy"]},{"Version":["1","2"]}]</code> </p> <p>The results of this resource query could include the following.</p> <ul> <li> <p>An Amazon EC2 instance that has the following two tags: <code>{"Stage":"Deploy"}</code>, and <code>{"Version":"2"}</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>An S3 bucket that has the following two tags: <code>{"Stage":"Test"}</code>, and <code>{"Version":"1"}</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>The resource query results would <i>not</i> include the following items in the results, however. </p> <ul> <li> <p>An Amazon EC2 instance that has only the following tag: <code>{"Stage":"Deploy"}</code>.</p> <p>The instance does not have <b>all</b> of the tag keys specified in the filter, so it is excluded from the results.</p> </li> <li> <p>An RDS database that has the following two tags: <code>{"Stage":"Archived"}</code> and <code>{"Version":"4"}</code> </p> <p>The database has all of the tag keys, but none of those keys has an associated value that matches at least one of the specified values in the filter.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Example: <code>"TagFilters": [ { "Key": "Stage", "Values": [ "Gamma", "Beta" ] }</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>StackIdentifier</code> – applicable only if <code>Type</code> = <code>CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0</code>.
