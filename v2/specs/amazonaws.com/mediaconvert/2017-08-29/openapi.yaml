MediaConvert analyzes the audio timing in your input and determines which correction setting to use, if needed. * Track: Adjust the duration of each audio frame by a constant amount to align the audio track length with STTS duration. Track-level correction does not affect pitch, and is recommended for tonal audio content such as music. * Frame: Adjust the duration of each audio frame by a variable amount to align audio frames with STTS timestamps.

For complex frame rate conversions, especially if your source video has already been converted from its original cadence, use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion-compensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the best conversion method frame by frame. Note that using FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and incurs a significant add-on cost.

MediaConvert determines the right number of bits to use for each part of the video to maintain the video quality that you specify. When you keep the default value, AUTO, MediaConvert picks a quality level for you, based on characteristics of your input video. If you prefer to specify a quality level, specify a number from 1 through 10. Use higher numbers for greater quality. Level 10 results in nearly lossless compression. The quality level for most broadcast-quality transcodes is between 6 and 9. Optionally, to specify a value between whole numbers, also provide a value for the setting qvbrQualityLevelFineTune. For example, if you want your QVBR quality level to be 7.33, set qvbrQualityLevel to 7 and set qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to .33.

MediaConvert rounds your QVBR quality level to the nearest third of a whole number.

In these assets, data is organized by the program map table (PMT). Each transport stream program contains subsets of data, including audio, video, and metadata. Each of these subsets of data has a numerical label called a packet identifier (PID). Each transport stream program corresponds to one MediaConvert output. The PMT lists the types of data in a program along with their PID. Downstream systems and players use the program map table to look up the PID for each type of data it accesses and then uses the PIDs to locate specific data within the asset.

For this situation, choose Match video duration (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION). In all other cases, keep the default value, Default codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION). When you choose Match video duration, MediaConvert pads the output audio streams with silence or trims them to ensure that the total duration of each audio stream is at least as long as the total duration of the video stream. After padding or trimming, the audio stream duration is no more than one frame longer than the video stream. MediaConvert applies audio padding or trimming only to the end of the last segment of the output. For unsegmented outputs, MediaConvert adds padding only to the end of the file. When you keep the default value, any minor discrepancies between audio and video duration will depend on your output audio codec.

      description: Only use this setting when you change the default value, AUTO, for the setting H264AdaptiveQuantization. When you keep all defaults, excluding H264AdaptiveQuantization and all other adaptive quantization from your JSON job specification, MediaConvert automatically applies the best types of quantization for your video content. When you set H264AdaptiveQuantization to a value other than AUTO, the default value for H264FlickerAdaptiveQuantization is Disabled (DISABLED). Change this value to Enabled (ENABLED) to reduce I-frame pop. I-frame pop appears as a visual flicker that can arise when the encoder saves bits by copying some macroblocks many times from frame to frame, and then refreshes them at the I-frame. When you enable this setting, the encoder updates these macroblocks slightly more often to smooth out the flicker.

Use Follow, default top (FOLLOW_TOP_FIELD) or Follow, default bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to produce outputs with the same field polarity as the source. For jobs that have multiple inputs, the output field polarity might change over the course of the output. Follow behavior depends on the input scan type. If the source is interlaced, the output will be interlaced with the same polarity as the source. If the source is progressive, the output will be interlaced with top field bottom field first, depending on which of the Follow options you choose.

MediaConvert determines the right number of bits to use for each part of the video to maintain the video quality that you specify. When you keep the default value, AUTO, MediaConvert picks a quality level for you, based on characteristics of your input video. If you prefer to specify a quality level, specify a number from 1 through 10. Use higher numbers for greater quality. Level 10 results in nearly lossless compression. The quality level for most broadcast-quality transcodes is between 6 and 9. Optionally, to specify a value between whole numbers, also provide a value for the setting qvbrQualityLevelFineTune. For example, if you want your QVBR quality level to be 7.33, set qvbrQualityLevel to 7 and set qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to .33.

For example, if you want your QVBR quality level to be 7.33, set qvbrQualityLevel to 7 and set qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to .33. MediaConvert rounds your QVBR quality level to the nearest third of a whole number. For example, if you set qvbrQualityLevel to 7 and you set qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to .25, your actual QVBR quality level is 7.33.

In this case, each progressive frame from the input corresponds to an interlaced field in the output. Keep the default value, Basic interlacing (INTERLACED), for all other output frame rates. With basic interlacing, MediaConvert performs any frame rate conversion first and then interlaces the frames. When you choose Optimized interlacing and you set your output frame rate to a value that isn't suitable for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert automatically falls back to basic interlacing. Required settings: To use optimized interlacing, you must set Telecine (telecine) to None (NONE) or Soft (SOFT). You can't use optimized interlacing for hard telecine outputs.

When you set H264AdaptiveQuantization to a value other than AUTO, the default value for H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization is Enabled (ENABLED). Keep this default value to adjust quantization within each frame based on spatial variation of content complexity. When you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas that can sustain more distortion with no noticeable visual degradation and uses more bits on areas where any small distortion will be noticeable. For example, complex textured blocks are encoded with fewer bits and smooth textured blocks are encoded with more bits. Enabling this feature will almost always improve your video quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn't take into account where the viewer's attention is likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a part of the screen with a lot of complex texture, you might choose to set H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization to Disabled (DISABLED). Related setting: When you enable spatial adaptive quantization, set the value for Adaptive quantization (H264AdaptiveQuantization) depending on your content. For homogeneous content, such as cartoons and video games, set it to Low. For content with a wider variety of textures, set it to High or Higher.

Hard telecine (HARD) produces a 29.97i output. Soft telecine (SOFT) produces an output with a 23.976 output that signals to the video player device to do the conversion during play back.

In this way, one GOP is shrunk slightly and one GOP is stretched slightly. When the cadence-driven I-frames are farther from the scene-change I-frame than the value you set, then the encoder leaves all I-frames in place and the GOPs surrounding the scene change are smaller than the usual cadence GOPs.

Use Follow, default top (FOLLOW_TOP_FIELD) or Follow, default bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to produce outputs with the same field polarity as the source. For jobs that have multiple inputs, the output field polarity might change over the course of the output. Follow behavior depends on the input scan type.

MediaConvert determines the right number of bits to use for each part of the video to maintain the video quality that you specify. When you keep the default value, AUTO, MediaConvert picks a quality level for you, based on characteristics of your input video. If you prefer to specify a quality level, specify a number from 1 through 10. Use higher numbers for greater quality. Level 10 results in nearly lossless compression. The quality level for most broadcast-quality transcodes is between 6 and 9. Optionally, to specify a value between whole numbers, also provide a value for the setting qvbrQualityLevelFineTune. For example, if you want your QVBR quality level to be 7.33, set qvbrQualityLevel to 7 and set qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to .33.

When you choose Optimized interlacing and you set your output frame rate to a value that isn't suitable for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert automatically falls back to basic interlacing. Required settings: To use optimized interlacing, you must set Telecine (telecine) to None (NONE) or Soft (SOFT). You can't use optimized interlacing for hard telecine outputs.

              description: Use this setting only when you also enable Scene change detection (SceneChangeDetect). This setting determines how the encoder manages the spacing between I-frames that it inserts as part of the I-frame cadence and the I-frames that it inserts for Scene change detection. We recommend that you have the transcoder automatically choose this value for you based on characteristics of your input video. To enable this automatic behavior, keep the default value by leaving this setting out of your JSON job specification. In the console, do this by keeping the default empty value. When you explicitly specify a value for this setting, the encoder determines whether to skip a cadence-driven I-frame by the value you set. For example, if you set Min I interval (minIInterval) to 5 and a cadence-driven I-frame would fall within 5 frames of a scene-change I-frame, then the encoder skips the cadence-driven I-frame. In this way, one GOP is shrunk slightly and one GOP is stretched slightly. When the cadence-driven I-frames are farther from the scene-change I-frame than the value you set, then the encoder leaves all I-frames in place and the GOPs surrounding the scene change are smaller than the usual cadence GOPs.

When set to SPEC\\_COMPLIANT, the segment target duration is rounded up to the nearest integer value if fraction seconds are greater than or equal to 0.5 (>= 0.5) and rounded down if less than 0.5 (< 0.5). You may need to use LEGACY if your client needs to ensure that the target duration is always longer than the actual duration of the segment. Some older players may experience interrupted playback when the actual duration of a track in a segment is longer than the target duration.

The valid range for each of these settings is 0 to 50,000. Each increment represents 0.00002 in CIE1931 color coordinate. Related settings - When you specify these values, you must also set Color space (ColorSpace) to HDR 10 (HDR10). To specify whether the the values you specify here take precedence over the values in the metadata of your input file, set Color space usage (ColorSpaceUsage). To specify whether color metadata is included in an output, set Color metadata (ColorMetadata).

This means the subsequent segment will have a duration of of $segmentation_time seconds. When a segmentation style of "maintain_cadence" is selected and a segment is truncated due to an avail, we will not reset the segmentation cadence. This means the subsequent segment will likely be truncated as well. However, all segments after that will have a duration of $segmentation_time seconds.

We recommend using drop duplicate (DUPLICATE_DROP) for numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps to 30 fps. For numerically complex conversions, you can use interpolate (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This results in a smooth picture, but might introduce undesirable video artifacts. For complex frame rate conversions, especially if your source video has already been converted from its original cadence, use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion-compensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the best conversion method frame by frame. Note that using FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and incurs a significant add-on cost.

Use Top field first (TOP_FIELD) or Bottom field first (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create an output that's interlaced with the same field polarity throughout. Use Follow, default top (FOLLOW_TOP_FIELD) or Follow, default bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to produce outputs with the same field polarity as the source. For jobs that have multiple inputs, the output field polarity might change over the course of the output. Follow behavior depends on the input scan type. If the source is interlaced, the output will be interlaced with the same polarity as the source.

For example, if you set Min I interval (minIInterval) to 5 and a cadence-driven I-frame would fall within 5 frames of a scene-change I-frame, then the encoder skips the cadence-driven I-frame. In this way, one GOP is shrunk slightly and one GOP is stretched slightly.

      description: Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to use when increasing or decreasing the frame rate. We recommend using drop duplicate (DUPLICATE_DROP) for numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps to 30 fps. For numerically complex conversions, you can use interpolate (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This results in a smooth picture, but might introduce undesirable video artifacts. For complex frame rate conversions, especially if your source video has already been converted from its original cadence, use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion-compensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the best conversion method frame by frame. Note that using FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and incurs a significant add-on cost.

Use Top field first (TOP_FIELD) or Bottom field first (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create an output that's interlaced with the same field polarity throughout. Use Follow, default top (FOLLOW_TOP_FIELD) or Follow, default bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to produce outputs with the same field polarity as the source. For jobs that have multiple inputs, the output field polarity might change over the course of the output. Follow behavior depends on the input scan type. If the source is interlaced, the output will be interlaced with the same polarity as the source. If the source is progressive, the output will be interlaced with top field bottom field first, depending on which of the Follow options you choose.

In this situation, choose Optimized interlacing (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to create a better quality interlaced output. In this case, each progressive frame from the input corresponds to an interlaced field in the output. Keep the default value, Basic interlacing (INTERLACED), for all other output frame rates. With basic interlacing, MediaConvert performs any frame rate conversion first and then interlaces the frames. When you choose Optimized interlacing and you set your output frame rate to a value that isn't suitable for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert automatically falls back to basic interlacing. Required settings: To use optimized interlacing, you must set Telecine (telecine) to None (NONE) or Soft (SOFT). You can't use optimized interlacing for hard telecine outputs.

We recommend using drop duplicate (DUPLICATE_DROP) for numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps to 30 fps. For numerically complex conversions, you can use interpolate (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This results in a smooth picture, but might introduce undesirable video artifacts. For complex frame rate conversions, especially if your source video has already been converted from its original cadence, use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion-compensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the best conversion method frame by frame. Note that using FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and incurs a significant add-on cost.

Then Class 145 (CLASS_145) gives you an output with a bitrate of approximately 145 Mbps and Class 220 (CLASS_220) gives you and output with a bitrate of approximately 220 Mbps. VC3 class also specifies the color bit depth of your output.

When you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas that can sustain more distortion with no noticeable visual degradation and uses more bits on areas where any small distortion will be noticeable. For example, complex textured blocks are encoded with fewer bits and smooth textured blocks are encoded with more bits. Enabling this feature will almost always improve your video quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn't take into account where the viewer's attention is likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a part of the screen with a lot of complex texture, you might choose to disable this feature.

              description: "The best way to set up adaptive quantization is to keep the default value, Auto (AUTO), for the setting Adaptive quantization (adaptiveQuantization). When you do so, MediaConvert automatically applies the best types of quantization for your video content. Include this setting in your JSON job specification only when you choose to change the default value for Adaptive quantization. For this setting, keep the default value, Enabled (ENABLED), to adjust quantization within each frame based on temporal variation of content complexity. When you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas of the frame that aren't moving and uses more bits on complex objects with sharp edges that move a lot. For example, this feature improves the readability of text tickers on newscasts and scoreboards on sports matches. Enabling this feature will almost always improve your video quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn't take into account where the viewer's attention is likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a part of the screen that doesn't have moving objects with sharp edges, such as sports athletes' faces, you might choose to disable this feature. Related setting: When you enable temporal adaptive quantization, adjust the strength of the filter with the setting Adaptive quantization (adaptiveQuantization)."

For complex frame rate conversions, especially if your source video has already been converted from its original cadence, use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion-compensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the best conversion method frame by frame. Note that using FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and incurs a significant add-on cost.
