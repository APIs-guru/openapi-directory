        The access token is used to communicate to the REST API that
        the bearer of the token has been authorized to access the API and perform
        specific actions specified by the scope that was granted during authorization.

        For API usage, the base64-encoded access token is ordinarily passed as an HTTP
        Authorization header as `Authorization: Token token=<base64-encoded token>`.

        The `login` must be URL encoded. For example, `alice@devops` must be

        The `service_id`, if given, must be URL encoded. For example,
        `prod/gke` must be encoded as `prod%2Fgke`.

        For host authentication, the `login` is the host ID with the prefix

        A client can obtain an access token by presenting a valid

        The access token is used to communicate to the REST API that the bearer
        of the token has been authorized to access the API and perform specific
        actions specified by the scope that was granted during authorization.

        The `login` must be URL encoded. For example, `alice@devops` must be
        encoded as `alice%40devops`.

        The `service_id`, if given, must be URL encoded. For example,
        `prod/gke` must be encoded as `prod%2Fgke`.

        For host authentication, the `login` is the host ID with the prefix

        Gets a signed certificate from the configured Certificate Authority service.

        The request must include a valid Certificate Signing Request, and a desired TTL in ISO 8601 format.

        *** IMPORTANT ***
        This endpoint is part of an early implementation of support for using Conjur as a certificate
        authority, and is currently available at the Community (or early alpha) level.
        This endpoint is still subject to breaking changes in the future.

        Creates a Host using the Host Factory and returns a JSON description of it.

        Requires a host factory token, which can be created using the create tokens API.
        In practice, this token is usually provided automatically as part of Conjur integration with your
        host provisioning infrastructure.

        Note: If the token was created with a CIDR restriction, you must make this API request from a whitelisted address.

        In the absence of an `account` query parameter, shows results for the account of the authorization token user.

        If an `account` query parameter is given, shows results for the specified account.

        If a `kind` query parameter is given, narrows results to only resources of that kind.

        If a `limit` is given, returns no more than that number of results. Providing an `offset`
        skips a number of resources before returning the rest. In addition, providing an `offset`
        will give `limit` a default value of 10 if none other is provided. These two parameters can
        be combined to page through results.

        If the parameter `count` is `true`, returns only the number of items in the list.

        ##### Text search

        If the `search` parameter is provided, narrows results to those pertaining to the search query.
        Search works across resource IDs and the values of annotations. It weighs results so that those
        with matching id or a matching value of an annotation called `name` appear first, then those with
        another matching annotation value, and finally those with a matching  `kind`."

        Lists resources within an organization account.

        If a `kind` query parameter is given, narrows results to only resources of that kind.

        If a `limit` is given, returns no more than that number of results. Providing an `offset`
        skips a number of resources before returning the rest. In addition, providing an `offset`
        will give `limit` a default value of 10 if none other is provided. These two parameters
        can be combined to page through results.

        If the parameter `count` is `true`, returns only the number of items in the list.

        ##### Text search

        If the `search` parameter is provided, narrows results to those pertaining to the search query.
        Search works across resource IDs and the values of annotations. It weighs results so that those
        with matching id or a matching value of an annotation called `name` appear first, then those with
        another matching annotation value, and finally those with a matching  `kind`.

        If `members` is provided, you will get the members of a role.

        If a `kind` query parameter is given, narrows results to only resources of that kind.

        If a `limit` is given, returns no more than that number of results. Providing an `offset`
        skips a number of resources before returning the rest. In addition, providing an `offset`
        will give limit a default value of 10 if none other is provided. These two parameters
        can be combined to page through results.

        If the parameter `count` is true, returns only the number of items in the list.

        ##### Text search

        If the search parameter is provided, narrows results to those pertaining to the search query.
