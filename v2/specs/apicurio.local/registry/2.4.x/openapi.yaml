    Apicurio Registry is a datastore for standard event schemas and API designs. Apicurio Registry enables developers to manage and share the structure of their data using a REST interface. For example, client applications can dynamically push or pull the latest updates to or from the registry without needing to redeploy. Apicurio Registry also enables developers to create rules that govern how registry content can evolve over time. For example, this includes rules for content validation and version compatibility.

    The Apicurio Registry REST API enables client applications to manage the artifacts in the registry. This API provides create, read, update, and delete operations for schema and API artifacts, rules, versions, and metadata. 

    The supported artifact types include:
    - Apache Avro schema
    - AsyncAPI specification
    - Google protocol buffers
    - GraphQL schema
    - JSON Schema
    - Kafka Connect schema
    - OpenAPI specification
    - Web Services Description Language
    - XML Schema Definition


    **Important**: The Apicurio Registry REST API is available from `https://MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2` by default. Therefore you must prefix all API operation paths with `../apis/registry/v2` in this case. For example: `../apis/registry/v2/ids/globalIds/{globalId}`.

      The primary way to interact with the Apicurio Registry API is to add, update, 
      or delete artifacts. This section includes all of these primary operations.

  - description: |-
      Sometimes the metadata for an artifact is important. For example, metadata includes 
      when the artifact was created, last updated, and so on. This section contains 
      operations to access (and in some cases change) an artifact's metadata.
    name: Metadata
  - description: When artifact content is updated, old versions of the artifact content are not lost.  All versions can be listed and accessed if necessary. This section describes the operations used to list and access all versions of an artifact's content and metadata.
    name: Versions
  - description: |-
      Rules can be configured on a per-artifact basis, allowing for different approaches
      to content evolution for each artifact.  These rules override any global rules
      that have been configured. This section contains the operations used to manage a
      single artifact's rules.
    name: Artifact rules
  - description: |-
      Global rules can be configured in the registry to govern how artifact content can 
      evolve over time (as artifact content is **updated**). Global rules are applied 
      whenever an artifact is added to the registry, and also whenever an artifact's 
      content is updated (only if that artifact does not have its own specific rules 
      configured). This section describes the operations used to manage the global rules.

        Creates a new artifact by posting the artifact content.  The body of the request should
        be the raw content of the artifact.  This is typically in JSON format for *most* of the 
        supported types, but may be in another format for a few (for example, `PROTOBUF`).

        The registry attempts to figure out what kind of artifact is being added from the
        following supported list:

        * Avro (`AVRO`)
        * Protobuf (`PROTOBUF`)
        * JSON Schema (`JSON`)
        * Kafka Connect (`KCONNECT`)
        * OpenAPI (`OPENAPI`)
        * AsyncAPI (`ASYNCAPI`)
        * GraphQL (`GRAPHQL`)
        * Web Services Description Language (`WSDL`)
        * XML Schema (`XSD`)

        Alternatively, you can specify the artifact type using the `X-Registry-ArtifactType` 
        HTTP request header, or include a hint in the request's `Content-Type`.  For example:

        ```
        Content-Type: application/json; artifactType=AVRO
        ```

        An artifact is created using the content provided in the body of the request.  This
        content is created under a unique artifact ID that can be provided in the request
        using the `X-Registry-ArtifactId` request header.  If not provided in the request,
        the server generates a unique ID for the artifact.  It is typically recommended
        that callers provide the ID, because this is typically a meaningful identifier, 
        and for most use cases should be supplied by the caller.

        If an artifact with the provided artifact ID already exists, the default behavior
        is for the server to reject the content with a 409 error.  However, the caller can
        supply the `ifExists` query parameter to alter this default behavior. The `ifExists`
        query parameter can have one of the following values:

        * `FAIL` (*default*) - server rejects the content with a 409 error
        * `UPDATE` - server updates the existing artifact and returns the new metadata
        * `RETURN` - server does not create or add content to the server, but instead 
        returns the metadata for the existing artifact
        * `RETURN_OR_UPDATE` - server returns an existing **version** that matches the 
        provided content if such a version exists, otherwise a new version is created

        This operation may fail for one of the following reasons:

        * An invalid `ArtifactType` was indicated (HTTP error `400`)
        * No `ArtifactType` was indicated and the server could not determine one from the content (HTTP error `400`)
        * Provided content (request body) was empty (HTTP error `400`)
        * An artifact with the provided ID already exists (HTTP error `409`)
        * The content violates one of the configured global rules (HTTP error `409`)
        * A server error occurred (HTTP error `500`)

        Updates an artifact by uploading new content.  The body of the request can
        be the raw content of the artifact or a JSON object containing both the raw content and
        a set of references to other artifacts..  This is typically in JSON format for *most*
        of the supported types, but may be in another format for a few (for example, `PROTOBUF`).
        The type of the content should be compatible with the artifact's type (it would be
        an error to update an `AVRO` artifact with new `OPENAPI` content, for example).

        The update could fail for a number of reasons including:

        * Provided content (request body) was empty (HTTP error `400`)
        * No artifact with the `artifactId` exists (HTTP error `404`)
        * The new content violates one of the rules configured for the artifact (HTTP error `409`)
        * A server error occurred (HTTP error `500`)

        When successful, this creates a new version of the artifact, making it the most recent
        (and therefore official) version of the artifact.

        Ultimately, this applies any rules configured for the artifact against the given content
        to determine whether the rules would pass or fail, but without actually updating the artifact
        content.

        The body of the request should be the raw content of the artifact.  This is typically in 
        JSON format for *most* of the supported types, but may be in another format for a few 
        (for example, `PROTOBUF`).

        The update could fail for a number of reasons including:

        * Provided content (request body) was empty (HTTP error `400`)
        * No artifact with the `artifactId` exists (HTTP error `404`)
        * The new content violates one of the rules configured for the artifact (HTTP error `409`)
        * The provided artifact type is not recognized (HTTP error `404`)
        * A server error occurred (HTTP error `500`)

        When successful, this operation simply returns a *No Content* response.  This response
        indicates that the content is valid against the configured content rules for the 
        artifact (or the global rules if no artifact rules are enabled).
