    Probely is a Web Vulnerability Scanning suite for Agile Teams. It provides
    continuous scanning of your Web Applications and lets you efficiently
    manage the lifecycle of the vulnerabilities found, in a sleek and
    intuitive ~~web interface~~ API.

    ## Quick-Start

    ### Authentication

    To use the API, you first need to create a token (API Key).
    To create a token, select a target from the drop-down list, go to the
    "Settings" page, and click on the "Integrations" tab.

    Write a name for the API Key. For example, if you want to use the API Key
    for travis,
    you could name it "travis". In this example, we chose "**example.com_key**"

    ![Creating API key][1]

      [1]: assets/qs/create_api_key_1.png



    The API key was created successfully:

    ![API key created][2]

      [2]: assets/qs/create_api_key_2.png


    On every request, you need to pass this token in the authorization header,
    like this:


    ```yaml
    Authorization: JWT eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJBRlNJQlp
    3elFsMDEiLCJ1c2VybmFtZSI6IkNIZ2tkSUROdzV0NSJ9.90UwiPGS2hlvgOLktFU0LfKuatNKm
    mEP79u17VnqT9M
    ```


    **WARNING: Treat this token as a password. With this token, you have the
    power to fully manage the target.**

    In the following examples, the token will be named as *PROBELY_AUTH_TOKEN*.


    ### Scan target

    First let's view our target list:

    ```bash
    curl https://api.probely.com/targets/ \
      -X GET \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Authorization: JWT PROBELY_AUTH_TOKEN"
    ```


    From the results, we need the **target id**:

    ```json
    {
       "count":1,
       "page_total":1,
       "page":1,
       "length":10,
       "results":[
          {
             "id":"AxtkqTE0v3E-",
             "name":"test-site",
             "desc":"",
             "url":"https://test-site.example.com",
             "settings":
                "(...)"
             ,
             "stack":
                "(...)"
             ,
             "verified":true,
             "(...)": "(...)"
          }
       ]
    }
    ```


    Now we can send a request to start a scan on target id **AxtkqTE0v3E-**

    ```bash
    curl https://api.probely.com/targets/AxtkqTE0v3E-/scan_now/ \
      -X POST \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Authorization: JWT PROBELY_AUTH_TOKEN"
    ```


    And we get a response saying that the scan is scheduled: the status is **queued**, and we've got a **scan id**:

    ```json
    {
       "changed":"2017-08-01T13:37:00.843339Z",
       "started":null,
       "completed":null,
       "mediums":0,
       "changed_by":
        "(...)"
       ,
       "highs":0,
       "status":"queued",
       "id":"S6dOMPn0SnoH",
       "created_by":
        "(...)"
       ,
       "target":
        "(...)"
       ,
       "created":"2017-08-01T13:37:00.843339Z",
       "lows":0
    }
    ```


    Using the scan id **S6dOMPn0SnoH**, we can pool the scan status:

    ```bash
    curl https://api.probely.com/targets/AxtkqTE0v3E-/scans/S6dOMPn0SnoH/ \
      -X GET \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Authorization: JWT PROBELY_AUTH_TOKEN"
    ```


    And we get a response saying that the scan status is now **started**:

    ```json
    {
       "id":"S6dOMPn0SnoH",
       "changed":"2017-08-01T13:38:12.623650Z",
       "started":null,
       "completed":null,
       "mediums":0,
       "changed_by":
        "(...)"
       ,
       "highs":0,
       "status":"started",
       "created_by":
        "(...)"
       ,
       "target":
        "(...)"
       ,
       "created":"2017-08-01T13:37:00.843339Z",
       "lows":0
    }
    ```


    The possible statuses are:

    | Status | Name | Description |
    | ------ | ---- | ----------- |
    | queued | Queued | The scan is queued to start |
    | started | Started | The scan is currently running |
    | under_review | Under Review | The scan is complete but has some findings under review |
    | completed | Completed | The scan is complete |
    | completed_with_errors | Completed with errors | The scan is complete even after getting some error(s) |
    | failed | Failed | The scan failed |
    | canceled | Canceled | The scan was canceled |
    | canceling | Canceling | The scan is being canceled |


    During the scan, the keys "lows", "mediums", and "highs" will be updated
    with the findings, as they are being found.

    After we get either the status **completed** or **completed_with_errors**,
    we can view the findings.


    ### Get vulnerabilities

    Using the previous scan id **S6dOMPn0SnoH**, we can get the scan results:

    ```bash
    curl https://api.probely.com/targets/AxtkqTE0v3E-/scans/S6dOMPn0SnoH/ \
      -X GET \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Authorization: JWT PROBELY_AUTH_TOKEN"
    ```

    We get a response saying that the scan status is now **completed**, and
    that **45** vulnerabilities were found. **14** low, **11** medium and
    **20** high:

    ```json
    {
       "id":"S6dOMPn0SnoH",
       "target":
        "(...)"
       ,
       "status":"completed",
       "started":"2017-08-01T13:37:12.623650Z",
       "completed":"2017-08-01T14:17:48.559514Z",
       "lows":14,
       "mediums":11,
       "highs":20,
       "created":"2017-08-01T13:37:00.843339Z",
       "created_by":
        "(...)"
       ,
       "changed":"2017-08-01T14:17:48.559514Z",
       "changed_by":
        "(...)"
    }
    ```

    You can now view the results of this scan, or the target findings.


    Let's start with the scan results:

    ```bash
    curl https://api.probely.com/targets/AxtkqTE0v3E-/findings/?scan=S6dOMPn0SnoH&page=1 \
      -X GET \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Authorization: JWT PROBELY_AUTH_TOKEN"
    ```

    ```json
    {
       "count":45,
       "page_total":5,
       "page":1,
       "length":10,
       "results":[
          {
             "id":79,
             "target":
              "(...)"
             ,
             "scans":
              "(...)"
             ,
             "labels":
              "(...)"
             ,
             "fix":"To fix an SQL Injection in PHP, you should use Prepared Statements.

    You can also view all the target findings, which will show all the findings
    that are not yet fixed. \\
    The structure is similar to the previous result.

      -H "Authorization: JWT PROBELY_AUTH_TOKEN"
    ```


    ### Get vulnerability details

    You can also get details for a particular finding in a target. \\
    In this example we will get the details for the same finding as in the previous
    section:

    ```bash
    curl https://api.probely.com/targets/AxtkqTE0v3E-/findings/79/ \
      -X GET \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Authorization: JWT PROBELY_AUTH_TOKEN"
    ```


    This will result on the same information, but just for this particular finding:

    ```json
    {
       "id":79,
       "target":
        "(...)"
       ,

    }
    ```

    ## Concepts

    The short version is that you run *scans* on *targets*, and *findings* are
    created for any issue that is found.
    However, there are a few more concepts that must be explained in order to
    get a complete picture of how Probely works.
    We will spend the next few sections detailing the most important concepts.


    ### Target

    A *target* defines the scope of a scan, what will and won't be included
    in the scan plan.
    This is done by filling a *target*'s *site* and *assets*.

    The entry point for the web application (and authentication) is setup
    in the *target*'s *site*.

    In modern web applications, you are probably loading resources from
    multiple domains.
    A single page app, for example, will usualy load the page from one domain
    and make AJAX requests to another.
    This is what *assets* are for: they specify what domains our scanner should
    follow and create requests for.


    ### Site
    A URL is probably not the only thing you will need to setup when scannning your application.
    Does the application have an authenticated area? Does it use basic auth?
    Does it expect a certain cookie or header?
    These parameters are all configured in the *target*'s *site*.


    We need to ensure that only allowed web applications are scanned.
    Therefore, we must verify that you have control of any site you wish to include.
    This can be done by:
      * Placing a file on a well-known location, on the site's server;
      * Creating specific DNS records.


    ### Asset

    An *asset* is very similar to a *site*. The difference is that it is a domain instead
    of a URL. Additionally, an *asset* has no login or basic auth support.
    You can still have custom cookies and headers per *asset*.

    As with the *site*, you will need to prove an *asset*'s ownership. We have added some
    rules to make your life easier, if you already have verified
    a *site* and the domains match, the validation is fast-tracked.

    ### Scans

    This is what you're here for.
    After configuring your *target*, you will want to run *scans* against it.
    You can either start a one off scan, or schedule one for later - recurring
    or not.

    During the *scan*, we will spider and run several modules to check for
    security issues, which we call *findings*.
    You can check the *findings* even before a scan ends.
    If everything goes well, the scan will complete and that is it.

    With some *findings*, our automated processes may have difficulties
    determining if it is a false positive or a legitimate issue.
    In these instances, a scan will be marked as under review, and we will
    further analyze the finding before making a decision.
    We will only show findings that, for some degree of confidence, are true
    positives.
    A finding that we are not sure of will never be displayed.

    As much as we try to prevent it, a *scan* (or a sub-module) can malfunction.
    If this happens, a *scan* is marked as:
      * "failed": the problem was irrecoverable;
      * "completed with errors": some module failed but the scan itself completed.

    During a scan, we try to determine what *frameworks* you are using
    and add this information to the *site* and *asset* objects discussed
    previously.


    ### Findings

    The last core concept is the *finding*, this is a security issue that
    we have found during our scans.
    If the same issue is found in a new scan it will not open a new finding but
    update the previous.

    A *finding* will have a lot of information about the issue.
    Namely, where it was found, URL, insertion point (e.g. cookie), parameter,
    and method.
    Evidence we gathered, and the full request and response that we used.
    Sugestions of how to go about fixing it.
    A full description of the vulnerability is also present in the
    *definition* property.
    We also assign a severity and calculate the CVSS score for each.

    Besides all this, there are also actions that you can perform on a *finding*.
    You can assign it to one user, leave comments for your team or add labels,
    and reduce or increase the severity.

    If you don't plan on fixing the *finding* and accept the risk, or you think
    we reported a false positive, you can mark the finding to reflect that.

      In Probely, a target is what defines what is being scanned.
      Connected to a target there are two other objects: a site and a list of
      assets.

      The site is the where the scan starts and will usually be the main
      entry point for your web application.

      As things are today, a single URL is not enough to describe all of the
      resources an application uses.
      For example, a modern single page web application might load the main
      page from one domain and make AJAX requests to one or more other domains.
      This where assets come in, they are used to add extra domains that
      our scanner should follow.
    name: Targets
  - description: |
      Every target has a site object, it contains the main entry URL for scans.
      Other settings are also connected to a site like login parameters,
      basic auth, and custom headers and cookies.
    name: Site
  - description: |
      Other resources a scan required access to (e.g. the domain where an
      API is being served) should be added here.
      You can also configure custom headers and cookies for each asset.

      Start and manage scans against the target.
      You can also produce reports and access the list of scanned endpoints.

      You can schedule scans for the future as a one off, or on a recurring
      basis.
    name: Scheduled
  - description: |
      Findings are security issues found during scans.
      We try hard to present valid findings only. We give as much information
      as possible to help you know exactly what to do, without having to
      resort to outside resources.

      Findings come with all the data we gathered during the scan, a
      suggestion on how to fix it, and a description of the vulnerability.
    name: Findings

      During the scans we run fingerprinters against the target and record the
      result on the site and assets.

      In Probely findings are connected to vulnerability definitions.
      This is how we keep track what type of vulnerability it is, it also
      includes a name and description.

      API keys allow you to perform operations without using your regular user.
      There are two endpoints for API keys:
        * one to create keys that can only access the current scope;
        * one that allows the user to perform operations like creating targets.

      Probely has several graphs and tables that it uses to
      display statistics of the current state of a target or account.
    name: Statistics

      If you only require a small number of active targets at a time but don't
      want to lose their history by deleting one to add another it is now
      possible to archive targets.
      This feature is still experimental, please contact our support if you
      are interested.

      Important events in your Probely account are recorded as events.
      An event is comprised of the resource acted on, when it occurred and
      what kind of event (ex: `target_created`).

      Besides fetching these events using their endpoints you are also able
      to receive them in real-time by registering webhooks.
      The event is sent to every registered webhook URL as JSON and an HTTP
      success status code (2XX) is expected in the response.
      In case a webhook fails it will be retried with an exponential back-off
      (maxing out at 4 hours) during 2 days, at the end of which an email is
      sent to the users informing of this failure.
      For security we suggest using an unique hard to guess identifier for the
      webhook:
      ```
      https://webhook.example.com/d69179e3b06549469817560c650be98f/
      ```
      Webhook URL's are required to be HTTPS.

      When registering a webhook according to the chosen endpoint you can
      receive any event for the account or only events for a single target.
      A target webhook will not receive `user_created`, `user_deleted` and
      `target_created` events and all events received pertain to the target
      the webhook was created for.

      To start integrating Probely with Jira you will first need to add the
      Probely app to your Jira instance.
      Go to the marketplace, search for Probely and install the application.
      When prompted click the "Get Started" button and follow the steps described
      to connect both accounts.
