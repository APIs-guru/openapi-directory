      description: Whenever Orthanc receives a new DICOM instance, this event is recorded in the so-called _Changes Log_. This enables remote scripts to react to the arrival of new DICOM resources. A typical application is auto-routing, where an external script waits for a new DICOM instance to arrive into Orthanc, then forward this instance to another modality.

      description: For medical traceability, Orthanc can be configured to store a log of all the resources that have been exported to remote modalities. In auto-routing scenarios, it is important to prevent this log to grow indefinitely as incoming instances are routed. You can either disable this logging by setting the option `LogExportedResources` to `false` in the configuration file, or periodically clear this log by `DELETE`-ing this URI. This route might be removed in future versions of Orthanc.

Beware that this is a highly time-consuming operation, as all the DICOM instances will be parsed again, and as all the Orthanc index will be regenerated. If you have a large database to process, it is advised to use the Housekeeper plugin to perform this action resource by resource
