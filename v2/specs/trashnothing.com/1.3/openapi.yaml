      Manage conversations and messages with other users. <br /><br /> It's important to note that messages are always sent by email to the users.   So it's possible to create a fully functional app using the trash nothing API without using any of the conversations or messages API endpoints.  These API endpoints are useful for developers who want to build a complete messaging interface into their app.

            If set to 1, the num_unread field in the response will be set to the count of the total number of conversations that have unread messages. <br /><br /> This is useful for showing users the total number of unread messages that they have in their inbox. Calculating the count will slow the request down a bit so setting this should be avoided for requests where it's not needed (eg. requesting archived or blocked conversations or requests that are just paging through older conversations).

        NOTE: When paging through the posts returned by this endpoint, there will be at most 1,000 posts that can be returned (eg. 50 pages worth of posts with the default per_page value of 20).  In areas where there are more than 1,000 posts, clients can use more specific query parameters to adjust which posts are returned.
        NOTE: Passing the latitude, longitude and radius parameters filters all posts by their location and so these parameters will temporarily override the current users' location preferences. When latitude, longitude and radius are not specified, public posts will be filtered by the current users' location preferences.

            How to sort the posts that are returned.  One of: date, active, distance <br /><br />
            Date sorting will sort posts from newest to oldest. Active sorting will sort active posts before satisfied, withdrawn and expired posts and then sort by date. Distance sorting will sort the closest posts first.

The trashnothing source is for public posts that are posted on trash nothing but are not associated with any group. The open_archive_groups source provides a way to easily request posts from groups that have open_archives set to true without having to pass a group_ids parameter.  When passed, it will automatically return posts from open archive groups that are within the area specified by the latitude, longitude and radius parameters (or the current users' location if latitude, longitude and radius aren't passed). <br /><br /> NOTE: For requests using an api key instead of oauth, passing the trashnothing source or the open_archive_groups source makes the latitude, longitude and radius parameters required.

So with short expirations (eg. < 8 hours), there is a chance that the post may expire before it's approved and so it will never be published.

        This endpoint provides an easy way to get a feed of all the changes that have been made to publicly published posts on trash nothing.  Similar to the /posts/all endpoint, only data from the last 30 days is available and the changes are sorted by date (newest first).  Every change includes the date of the change, the post_id of the post that was changed and the type of change. <br /><br /> The different types of changes that are returned are listed below. <br /><br /> - deleted<br /> - undeleted<br /> - satisfied<br /> - promised<br /> - unpromised<br /> - withdrawn<br /> - edited<br /> <br /> For edited changes, clients can use the retrieve post API endpoint to get the edits that have been made to the post.

To pass a number of days, provide the number of days prefixed by 'd' (eg. 1d 90d). <br /><br /> Note that updates may not appear instantly after submission because the volunteer moderators of many groups may have additional automatic or manual review processes in place that can cause delays.  So with short expirations (eg. < 8 hours), there is a chance that the post may expire before the update is approved and so it will never be published.
                    <br><br> NOTE: The max expiration for a post is 90 days after the post is published.  So updates to posts that try to set an longer expiration will be silently changed to just apply the max expiration.

Some warnings returned after submitting  an update have a preference_key string property so that users can opt out of those warnings in the future.  To save this opt-out preference, set the property indicated by the preference_key in the preferences object (eg. preferences[preference_key] = 1).  The preferences object is never modified by the server - it is up to the client to initialize, modify and persist the preferences object.

Every time an update is submitted and the response indicates that the submission was not successful, the session object returned in the response should override the clients copy of the session.

        Allows the current user to submit feedback on a user.  The current user can only leave feedback on a user if the feedback allowed property on that user is set to true (see User definition for more details). And the system will only store the most recent feedback submission that the current user has submitted on a user. If the current user submits feedback multiple times, the newest feedback will overwrite the older feedback. This allows users to update their feedback as long as the feedback allowed property allows it.

            A 2 letter country code for the country that has been automatically detected for the user (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 ). May be null if no country has been set.

                The percent of feedback that this user has received in the last year that was positive. May be null if a user has not received enough feedback to calculate a percentage.

            restriction:
              description: |
                If the current user can leave positive or negative feedback on this user then restriction is null. <br /><br /> Otherwise, restriction is set to a string that explains why feedback is currently restricted and what type of feedback is restricted. The string will be one of the following:  no-recent-messages, negative-score, moderator, [days]-day-wait-for-negative <br /><br /> - **no-recent-messages**: The current user has not received any messages from this user in the last 30 days. <br /> - **negative-score**: The current user has a negative feedback and will not be able to leave feedback until their score is >= 0. <br /> - **moderator**: The user is a moderator and leaving feedback on moderators is not currently supported. <br /> - **[days]-day-wait-for-negative**: Positive feedback is not restricted but the current user must wait
                  some number of days before they will be able to leave negative feedback on this user.  This string can 
                  change depending on the number of days.  For example, when the current user must wait one day, the
                  string will be '1-day-wait-for-negative'.  A wait is necessary because a lot of negative feedback results
                  from communication issues that are resolved with more time.

            score:
              description: |
                The feedback score of this user.  Higher scores are better.   Scores are calculated by substracting the total number of negative feedback from the total number of positive feedback that a user has received.  May be null if a user has not received enough feedback to calculate a score.

        Provides access to specific public API endpoints which don't require user authorization. <br /><br /> The API currently allows api key access to list, search and retrieve posts (for public posts and posts on open archive groups) and to list, search and retrieve groups. <br /><br /> NOTE: Some API endpoints behave differently when requests are made using api keys instead of oauth (because api key requests have no user associated with them).  Check the documentation for each endpoint for a description of the differences.
