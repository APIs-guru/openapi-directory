A List of Contact objects, a list of String E.164 numbers, or a list of CallFire contactIds can be used as the data source for the created contact list. After contact list is added into the CallFire system, contact lists goes through seven system safeguards that check the accuracy and consistency of the data. For example, our system checks that contact number is formatted correctly, is valid, is not duplicated in another contact list, or is not added on a specific DNC list. You can configure to keep/merge or remove contacts which do not complies these rules. If contacts were not added to a contact list after the validation, this means the data needs to be properly formatted and corrected before calling this API

      description: "Create a Webhook for notification in the CallFire system. Use the webhooks API to receive notifications of important CallFire events. Select the resource to listen to, and then choose the resource events to receive notifications on. When an event triggers, a POST will be made to the callback URL with a payload of notification information. Available resources and their events include 'CccCampaign': ['started', 'stopped', 'finished'], 'CallBroadcast': ['started', 'stopped', 'finished'], 'TextBroadcast': ['started', 'stopped', 'finished'], 'OutboundCall': ['finished'], 'InboundCall': ['finished'], 'OutboundText': ['finished'], 'InboundText': ['finished'], 'ContactList': ['validationFinished', 'validationFailed'], 'MonthlyRenewal': ['failed', 'finished'], 'LowBalance': ['failed', 'finished']. Webhooks support secret token which is used as signing key to HmacSHA1 hash of json payload which is returned in 'X-CallFire-Signature' header. This header can be used to verify callback POST is coming from CallFire. See [security guide](https://developers.callfire.com/security-guide.html)"
