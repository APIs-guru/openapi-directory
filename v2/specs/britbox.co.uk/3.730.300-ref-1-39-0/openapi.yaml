    An Orchestration Layer that takes ISL services and packages them in a more targeted way for front-end applications.
    This in turn makes client integration easier and reduces the complexity and size of front-end applications.

    Rocket is also customisable - allowing UI engineers to ‘remix’ the existing back-end services into something that
    best suits the application they are developing.

        Authorize a device from a generated device authorization code.

        This is the second step in the process of authorizing a device by pin code.

        Firstly the device must request a generated authorization code via the
        `/authorization/device/code` endpoint.

        This endpoint then authorizes the device associated with the code to sign in
        to a user account. Typically this endpoint will be called from a page
        presented in the web app under the account section.

        Once authorized, the device will then be able to sign in to that account
        via the `/authorization/device` endpoint, without needing to provide the 
        credentials of the user.

      description: |
        Get the video files associated with an item given maximum resolution, device type
        and one or more delivery types.

        This endpoint accepts an Account Catalog token, however if when requesting
        playback files you receive an *403 status code with error code 1* then the file
        you're requesting is classification restricted. This means you should switch
        to target the `/account/items/{id}/videos-guarded` endpoint, passing it an Account
        Playback token. If not already obtained, this token can be requested via the
        `/itv/pinauthorization` endpoint with an account level pin.

        For convenience you may also access free / public files through this endpoint
        instead of the /items/{id}/videos endpoint, when authenticated.

        Returns an array of video file objects which each include a url to a video.

        The first entry in the array contains what is predicted to be the best match.
        The remainder of the entries, if any, may contain resolutions below what was
        requests. For example if you request HD-720 the response may also contain
        SD entries.

        If you specify multiple delivery types, then the response array will insert
        types in the order you specify them in the query. For example `stream,progressive`
        would return an array with 0 or more stream files followed by 0 or more progressive files.

        If no files are found a 404 is returned.

        single item belonging to a particular show will be included in the returned list.

        The next episode to continue watching for a particular show will be the most recent
        incompletely watched episode, or the next episode following the most recently
        completely watched episode. Based on the specified `show_item_type` type, either the next
        episode, the season of the next episode, or the show will be included in the list.

            The item type to be returned for continue watching items belonging to a show.

            Multiple episodes under the same show may be watched or in progress, however only a
            single item belonging to a particular show will be included in the returned list.

            The next episode to continue watching for a particular show will be the most recent
            incompletely watched episode, or the next episode following the most recently
            completely watched episode. Based on the specified `show_item_type` type, either the next
            episode, the season of the next episode, or the show will be included in the list.

            If `episode` is specified, then only the next episode to continue watching for a
            show will be returned.

            If `season` is specified, then only the season of the next episode will be returned.

            If `show` is specified, then only the show of the next episode will be returned

            The recommended value of this parameter should reflect the desitination the
            user will be sent to when they select this item in the list. So if a user will
            be sent to the show detail page then this should be `show` and you can use
            the `include` parameter to get metadata about the episode or season if needed

        This will send a verification email to the email address of the primary profile containing
        a link which, once clicked, completes the verification process via the /verify-email endpoint.

        Note that when an account is created this email is sent automatically so there's no need
        to call this directly.

        If the user doesn't click the link before it expires then this endpoint can be called
        to request a new verification email. In the future it may also be used if we add support
        for changing an account email address.

        Get Catalog tokens for an account using a device authorization code.
        Where a Profile level token of Catalog scope exists it will also be returned.

        This is the final step in the process of authorizing a device by pin code.

        Firstly the device must request a generated authorization code via the
        `/authorization/device/code` endpoint.

        The code is subsequently used to authorize the device to sign in to a given
        account via the `/account/devices/authorization` endpoint. Typically this
        will be from a page presented in the web app under the account section.

        Once authorized, this endpoint will allow the device to sign in without
        needing to provide the credentials of the user.

        Get a generated device authorization code.

        This is the first step in the process of authorizing a device by pin code.
        The device will make a request to this endpoint providing a unique identifier
        for the device such as a serial number. This endpoint will then return a
        generated code which is tied to the given device.

        The code may subsequently be used to authorize the device to sign in to an
        account via the `/account/devices/authorization` endpoint. Typically this
        will be from a page presented in the web app under the account section.

        Once authorized, the device will then be able to sign in to that account
        via the `/authorization/device` endpoint, without needing to provide the 
        credentials of the user.

            If no value is specified no dependencies are expanded.

            If 'children' is specified then the list of any direct children will be expanded. For example
            seasons of a show or episodes of a season.

            If 'all' is specified then the parent chain will be expanded along with any child list at each level.
            For example if an episode is specified then its season will be expanded and that season's episode list.
            The season will have its show expanded and the show will have its season list expanded.

            The 'all' options is useful when you deep link into a show/season/episode for the first time as
            it provides full context for navigating around the show page. Subsequent navigation around
            children of the show should only need to request expand of children.

            If 'ancestors' is specified then only the parent chain is included.

            If 'parent' is specified then only the direct parent is included.

            If an expand is specified which is not relevant to the item type, it will be ignored.

            Given a provided show id, it can be useful to get the details of a child season. This option
            provides a means to return the `first` or `latest` season of a show given the show id.

            The `expand` parameter also works here so for example you could land on a show page and request the
            latest season along with `expand=all`. This would then return the detail of the latest season with
            its list of child episode summaries, and also expand the detail of the show with its list of seasons summaries.

            Note the `id` parameter must be a show id for this parameter to work correctly.

            Only relevant when loading item detail pages as these embed a detailed item in the main page entry.

            If no value is specified no item dependencies are expanded.

            If 'children' is specified then the list of any direct children will be expanded. For example
            seasons of a show or episodes of a season.

            If 'all' is specified then the parent chain will be expanded along with any child list at each level.
            For example if an episode is specified then its season will be expanded and that season's episode list.
            The season will have its show expanded and the show will have its season list expanded.

            The 'all' options is useful when you deep link into a show/season/episode for the first time as
            it provides full context for navigating around the show page. Subsequent navigation around
            children of the show should only need to request expand of children.

            If 'ancestors' is specified then only the parent chain is included

            If an expand is specified which is not relevant to the item type, it will be ignored.

          name: item_detail_expand

            enum:

            Only relevant when loading show detail pages as these embed a detailed item in the main page entry.

            Since the introduction of the D1,2,3 templates this parameter is now somewhat redundant, or less
            likely to have any effect. While it may still be useful in some cases, most of the time the season
            selection will be dictated by the configuration of the rows scheduled on the show detail page.
            This parameter will only take effect if there are rows used to schedule episodes of a season, like
            D1,2,3, or if no rows have a value set for their `seasonOrder` custom field.

            Given a targeted show page, it can be useful to get the details of a child season. This option
            provides a means to return the `first` or `latest` season of a show embedded in the page.

            The `expand` parameter also works here so for example you could land on a show page and request the
            `item_detail_select_season=latest` along with `item_detail_expand=all`. This would then return the
            detail of the latest season with its list of child episode summaries, and also expand
            the detail of the show with its list of seasons summaries.

            Only relevant when loading item detail pages as these embed a detailed item in the main page entry.

            If no value is specified no item dependencies are expanded.

            If 'children' is specified then the list of any direct children will be expanded. For example
            seasons of a show or episodes of a season.

            If 'all' is specified then the parent chain will be expanded along with any child list at each level.
            For example if an episode is specified then its season will be expanded and that season's episode list.
            The season will have its show expanded and the show will have its season list expanded.

            The 'all' options is useful when you deep link into a show/season/episode for the first time as
            it provides full context for navigating around the show page. Subsequent navigation around
            children of the show should only need to request expand of children.

            If 'ancestors' is specified then only the parent chain is included

            If an expand is specified which is not relevant to the item type, it will be ignored.

            Only relevant when loading show detail pages as these embed a detailed item in the main page entry.

            Since the introduction of the D1,2,3 templates this parameter is now somewhat redundant, or less
            likely to have any effect. While it may still be useful in some cases, most of the time the season
            selection will be dictated by the configuration of the rows scheduled on the show detail page.
            This parameter will only take effect if there are rows used to schedule episodes of a season, like
            D1,2,3, or if no rows have a value set for their `seasonOrder` custom field.

            Given a targeted show page, it can be useful to get the details of a child season. This option
            provides a means to return the `first` or `latest` season of a show embedded in the page.

            The `expand` parameter also works here so for example you could land on a show page and request the
            `item_detail_select_season=latest` along with `item_detail_expand=all`. This would then return the
            detail of the latest season with its list of child episode summaries, and also expand
            the detail of the show with its list of seasons summaries.

  /schedules:
    get:
      description: |
        Returns schedules for a defined set of channels over a requested period.

        Schedules are requested in hour blocks and returned grouped by the channel
        they belong to.

        For example, to load 12 hours of schedules for channels `4343` and `5234`,
        on 21/2/2017 starting from 08:00.

        ```
        channels=4343,5234
        date=2017-02-21
        hour=8
        duration=12
        ```

        Please remember that `date` and `hour` combined represent a normal datetime, 
        so they should be converted to UTC on the client - this will help to avoid 
        issues with EPG schedules near midnight.

        If a channel id is passed which doesn't exist then this endpoint will
        return an empty schedule list for it. If instead we returned 404,
        this would invalidate all other channel schedules in the same request
        which would be unfriendly for clients presenting these channel schedules.

    FeatureFlags:
      description: |
        The set of opt in feature flags which cause breaking changes to responses.

        While Rocket APIs look to avoid breaking changes under the active major version, the formats of responses
        may need to evolve over this time.

        These feature flags allow clients to select which response formats they expect and avoid breaking
        clients as these formats evolve under the current major version.

        ### Flags

        - `all` - Enable all flags. Useful for testing. _Don't use in production_.
        - `idp` - Dynamic item detail pages with schedulable rows.
        - `ldp` - Dynamic list detail pages with schedulable rows.
        - `hb` - Hubble formatted image urls.
        - `rpt` - Updated resume point threshold logic.
        - `cas` - "Custom Asset Search", inlcude `customAssets` in search results.
        - `lrl` - Do not pre-populate related list if more than `max_list_prefetch` down the page.
        - `cd` - Custom Destination support.

        See the `feature-flags.md` for available flag details.
