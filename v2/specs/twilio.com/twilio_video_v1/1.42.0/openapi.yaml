                    The string's format is `{width}x{height}` where: 

                    * 16 <= `{width}` <= 1280

                    * HD = `1280x720`

                    Note that the `resolution` imposes an aspect ratio to the resulting composition. When the original video tracks are constrained by the aspect ratio, they are scaled to fit.
