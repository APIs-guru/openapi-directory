Overall, this means that interest can be compounded several times in a year depending on the number of times that interest payments are made.

                                      Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole balance as balance increases.

                                      2. Tiered
                                      Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each tier as balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed for that tier and not on whole balance.

                                      3. Whole
                                      The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the BCA balance

                                            The annual equivalent rate (AER) is interest that is calculated under the assumption that any interest paid is combined with the original balance and the next interest payment will be based on the slightly higher account balance. Overall, this means that interest can be compounded several times in a year depending on the number of times that interest payments are made.

                                      Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole balance as balance increases.

                                      2. Tiered
                                      Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each tier as balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed for that tier and not on whole balance.

                                      3. Whole
                                      The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the PCA balance

                                            The annual equivalent rate (AER) is interest that is calculated under the assumption that any interest paid is combined with the original balance and the next interest payment will be based on the slightly higher account balance. Overall, this means that interest can be compounded several times in a year depending on the number of times that interest payments are made. 

                                            For SME Loan, this APR is the representative APR which includes any account fees.
