    AppVeyor is a hosted continuous integration service which runs on Microsoft
    Windows.  The AppVeyor REST API provides a RESTful way to interact with the
    AppVeyor service.  This includes managing projects, builds, deployments,
    and the teams that build them.

    Additional help and discussion of the AppVeyor REST API is available at
    http://help.appveyor.com/discussions

    This Swagger definition is an **unofficial** description of the AppVeyor
    REST API maintained at https://github.com/kevinoid/appveyor-swagger
    Please report any issues or suggestions for this Swagger definition at

    #### API Conventions

    Fields which are missing from update operations (`PUT` requests) are
    typically reset to their default values.  So although most fields are not
    technically required, they should usually be specified in practice.

securityDefinitions:
  apiToken:
    description: |-
      API token can be acquired from https://ci.appveyor.com/api-keys
      This value must be passed to the server in the `Authorization` header as `"Bearer <token>"`.  Since [bearer token authentication support is not explicitly supported in OpenAPI 2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/583), client code will vary.  Clients created with [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) should set `apiKeyPrefix` to `"Bearer"` and set `apiKey` to the token.  Other clients may need to set `apiKey` to the string `"Bearer <token>"`.
      Note that this should be [fixed in OpenAPI 3.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/pull/807)), whenever that becomes available and supported.
      #### User-Level API Keys
      To use a user-level API key (prefixed with "v2."), `basePath` must be changed to `/api/account/{accountName}` where `{accountName}` is the name of the account for which requests will be made.

            The schema type of this response could be specified as `file` to
            denote opaque binary data.  The generated Java code for `file`
            saves the response as a temporary file, making it a little more
            difficult to use and less efficient for common cases.  If `string`
            causes problems for other generators, can switch to `file` type.

            The body of requests should contain YAML data.  It is unclear how
            to specify this since the OpenAPI spec requires `schema` without
            `type` for `in: body` parameters and does not allow `type: file` in
            `schema`.  See https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/326
            swagger-codegen (for Java, probably others) allows a binary
            string body parameter with non-application/json `consumes` to be
            passed through in the request body without conversion to JSON.

      A schema for values which have an undocumented/unknown type.

      Although the type of such values could be left unspecified according to
      JSON Schema (and by extension OpenAPI 2.0), such unspecified types cause
      tool failures (e.g. swagger-codegen).  So this type can be used as a
      placeholder to prevent errors and document the behavior.
