To determine the number of pages in a result set, divide the total value (total number of tasks matching input criteria) by this limit value, and then round up to the next integer. For example, if the <strong>total</strong> value was <code>120</code> (120 total tasks) and the <strong>limit</strong> value was <code>50</code> (show 50 tasks per page), the total number of pages in the result set is three, so the seller would have to make three separate <strong>getSchedules</strong> calls to view all tasks matching the input criteria.</span></p></span></p>
