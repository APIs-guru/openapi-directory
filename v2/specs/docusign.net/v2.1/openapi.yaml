      The AcccountBrands resource provides methods that enable you to create and manage brands for an account.

      Branding enables you to add the look and feel of your organization's brand to the sending, signing, and email processes, making it easier for recipients to identify envelopes coming from your organization.

      The DocuSign Account Custom Branding feature enables you to set the colors, logo, and text that recipients see at the account level. The settings associated with a brand are applied to all of the envelopes that use the brand. You can create multiple brand profiles for different corporate brands or internal departments.

      **Note:** To use this resource, branding for either signing or sending must be enabled for the account (either `canSelfBrandSend`, `canSelfBrandSign`, or both of these account settings must be set to **true**).

      The `AccountConsumerDisclosures` resource provides methods that enable you to enable, retrieve, and manage the Electronic Record and Signature Consent Disclosure (ERSD) options for your account. This is the disclosure that displays to each new recipient who is going to sign or add other information, or who is required to view the documents you send to them. The recipient must read and agree to the terms of the disclosure before they can access and take action on the documents you send. The ERSD does not apply to copy-only recipients, but does apply to recipients who must sign or view your documents.

      You can use either the default ERSD that DocuSign provides for U.S.-based transactions, or a custom ERSD. 

      ## Languages

      **Important:** The system does not translate the ERSD for you. The default ERSD is always in English. For a custom ERSD, an account administrator must create a version of the disclosure for each language that your signers use. When you create a version of your custom ERSD for a specific signer language, you must:

      1. Specify the language code (`langCode`) for the signer language.
      2. Provide the `esignAgreementText` and `esignText` in the language associated with the `langCode`.

      For more information, see [Legal Disclosure](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/ndse-admin-guide-legal-disclosure).

      Custom fields enable you to record custom information about envelopes that you can then use for sorting, organizing, searching, and other downstream processes. 

      For example, you can use custom fields to copy envelopes or data to multiple areas in Salesforce. eOriginal customers can eVault all of their documents from the web app by setting an account custom field with a name like `eVault with eOriginal` to **true.**

      You can also use account custom fields to set the following information:

      - Tracking ID
      - Department 
      - Use case
      - Other envelope metadata

      ## Envelope Custom Field Visibility

      When you create an envelope custom field for your account, you have the following options: 

      - Make it a required field for senders at the time of sending
      - Display it as an optional field at the time of sending
      - Set a specific value for the field behind the scenes (NOT SURE IF THIS IS RIGHT; MIGHT JUST BE AN UNUSED DRAFT FIELD)

      Envelope recipients do not see the envelope custom fields.

      ## Types of Envelope Custom Fields

      There are two types of envelope custom fields:

      - `text`: Enables the sender to enter the value for the field. 
      - `list`: Enables the sender to select the value of the field from a predetermined list.

      The EnvelopeCustomFields resource provides methods that allow you manage custom fields in an envelope.

      Custom fields can be used in the envelopes for your account to record information about the envelope, help search for envelopes and track information. The envelope custom fields are shown in the Envelope Settings section when a user is creating an envelope in the DocuSign member console. The envelope custom fields are not seen by the envelope recipients.

      There are two types of envelope custom fields:

      - `text`: Enables the sender to enter the value for the field.
      - `list`: Enables the sender to select the value of the field from a predetermined list.

      The EnvelopeDocumentFields resource provides methods that allow you to manage custom fields on a document.

      Custom fields are name-value pairs that are returned by the API but otherwise not used by DocuSign. They are not seen by the envelope recipients.

      Envelope locks allow you to manage locks on an envelope.

      To prevent users from changing an envelope while another user is
      modifying it, you can lock the envelope and set the time until
      the lock expires.

      To use envelope locks, the user must have envelope locking capability enabled.

      The EnvelopeRecipients resource enables you manage the recipients of an envelope.
      All recipient types share a set of [core parameters](#core-recipient-parameters),
      but some recipient types have additional parameters.
      You specify the recipient type using the `recipientType` parameter. The recipient types are as follows:

      <br>

      | Recipient type                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

      | [Agent](#agent-recipient)                           | Agent recipients can add name and email information for recipients that appear after the agent in routing order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
      | [Carbon Copy](#carbon-copy-recipient)               | Carbon copy recipients get a copy of the envelope but don't need to sign, initial, date, or add information to any of the documents. This type of recipient can be used in any routing order. Carbon copy recipients receive their copy of the envelope when the envelope reaches the recipient's order in the process flow and when the envelope is completed.                                                                            |
      | [Certified Delivery](#certified-delivery-recipient) | Certified delivery recipients must receive the completed documents for the envelope to be completed. However, they don't need to sign, initial, date, or add information to any of the documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
      | [Editor](#editor-recipient)                         | Editors have the same management and access rights for the envelope as the sender. They can make changes to the envelope as if they were using the Advanced Correct feature. This recipient can add name and email information, add or change the routing order, set authentication options, and can edit signature/initial tabs and data fields for the remaining recipients. The recipient must have a DocuSign account to be an editor. |
      | [In-Person Signer](#in-person-signer-recipient)     | In-person signer recipients are DocuSign users who act as signing hosts in the same physical location as the signer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
      | [Intermediary](#intermediary-recipient)             | Intermediaries are recipients who can, but are not required to, add name and email information for recipients at the same or subsequent level in the routing order, unless subsequent agents, editors, or intermediaries are added.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
      | [Seal](#seal-recipient)                             | Electronic seal recipients represent legal entities rather than individuals. Organizations and governments can use electronic seals to show evidence of origin and integrity of documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
      | [Signer](#signer-recipient)                         | Signers are recipients who must sign, initial, date, or add data to form fields on the documents in the envelope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
      | [Witness](#witness-recipient)                       | Witnesses are recipients whose signatures affirm that the identified signers have signed the documents in the envelope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would, but when the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to this URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, it is up to the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) to then request a recipient token to launch a signing session.<br/><br/>If the value `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN` is used for this node, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation that would be launched by any partner.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application and DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the sending application sets  the `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL` property to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) be used to verify the identity of the recipient.<br/><br>If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` property is set, DocuSign ignores the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` property using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId, recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The customFields must be part of the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets.<br/><br/>_Example_:<br/>`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`|

Documents that do not have tabs are always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

      ## In-Person Signer Recipient

      An in-person recipient is a DocuSign user, acting as a Signing Host, who is in the same physical location as the signer.

      The following restrictions apply to using electronic notary when sending documents:

      * Authentication methods are allowed for the signer but not the notary.
      * The Sign On Paper, Document Markup, Field Markup and Change Signer options cannot be used for the documents.
      * Tabs may be assigned to the signer, but cannot be assigned to the notary.

      See [eNotary Resources][enotary-resources] in the DocuSign Support Center for more information about how the eNotary feature works.

      In addition to the [core parameters](#core-recipient-parameters), this type adds the following parameters:

      ## Intermediary Recipient

      An intermediary is a recipient who can, but is not required to,
      add name and email information for recipients
      at the same or subsequent level in the routing order,
      unless subsequent agents, editors or intermediaries are added.

      In addition to the [core parameters](#core-recipient-parameters), this recipient type has the following parameters:

      <br>


      | Name               | Required | Schema Type        | Description                                                                  |

      | documentVisibility | No       | documentVisibility | A complex type that specifies which documents are visible to this recipient. |

      <br>



      ## Seal Recipient

      An electronic seal recipient is a legal entity rather than an actual person.
      Electronic Seals can be used by organizations and governments to show evidence
      of origin and integrity of documents.
      Even though electronic seals can be represented by a tab in a document,
      they do not require user interaction and apply automatically in the order specified by the sender.
      The sender is therefore the person authorizing usage of the electronic seal in the flow.

      Electronic seal recipients rely on a subset of core properties, described as follows, plus the `recipientSignatureProviders` parameter:


      <br>


      | Name                        | Required        | Schema Type                                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
      | :-------------------------- | :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

      | recipientSignatureProviders | Yes             | String                                                                | Indicates which electronic seal to apply on documents when creating an envelope.                                                                                                                                                                 |


      <br>

      By default, Electronic Seals apply to all documents in an envelope.
      However, the `sealDocumentsWithTabsOnly` property (see `recipientSignatureProvider`)
      allows you to seal only documents that have `signHere` tabs set for the Electronic Seal recipients.

      The EnvelopeRecipientTabs resource provides methods that enable you
      to add,
      update,
      and delete tabs
      from an envelope.
      Tabs are associated with a specific recipient
      in an envelope
      and are only used by the recipient types
      In Person Signers and Signers.

      ## Tab Types

      Some tabs enable values to be entered by the signer.
      Those tabs' values can be preset either through the web browser
      or via the API. Other tab types use information that is already
      recognized by the DocuSign platform.
      These tabs cannot have their value updated on a per-tab basis
      by the API or via the browser. In some cases, the info might be
      settable using a different technique.
      For example, the Full name tab uses the signer's name,
      which is set elsewhere in the request.

      Here is the list of tabs and whether you can or cannot set their values in the tab definition:

      | Email (`email`)                                | Allows the recipient to enter an email address. This is a one-line field that checks that a valid email address is entered. It uses the same parameters as a Text tab, with the validation message and pattern set for email information.<br><br>When getting information that includes this tab type, the original value of the tab when the associated envelope was sent is included in the response. This value can be set.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

      ## Requesting Payments

      The Payments feature of the DocuSign eSignature REST API
      lets you collect payments
      along with signatures and other information.

      To send a request for payment
      and collect payments,
      you need a payment gateway account,
      which is the destination for the payments.
      Create a payment account
      with a supported payment gateway,
      and then connect the payment gateway account
      to your DocuSign account.
      To learn how to connect a payment gateway account
      to your DocuSign account
      see [Managing Payment Gateways][paymentgateways]
      in the DocuSign Support Center.
      You must connect and manage payment gateway accounts manually
      through the DocuSign Admin console
      and through your chosen payment gateway.
      There is no public API
      for connecting payment gateway accounts
      to DocuSign accounts
      or for managing payment gateway accounts.

      Currently
      [Stripe][stripe],
      [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/),
      [Authorize.net](https://www.authorize.net/),
      [CyberSource](https://www.cybersource.com/),
      [Zuora](https://www.zuora.com/), and
      [Elavon](https://www.elavon.com/)
      are the supported payment gateways.

      ### How Payments Work

      To make a request for payment,
      use a [`formulaTab`][formulatab]
      that has a
      [`paymentDetails`][paymentdetails] object.
      This object includes
      a list of [`paymentLineItem`][paymentlineitem] objects.
      Each line item refers to a [`number`][numbertab] tab
      that contains the value of the each item.
      The purpose of the line items
      is to transmit them to the payment gateway
      as metadata, so that you can use the information
      in the payment processor.

      **Note:** If the `fileExtension` parameter is not added in an API call, only base64 converted PDF files will be accepted.
      Any attempt to send a non-PDF file without using `fileExtension` results in an error.

      This is an example request for two books.
      Each book is specified in the `number` tabs
      labeled "Hamlet" and "Tempest".
      The books are referenced as line items
      by their tab labels
      within the `paymentDetails` object
      of a `formula` tab.
      The formula of the `formula` tab
      add the values of the same two `number` tabs.

      **Note:** This example uses US dollars, a decimal currency,
      so the price is multiplied
      by 100. If you are using a zero-decimal currency,
      such as Japanese yen, _do not_ multiply by 100.

      Use the

      to check the status of a payment.
      When the payment is successful,
      the `status` property of
      the [`paymentDetails`][paymentdetails] object
      is `payment_complete`.

      #### How to make a request for future payments

      Use the following steps to make a request to collect a signer's payment method for future use:

      1. Add a text tab with a descriptive `tabLabel` such as `FuturePayment`.
      2. In the formula tab's `paymentDetails` object, add a `lineItem` object that references the `tabLabel` from step 1.

      **Note:** Do not include this new `lineItem` in formula calculations.

      The following example builds on the previous code block to also collect a payment method for future use:

      ```

      ### Some Things to Keep in Mind About Payments

      * An envelope is not completed until all payments are completed.

      * If you are using a a decimal currency, such as USD,
        remember to multiply amounts by 100. If you are using
        zero-decimal currency, such as JPY, _do not_ multiply by 100.

      * If a DocuSign account Administrator
        deletes a payment gateway account connection
        DocuSign cancels all in-process envelopes
        that reference the deleted payment gateway account.

      * If the sender voids an envelope,
        all payment authorizations are canceled.

      * If a required recipient refuses to sign,
        all authorized payments are canceled.

      * If a required recipient's payment fails authorization,
        DocuSign attempts to recover
        by sending the recipient
        notification about the failed payment authorization.
        The recipient has the opportunity
        to correct the payment method information.

      * Each recipient's payment is authorized separately.
        Accounts are charged and payment made
        after all required tabs are completed,
        and all payments in an envelope for all recipients are authorized.

      * Refunds are not supported.
        Conduct refunds or payment changes
        with the payment gateway separately from DocuSign.

      * At this time, DocuSign does not charge a per-transaction fee.

      ## Using Custom Tabs in Envelopes and Templates

      Custom Tabs can be added to envelopes and templates
      by setting the `customTabId` property
      when creating an envelope or template recipient
      or when adding a new tab for an existing recipient.
      The custom tab must be added as the correct tab type.
      For example if the custom tab type is text, it cannot be used as a number tab.

      When the `customTabId` property is set,
      the new tab inherits all the custom tab properties.
      Required information that is not included in the custom tab,
      such as document ID and page ID, must be included when adding the tab.
      If the custom tab does not have anchor settings, the X and Y positions must be included.

      After the tab is created,
      it is treated as any other tab for updating or deleting.

      ## Anchoring Tabs

      The tab anchoring option
      allows you to send documents for signature
      that do not have a fixed layout or format.
      In these documents you might not know
      the absolute location of the tabs
      when you design your API client application because the tabs must move with text.
      As an alternative to sending X and Y coordinates for tabs,
      the DocuSign Service can derive an anchor location for the tab
      by correlating anchor information to data within the document.

      When the DocuSign Service receives a request that contains tabs
      with anchor information,
      it searches the document for instances of the `anchorString` property.
      When found,
      it places a tab of the specified type for the designated recipient.
      Tab positions are established by setting offsets for the tab.

      When you apply tabs to the document,
      DocuSign does not remove or replace the text in the `anchorString` property. You can hide codified anchors by using the same font color as the background of the document. So the anchor can be used by DocuSign processes and it will not be visible on the document.

      To use an anchoring option:

      1. Identify the location in the document by text string. You can use a pre-existing text string or add a new one.
      For best performance DocuSign recommends using single word anchor strings when possible, especially when there are a large number of pages in the envelope.
      For example, you might want to add a Sign Here tab to the "Borrower's Signature" lines in a document, but that phrase might occur in places in the document where you don't want to tab to appear. In this case, you could add the text "BorrowerSignHere" in white font color (so that isn't visible in the document) to all the places you want Sign Here tabs to appear and use "BorrowerSignHere" as the anchor string.
      1. Reference the anchor through the `anchorString` property of the tab.
      1. Determine the offset from the anchor string location to where the tab should be placed.

      Setting a positive value in the `anchorXOffset` property moves the tab right on the page and positive values in the  `anchorYoffset` prove moves the tab down the page. The `anchorUnits` property specifies the units used for the offsets.
      For Sign Here and Initial Here tabs the bottom-left of the anchor string is equivalent to position (0,0), and the bottom-left of the tab graphic is placed relative to that.
      For all other tabs the bottom-left of the anchor string is equivalent to position (0,0), and the top-left of the tab graphic is placed relative to that.
      DocuSign does not currently provide tools to derive the offset values. Determination of the proper offset will likely require some trial-and-error.

      ### Rules for working with anchor tags

      When anchor tabs are used, all documents in the envelope are searched for the `anchorString` property.

      * You set the text of the anchor string in the `anchorString` property. DocuSign tabs are created for each instance of the `anchorString` property within the document, so special care must be taken to establish unique anchor strings that do not result in unintentional tabs.
      * You cannot use the same anchored tab for different recipients for the same document.
      * The DocuSign system cannot search for text that is embedded in an image when checking for anchor strings.
      * X or Y offsets supplied for a tab apply to all instances of the tab in the document. To use different offsets at different locations in the document for the same recipient, create multiple, unique anchor tabs.
      * If the Y offset value of an anchor string would force a tab outside of the page boundaries, the tag is placed at the page boundary. If the X offset value places a tab outside of the page boundaries, the error message `Invalid_User_Offset` is sent. The error message includes the X offset that resulted in the error.
      * The system does not support an anchor string embedded in the form of a PDF X-object in the document.
      * The system does not re-flow the text that surrounds the anchor tabs. It is the responsibility of the document author to provide sufficient white space to contain the potential width of the ultimate tab value.

      ### Tips and Tricks

      The following are tips for effective use of anchor tags:
      * In order to avoid unintentional conflicts between text contained in an `anchorString` property and the text that naturally exists in documents, establish a codified syntax for the anchor string text that is unlikely to appear elsewhere in a document.
      * Develop an extensible and consistent syntax that can be used across multiple document types.
      * Especially for documents that have variable numbers of tabs or signers, author the source document to include hidden anchor tabs for all potential signers/permutations. Then, control the tabs that are actually placed by including/excluding the anchor tabs in the request. This approach allows a single document to be used for all use cases instead of maintaining separate documents for each scenario.

      ## Automatically Populating Tabs

      If you want similar tab types
      to automatically populate with the same data,
      you must follow these guidelines:

      * Each `tabLabel` entry must have the characters
        `\\*` in front of the label.
        If you omit the `\\*` prefix,
        only the first occurrence of the tab is populated.

        When automatically populating tabs,
        the `tabLabel` must not contain any spaces.
        In the JSON example below,
        the Text tabs  properties `StudentLastName` and `StudentFirstName`
        will be auto-populated as specified ("Doe" and "John")
        each place they appear throughout the envelope.

        ```
        "tabs": {
          "textTabs": [
          {
            "tabLabel": "\\*StudentLastName",
            "value": "Doe"
          },
          {
            "tabLabel": "\\*StudentFirstName",
            "value": "John"
          }]
        }
        ```

      * Note that `\\*` matches _anything_.  If you were to add
        another tab with the `tabLabel` set to `\\*Name` to the
        example above, it would end up matching the other two
        labels as well.

      * Each occurrence of the tab must have identical properties.

        For example, suppose there are two Text tabs in a document,
        each with `tabLabel` set to `Name`.
        If one tab has the `bold` property set to **true,**
        and the other has the `bold` property set to **false,**
        only the first one will be populated.
        In order to automatically populate both occurrences
        of the `Name` Text tabs,
        the `bold` property must be set to the same value for both tabs.

      Standards-Based Signatures (SBS) is the label used to describe DocuSign's suite of signatures that comply with regional and industry regulations, such as the electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services (eIDAS) regulation in Europe.

      ## Feature Differences When Using Standards-Based Signatures

      Some DocuSign features are not compatible with Standards-Based Signatures, while others work somewhat differently. It's important to understand these key differences.

      ### DocuSign Features Not Compatible with SBS

      - Attachment by fax
      - Concatenation of signer attachments
      - Legacy digital signatures
      - Markup
      - Notary

      ### DocuSign Features That Change with SBS

      The following features work slightly differently with SBS:

      - **Advanced Correct:** After the first signature, adding or deleting a field is not allowed. This behavior occurs because SBS does not allow adding or removing form fields after a digital signature has already been applied to a PDF.
      - **Downloading Combined Envelopes:** A combined PDF is not digitally signed. This behavior occurs because concatenating digitally signed PDFs breaks the digital signatures on the PDFs.
      - **Freeform Signing:** After someone has signed, allows only signature and initials on free-form. This behavior occurs because if another signer has already signed the document, adding fields other than signature fields will break the existing digital signatures on the document.
      - **Watermarks:** All watermarks are added as PDF annotations. This behavior occurs because burning the watermark into the PDF will break the digital signatures on the document.
      - **Wet Signing:** Wet-signed documents are added as new documents to envelopes. This behavior results in the uploaded or faxed, physically signed document being added as a new document to the envelope. This new document gets only a platform seal.

      The `ConnectConfigurations` resource enables you to configure the
      DocuSign Connect service for your account.

      You can use this resource to configure account-level webhooks
      that send notifications about every envelope sent from your
      account. You can set account-level webhooks to listen for events
      for envelopes sent by a specific user on your account, by
      multiple specific users, or from any of the users on your
      account. These events will be tracked, and can be delivered to a
      listening application.

      **Note:** To create an envelope-level webhook instead of using
      account-level webhooks, use the Envelopes::Create method and add
      an `eventNotification` object to an envelope object.


      DocuSign Connect offers two delivery modes:

      - Send Individual Messages
      - Send Aggregated Messages

      By default, the Send Individual Messages mode
      is enabled.
      You can disable it
      (enabling Aggregated Messages mode)
      through DocuSign Admin
      in the **Updates** section.


      **Note:** In either mode, Connect
      [must be enabled](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/ndse-admin-guide-connect)
      in your DocuSign account. It is not enabled by default.


      ## Send Individual Messages

      Send Individual Messages (SIM) mode is the default.

      In this mode DocuSign delivers notifications for each
      envelope events individually.
      When a final recipient completes an envelope,
      your listener will receive
      a single **Recipient Signed/Completed** event
      followed by a single **Envelope Signed/Completed** event
      for the final participating party on the agreement.

      ## Aggregated Messages

      In Aggregated Messages mode,
      Connect aggregates similar events
      into a single delivery.
      Similar or simultaneous events
      are aggregated,
      so that your listener doesn't
      receive extraneous messages.

      When the final recipient signs an envelope,  the
      system delivers a single, aggregated Connect event, rather than
      separate Recipient: complete and Envelope: complete messages.
      This aggregation process ensures that you only receive the
      minimal viable number of messages about an envelope's life cycle.

      The CustomTabs resource provides methods that allow you create and manage custom tabs based on the existing DocuSign tabs.

      You can create a tab with pre-defined properties, such as a text tab with a certain font type and validation pattern. Users can access the custom tabs when sending documents through the DocuSign web application.

      Custom tabs can be created based on the  approve, checkbox, company, date, date signed, decline, email, email address, envelope ID, first name, formula, full name, initial here, last name, list, note, number, radio, sign here, signer attachment, SSN, text, title, and zip tabs.

      The RequestLogs resource provide methods that allow you to retrieve and delete the API request log files.

      The log files contain the API requests associated with your integration. They can aid you in troubleshooting specific issues within an integration, or if DocuSign Support requests an API trace log.

      The `EnvelopeConsumerDisclosures` resource provides methods that enable you to retrieve the Electronic Record and Signature Disclosure (ERSD) for an envelope recipient. This is the disclosure that displays to each new recipient who is going to sign or add other information, or who is required to view the documents you send to them. The recipient must read and agree to the terms of the disclosure before they can access and take action on the documents you send. The ERSD does not apply to copy-only recipients, but does apply to recipients who must sign or view your documents.

      You can retrieve either the default ERSD that DocuSign provides for U.S.-based transactions, or a custom ERSD.

      ## Languages

      You specify the language of the disclosure version that you want to retrieve by using the `langCode` parameter.

      **Important:** The system does not translate the ERSD for you. An account administrator must create a version of the account-level disclosure for each language that your signers use.

      The EnvelopeDocuments resource provides methods
      that manage documents in an envelope.
      You can:
      * add one or more documents to the envelope
      * retrieve one or more documents from the envelope
      * delete documents from the envelope

      All of the methods in this resource
      operate on on an existing envelope.
      Before you can add documents
      to an envelope,
      you must first create it
      with the [Envelopes: create][envelopescreate] method.

      The EnvelopeEmailSettings provide methods that allow you to manage the email override settings for an envelope.

      Email override settings change the reply to email address, name, or the BCC for email archive information, for the envelope. Note that changing email settings will only affect email communications that occur after the addition was made.

      The BCC Email address feature is designed to provide a copy of all email communications for external archiving purposes. DocuSign recommends that envelopes sent using the BCC for Email Archive feature, including the BCC Email Override option, include additional signer authentication options. To send a copy of the envelope to a recipient who does not need to sign, use a Carbon Copies or Certified Deliveries Recipient Type.

      The Envelope resource provides methods that allow you to manipulate and monitor envelopes. 

      Once you have authenticated the user you can use the Envelopes: createEnvelope method to create an envelope. You can call the EnvelopeDocuments: update or EnvelopeDocuments: updateList method to add additional documents.

      Setting the `status` property on the envelope to `sent` allows you to send it or `created` to save it as a draft.

      You can receive envelope event notifications by setting the `eventNotification` properties. When the envelope or recipient status changes to one of the specified status codes, a notification is sent to a URL that you specify.

      If you have an envelope that you have previously saved, you can modify the subject and message, send it, void it, or place it in the purge queue using the Envelope: update method.

      In addition to receiving notifications you can monitor the status of the envelopes using the following methods:
      * Envelope: getEnvelope - To get the status of a envelope. 
      * Envelope: listStatus - To get the envelope status for a set of envelopes.
      * Envelope: listStatusChanges - To get status changes information for one or more envelopes. 

      If you need to delete a page from a document in an envelope, use the Envelope: deleteDocumentPage method.

      The resource also includes a number of methods that allow you to retrieve and set the initials and signature for certain types of recipients on the document.

      The Groups resource provides methods that allow you to manage groups for the account.

      Groups can be used to help manage users by associating users with a group. A group can be associated with a Permission Profile, which sets the user permissions for users in that group without having to set the `userSettings` property for each user. You are not required to set Permission Profiles for a group, but this makes it easier to manage user permissions for a large number of users. Groups can also be used with template sharing to limit user access to templates.

      The SigningGroups resource provides methods that allow you manage signing groups.

      Signing Groups allow you to create a group of people to which an envelope is sent. Any member of that group can open an envelope and sign the documents in the envelope with their own signature, even though a signature field was not directly assigned to them. When the Signing Group option is used, group members that open and sign the envelope are tracked in the envelope history and certificate.

      When one group member opens the envelope, it is temporarily locked and if other members try to open the envelope they will see a message saying the envelope is currently opened. If the group member exits the envelope without finishing the lock expires, allowing other group members to open and complete the envelope.

      When the envelope is complete, all members of the group will receive a completed notification and can access the completed envelope. 
      The envelope history and Certificate of Completion will show that the envelope was sent to a signing group and record which members viewed and signed the envelope.

      An account can have a maximum of 50 signing groups. Each signing group can have a maximum of 50 group members.

      The Signing Groups feature is only supported in certain DocuSign Enterprise and System Automated Premium plans. Your account might not support this option. To access this functionality, contact your Account Manager or DocuSign Support (support@docusign.com) for assistance.

      The TemplateRecipients resource allows you manage the recipients of an template.

      The exact parameters associated with a recipient depend on the recipient type. There are seven recipient types: Agents, Carbon Copies, Certified Deliveries, Editors, In Person Signers, Intermediaries, and Signers.

      Not all recipients are are available to all account types, review you account plan to determine which recipient types are available to you. If you are working in the development environment, all recipient types are available.

      Each recipient type is described below:

      [Agents](#agents): This recipient can add name and email information for recipients that appear after the recipient in routing order.

      [Carbon Copies](#carboncopies): Use this action if the recipient should get a copy of the template, but the recipient does not need to sign, initial, date or add information to any of the documents. This type of recipient can be placed in any order in the recipient list. The recipient receives a copy of the template when the template reaches the recipient's order in the process flow and when the template is completed.

      [Certified Deliveries](#certifiedDeliveries): Use this action if the recipient must receive the completed documents for the template to be completed, but the recipient does not need to sign, initial, date or add information to any of the documents.

      [Editors](#editors): This recipient has the same management and access rights for the template as the sender and can make changes to the template as if they were using the Advanced Correct feature. This recipient can add name and email information, add or change the routing order and set authentication options for the remaining recipients. Additionally, this recipient can edit signature/initial tabs and data fields for the remaining recipients. The recipient must have a DocuSign account to be an editor.

      [In Person Signers](#inPerson): Use this action if the signer is in the same physical location as a DocuSign user who will act as a Signing Host for the transaction. The recipient added is the Signing Host and new separate Signer Name field appears after Sign in person is selected.

      [Intermediaries](#intermediaries): This recipient can, but is not required to, add name and email information for recipients at the same or subsequent level in the routing order (until subsequent Agents, Editors or Intermediaries recipient types are added).

      [Signers](#signers): Use this action if your recipient must sign, initial, date or add data to form fields on the documents in the template.

      ### Core Recipient Parameters

      The following table contains the descriptions for the core properties for a recipient.

      | Name | Required? | Schema Type | Description |
      | --- | --- | --- | --- |
      | email | Yes | Email | Email of the recipient. Notification will be sent to this email id.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters. |
      | name | Yes | String | Full legal name of the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters. |
      | accessCode | No | String | This optional element specifies the access code a recipient has to enter to validate the identity.<br/>Maximum Length: 50 characters. |
      | addAccessCodeToEmail | No | Boolean | This optional attribute indicates that the access code is added to the email sent to the recipient; this nullifies the Security measure of Access Code on the recipient. |
      | clientUserId | No | String | This specifies whether the recipient is embedded or remote.<br/><br/>If the `clientUserId` property is not null then the recipient is embedded. Note that if the `ClientUserId` property is set and either `SignerMustHaveAccount` or `SignerMustLoginToSign` property of the account settings is set to  **true,** an error is generated on sending. |
      | embeddedRecipientStartURL | No | String | This is a sender provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would, but when the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to this URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, it is up to the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) to then request a recipient token to launch a signing session.<br/><br/>If the value `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN` is used for this node, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation that would be launched by any partner.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application and DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the sending application sets  the `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL` property to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) be used to verify the identity of the recipient.<br/><br>If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` property is set, DocuSign ignores the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` property using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: templateId, recipientId, recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The customFields must be part of the recipient or template. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets.<br/><br/>_Example_:<br/>`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]` |
      | customFields | No | customField |An optional array of strings that allows the sender to provide custom data about the recipient. This information is returned in the template status but otherwise not used by DocuSign. String `customField` properties have a maximum length of 100 characters. |
      | emailNotification | No | emailNotification | An optional complex type that has information for setting the language for the recipient's email information. It is composed of three elements:<br/><br/>*emailBody*: a string with the email message sent to the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length: 10000 characters.<br/><br/>*emailSubject*: a string with the subject of the email sent to the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters.<br/><br/>*supportedLanguage*: The simple type enumeration of the language used. The supported languages, with the language value shown in parenthesis, are: Arabic (ar), Bahasa Indonesia (id), Bahasa Melayu (ms) Bulgarian (bg), Czech (cs), Chinese Simplified (zh_CN), Chinese Traditional (zh_TW), Croatian (hr), Danish (da), Dutch (nl), English US (en), English UK (en_GB), Estonian (et), Farsi (fa), Finnish (fi), French (fr), French Canada (fr_CA), German (de), Greek (el), Hebrew (he), Hindi (hi), Hungarian (hu), Italian (it), Japanese (ja), Korean (ko), Latvian (lv), Lithuanian (lt), Norwegian (no), Polish (pl), Portuguese (pt), Portuguese Brazil (pt_BR), Romanian (ro),Russian (ru), Serbian (sr), Slovak (sk), Slovenian (sl), Spanish (es),Spanish Latin America (es_MX), Swedish (sv), Thai (th), Turkish (tr), Ukrainian (uk) and Vietnamese (vi).<br/><br/>**IMPORTANT:** If this is enabled for one recipient, it overrides the Template Subject and `EmailBlurb` property settings. Also, you must set the  `emailNotification` property for all recipients. |
      | excludedDocuments | No | Array of Strings | Specifies the documents that are not visible to this recipient. Document Visibility must be enabled for the account and the enforceSignerVisibility property must be set to true for the template to use this.<br/><br/>When the enforceSignerVisibility property is set to **true,** documents with tabs can only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document. Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an template, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an template is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an template is sent. |
      | idCheckConfigurationName | No | String |Specifies authentication check by name. The names used here must be the same as the authentication type names used by the account (these name can also be found in the web console sending interface in the Identify list for a recipient). This overrides any default authentication setting.<br/><br/>_Example_:<br/> Your account has ID Check and SMS Authentication available and in the web console Identify list these appear as 'ID Check $' and 'SMS Auth $'. To use ID check in an template, the `idCheckConfigurationName` property must be  set to `ID Check $`. To use SMS, it must be set to `SMS Auth $` and you must add phone number information to the `smsAuthentication` node.|
      | iDCheckInformationInput | No | IdCheckInformationInput | This complex element contains input information related to a recipient ID check. It can include the following information.<br/><br/>*addressInformationInput*: Used to set recipient address information and consists of:<br/><br/>*addressInformation*: consists of six elements, with street2 and zipPlus4 being optional. The elements are: street1, street2, city, state, zip, zipPlus4\. The maximum number of characters in each element are: street1/street2 = 150 characters, city = 50 characters, state = 2 characters, and zip/zipPlus4 = 20 characters.<br/><br/>displayLevelCode: Specifies the display level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable, or DoNotDisplay.<br/><br/>*receiveInResponse*: A Boolean element that specifies if the information needs to be returned in the response.<br/><br/>*dobInformationInput*: Used to set recipient date of birth information and consists of:<br/><br/>*dateOfBirth*: Specifies the recipient's date, month and year of birth.<br/><br/>*displayLevelCode*: Specifies the display level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable, or DoNotDisplay.<br/><br/>*receiveInResponse*: A Boolean element that specifies if the information needs to be returned in the response.<br/><br/>*ssn4InformationInput*: Used to set the last four digits of the recipient's SSN information and consists of:<br/><br/>*ssn4*: Specifies the last four digits of the recipient's SSN.<br/><br/>*displayLevelCode*: Specifies the display level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable, or DoNotDisplay.<br/><br/>*receiveInResponse*: A Boolean element that specifies if the information needs to be returned in the response.<br/><br/>*ssn9InformationInput*: Used to set the recipient's SSN information. Note that the ssn9 information can never be returned in the response. The ssn9 input consists of:<br/><br/><br/><br/>*ssn9*: Specifies the recipient's SSN.<br/><br/>*displayLevelCode*: Specifies the display level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable, or DoNotDisplay. |
      | inheritEmailNotificationConfiguration | No | Boolean | Optional element. If true and the template recipient creates a DocuSign account after signing, the Manage Account Email Notification settings are used as the default settings for the recipient's account. |
      | note | No | String | A note that is unique to this recipient. This note is sent to the recipient via the signing email. The note displays in the signing UI near the upper left corner of the document on the signing screen.<br/>Maximum Length: 1000 characters. |
      | phoneAuthentication | No | RecipientPhoneAuthentication | Optional element. Contains the elements: <br/><br/> *recipMayProvideNumber*:Boolean. When **true** thenrecipient can use whatever phone number they choose to.<br/><br/> *senderProvidedNumbers*: ArrayOfString. A list of phone numbers the recipient can use. <br/><br/>*recordVoicePrint* - Reserved <br/><br/>*validateRecipProvidedNumber* - Reserved| |
      | recipientAttachment | No | Attachment | Reserved |
      | recipientId | No | String | Unique for the recipient. It is used by the tab element to indicate which recipient is to sign the Document. |
      | requireIdLookup | No | Boolean | When **true,** the recipient is required to use the specified ID check method (including Phone and SMS authentication) to validate their identity. |
      | roleName | No* | String | Optional element. Specifies the role name associated with the recipient.<br/><br/>This is required when working with template recipients. |
      | routingOrder | Yes | String | This element specifies the routing order of the recipient in the template. |

      | templateLocked | No | Boolean | Optional element. Used only when working with template recipients. When **true,** the sender cannot change any attributes of the recipient. |
      | templateRequired | No | Boolean | Optional element. Used only when working with template recipients. When **true,**  the sender may not remove the recipient. |

      ## <a name="agents"></a> Agents Recipient

      This recipient can add name and email information for recipients that appear after the recipient in routing order.

      #### Example Agents layout

      ```
      "agents": [{
       <core parameters>
        "canEditRecipientEmails": false,
        "canEditRecipientNames": false
      }],
      ```

      The additional parameters for Agents recipient are shown below:

      | Name | Required? | Schema Type | Description |
      | --- | --- | --- | --- |
      | canEditRecipientEmails | No | Boolean | Optional element. When **true,** the Agents Recipient associated with this Recipient can change the Recipient's pre-populated Email address. This element is only active if enabled for the account. |
      | canEditRecipientNames | No | Boolean | Optional element. When **true,** the Agents Recipient associated with this recipient can change the recipient's pre-populated name (`UserName`). This element is only active if enabled for the account. |

      ## <a name="carbonCopies"></a>Carbon Copies Recipient

      Use this type if the recipient should get a copy of the template, but the recipient does not need to sign, initial, date, or add information to any of the documents. This type of recipient can be placed in any order in the recipient list. The recipient receives a copy of the template when the template reaches the recipient's order in the process flow and when the template is completed.

      #### Example Carbon Copies layout

      ```
      "carbonCopies": [{
       <core parameters>
      ```

      The Carbon Copies recipient uses only the core parameters.

      ## <a name="certifiedDeliveries"></a>Certified Deliveries Recipient

      Use this action if the recipient must receive the completed documents for the template to be completed, but the recipient does not need to sign, initial, date, or add information to any of the documents.

      #### Example Certified Deliveries layout

      ```
      "certifiedDeliveries": [{
      <core parameters>

      The Certified Deliveries recipient uses only the core parameters.

      ## <a name="editors"></a>Editors Recipient

      This recipient has the same management and access rights for the template as the sender and can make changes to the template as if they were using the Advanced Correct feature. This recipient can add name and email information, add or change the routing order and set authentication options for the remaining recipients. Additionally, this recipient can edit signature/initial tabs and data fields for the remaining recipients. The recipient must have a DocuSign account to be an editor.

      #### Example Editors layout

      ```
      "editors": [{
       <core parameters>
        "canEditRecipientEmails": false,
        "canEditRecipientNames": false
      }],
      ```

      The additional parameters for Editors recipient are shown below:

      | Name | Required? | Schema Type | Description |
      | --- | --- | --- | --- |

      ## Tab Types

      This table lists the available tab types.

      <br>


      | Tab Type              | Description |
      | :-------              | :---------- |
      | Approve Tab           | Place this tab on the document if you want the recipient to approve documents in an envelope without placing a signature or initials on the document. If the recipient clicks the Approve tab during the signing process, the recipient is considered to have signed the document. No information is shown on the document for the approval, but it is recorded as a signature in the envelope history. |
      | Checkbox Tab          | Place this tab on the document in a location where the recipient can select a yes/no (on/off) type option. |
      | Company Tab           | Place this tab on the document where you want the recipient's company name to appear. |
      | Date Signed Tab       | Place this tab on the document where you want the date the recipient signed the document to appear. |
      | Date Tab              | Place this tab on the document where you want the recipient to enter a date. Date tabs are single-line fields that allow date information to be entered in any format. The tooltip for this tab recommends entering the date as MM/DD/YYYY, but this is not enforced. The format entered by the signer is retained. If you need a particular date format enforced, DocuSign recommends using a Text tab with a Validation Pattern and Validation Message to enforce the format. |
      | Decline Tab           | Place this tab on the document where you want to give the recipient the option of declining an envelope. If the recipient clicks the Decline tab during the signing process, the envelope is voided. |
      | Email Address Tab     | Place this tab on a document where you want the recipient's email, as entered in the recipient information, to appear. |
      | Email Tab             | This is a single-line field that accepts all characters. |
      | Envelope ID Tab       | Place this tab on the document where you want the envelope ID for to appear. Recipients cannot enter or change the information in this tab. It is for informational purposes only. |
      | First Name Tab        | Place this tab on a document where you want the recipient's first name to appear. This tab splits the recipient's name (as entered in the recipient information) into sections based on spaces and uses the first section as the first name. |
      | Formula Tab           | This tab is used to add a calculated field to a document. Envelope recipients cannot directly enter information into the tab. The formula tab calculates and displays a new value when changes are made to the reference tab values. The reference tab information and calculation operations are entered in the "formula" element. See the Using the Calculated Fields Feature quick start guide or DocuSign Service User Guide for more information about formulas.  |
      | Full Name Tab         | Place this tab on the document where you want the recipient's full name to appear. |
      | Initial Here Tab      | Place this tab where the recipient must initial the document. This tab can be set to be optional.  |
      | Last Name Tab         | Place this tab on a document where you want the recipient's last name to appear. This tab splits the recipient's name (as entered in the recipient information) into sections based on spaces and uses the last section as the last name. |
      | List Tab              | This tab has a list of options that a recipient can select. The `listItems` parameter is used to set the options that can be selected.  |
      | Note Tab              | Place this tab on the document where you want to add a note for the recipient on a document. |
      | Number Tab            | This tab is a field where the recipient can enter numbers and decimal (.) points.  |
      | Radio Group Tab       | This group tab is used to place radio buttons on a document. The `radios` parameter is used to add and place the radio buttons associated with the group. Only one radio button can be selected in a group.  |
      | Sign Here Tab         | Place this tab where the recipient must sign the document. This tab can be set to be optional.  |
      | Signer Attachment Tab | The signer attachment is where the recipient initiates the process of adding supporting documents to an envelope. |
      | SSN Tab               | This tab is a single-line field where the recipient can enter numbers. A Social Security Number can be typed with or without dashes. |
      | Text Tab              | This tab is a field where the recipient can enter any type of characters.  |
      | Title Tab             | Place this tab on the document where you want the recipient's title to appear. |
      | Zip Tab               | This tab is a single-line field where the recipient can enter numbers. |


      ## Using Custom Tabs in Envelopes and Templates 

      Custom Tabs can be added to envelopes and templates
      by setting the `customTabId` property
      when creating an envelope or template recipient
      or when adding a new tab for an existing recipient.
      The custom tab must be added as the correct tab type.
      For example if the custom tab type is text, it cannot be used as a number tab.

      When the `customTabId` property is set,
      the new tab inherits all the custom tab properties.
      Required information that is not included in the custom tab,
      such as document ID and page ID, must be included when adding the tab.
      If the custom tab does not have anchor settings, the X and Y positions must be included.

      After the tab is created,
      it is treated as any other tab for updating or deleting. 

      ## Anchoring Tabs

      The tab anchoring option
      allows you to send documents for signature
      that do not have a fixed layout or format.
      In these documents you might not know
      the absolute location of the tabs
      when you design your API client application because the tabs must move with text.
      As an alternative to sending X and Y coordinates for tabs,
      the DocuSign Service can derive an anchor location for the tab
      by correlating anchor information to data within the document.

      When the DocuSign Service receives a request that contains tabs
      with anchor information,
      it searches the document for instances of the `anchorString` property.
      When found,
      it places a tab of the specified type for the designated recipient.
      Tab positions are established by setting offsets for the tab.

      When you apply tabs to the document,
      DocuSign does not remove or replace the text in the `anchorString` property. You can hide codified anchors by using the same font color as the background of the document. So the anchor can be used by DocuSign processes and it will not be visible on the document.

      To use an anchoring option:

      1. Identify the location in the document by text string. You can use a pre-existing text string or add a new one.
      For best performance DocuSign recommends using single word anchor strings when possible, especially when there are a large number of pages in the envelope. 
      For example, you might want to add a Sign Here tab to the "Borrower's Signature" lines in a document, but that phrase might occur in places in the document where you don't want to tab to appear. In this case, you could add the text "BorrowerSignHere" in white font color (so that isn't visible in the document) to all the places you want Sign Here tabs to appear and use "BorrowerSignHere" as the anchor string. 
      1. Reference the anchor through the `anchorString` property of the tab.
      1. Determine the offset from the anchor string location to where the tab should be placed. 

      Setting a positive value in the `anchorXOffset` property moves the tab right on the page and positive values in the  `anchorYoffset` prove moves the tab down the page. The `anchorUnits` property specifies the units used for the offsets.
      For Sign Here and Initial Here tabs the bottom-left of the anchor string is equivalent to position (0,0), and the bottom-left of the tab graphic is placed relative to that.
      For all other tabs the bottom-left of the anchor string is equivalent to position (0,0), and the top-left of the tab graphic is placed relative to that.
      DocuSign does not currently provide tools to derive the offset values. Determination of the proper offset will likely require some trial-and-error.

      ### Rules for working with anchor tags

      When anchor tabs are used, all documents in the envelope are searched for the `anchorString` property.

      * You set the text of the anchor string in the `anchorString` property. DocuSign tabs are created for each instance of the `anchorString` property within the document, so special care must be taken to establish unique anchor strings that do not result in unintentional tabs.
      * You cannot use the same anchored tab for different recipients for the same document.
      * The DocuSign system cannot search for text that is embedded in an image when checking for anchor strings.
      * X or Y offsets supplied for a tab apply to all instances of the tab in the document. To use different offsets at different locations in the document for the same recipient, create multiple, unique anchor tabs.
      * If the Y offset value of an anchor string would force a tab outside of the page boundaries, the tag is placed at the page boundary. If the X offset value places a tab outside of the page boundaries, the error message `Invalid_User_Offset` is sent. The error message includes the X offset that resulted in the error.
      * The system does not support an anchor string embedded in the form of a PDF X-object in the document.
      * The system does not re-flow the text that surrounds the anchor tabs. It is the responsibility of the document author to provide sufficient white space to contain the potential width of the ultimate tab value.

      ### Tips and Tricks

      The following are tips for effective use of anchor tags:
      * In order to avoid unintentional conflicts between text contained in an `anchorString` property and the text that naturally exists in documents, establish a codified syntax for the anchor string text that is unlikely to appear elsewhere in a document.
      * Develop an extensible and consistent syntax that can be used across multiple document types.
      * Especially for documents that have variable numbers of tabs or signers, author the source document to include hidden anchor tabs for all potential signers/permutations. Then, control the tabs that are actually placed by including/excluding the anchor tabs in the request. This approach allows a single document to be used for all use cases instead of maintaining separate documents for each scenario.

      ## Automatically Populating Tabs

      If you want similar tab types
      to automatically populate with the same data,
      you must follow these guidelines:

      * Each `tabLabel` entry must have the characters
        `\\*` in front of the label.
        If you omit the `\\*` prefix,
        only the first occurrence of the tab is populated.

        When automatically populating tabs,
        the `tabLabel` must not contain any spaces.
        In the JSON example below,
        the Text tabs  properties `StudentLastName` and `StudentFirstName`
        will be auto-populated as specified ("Doe" and "John")
        each place they appear throughout the envelope.

        ```
        "tabs": {
          "textTabs": [
          {
            "tabLabel": "\\*StudentLastName",
            "value": "Doe"
          },
          {
            "tabLabel": "\\*StudentFirstName",
            "value": "John"
          }]
        }
        ```

      * Each occurrence of the tab must have identical properties.

        For example, suppose there are two Text tabs in a document,
        each with `tabLabel` set to `Name`.
        If one tab has the `bold` property set to **true,**

      PowerForms enable you to create self-service documents for signature. A PowerForm is an envelope initiated from a URL that you make available for signers to complete. You can either add a PowerForm to your website or email the URL to recipients. DocuSign saves the data that recipients enter so  you can easily integrate it with your other applications.

      For more information, see [Using PowerForms](https://support.docusign.com/s/document-item?bundleId=jbx1643062255110&topicId=eke1578456649038.html).

      **Note:** PowerForms are available only for DocuSign Enterprise accounts.


      ### Errors

      PowerForm methods return the following 404 errors:

      - `PowerForms_Recipient_Denied_Documents`: The recipient is denied access to the documents.
      - `PowerForms_DigitalCerts_Shared_Tabs_Not_Allowed`: Shared tags are not allowed because a digital certificate is required
      for a signer.
      - `PowerForms_DigitalCerts_Free_Form_Tabs_Not_Allowed`: Signers that are required to use a digital certificate must have at
      least one required, non-conditional signature or initials tab.
      - `PowerForms_DigitalCerts_Multiple_Recipients_Routing_Order`: Signers that are required to use a digital certificate must be the
      only recipient in a routing order. Edit the routing order or remove the digital certificate requirement.
      - `PowerForms_DigitalCerts_Markup_Not_Allowed`: Document markup is not allowed because a digital certificate is
      required for a signer.
      - `PowerForms_Incomplete_Recipient`: The recipient's username, email, or role is not set.
      - `PowerForms_PowerFormId_Required`: A `powerFormId` is required.
      - `PowerForms_PowerFormId_Mismatch`: A `powerFormId` mismatch has occurred.

      A workspace is a collaborative space for sharing documents and managing workflows. A workspace has a single owner who must be a DocuSign user. The owner can invite others to the workspace as collaborators. Individuals who are not DocuSign users must create a DocuSign account to join a workspace as a collaborator.
       
      You can create an envelope directly from a workspace.

      Workspaces store the following information:

      - **Files:** Files uploaded to a workspace for storage or reuse.
      - **Documents:** A document is a component of a transaction, template, or workspace. When a file is added to a transaction, template, or workspace, it is copied as a document. Each document in a workspace has a single owner.
      - **Templates:** A set of documents that you can use to create a transaction or a workspace.
      - **Transactions:** A transaction is a series of workflow events related to one or more documents. These events route the documents to one or more individuals for the purposes of doing business. Each transaction has a single owner (the sender).

      **Note:** Documents in a template are not individually listed as files.

      A chunked upload is a temporary file that you upload in parts and stage at DocuSign, then refer to as the content for other API calls. For example, you might use it for document content when assembling an envelope or template. 

      A chunked upload is linked to the DocuSign account member who initiated the API call. This user is the only user who is able to reference the chunked upload.

      A ChunkedUpload is intended to be an area for briefly staging data for use with other DocuSign API calls. The ChunkedUpload API endpoints do not provide an action to download the ChunkedUpload's content.

      The typical flow for using a chunked upload involves the following steps:

      1) Initiate the chunked upload with content representing part 0.

      2) Add more parts to the chunked upload until you have transmitted the entirety of the content.

      3) Commit the chunked upload, preparing it for use with other API calls.

      4) Assemble a DocuSign envelope with a document that includes a reference to the chunked upload as the content.

      5) Continue with envelope-related processes.

      **Note:** You must fully upload and use a chunked upload within 20 minutes of initializing it.

      After the chunked upload has been correctly referenced within another API call, it becomes unavailable for any further use and is promptly removed from the system.

      Chunked uploads have the following limits, which are configured per DocuSign environment, account, or integrator:

      - The maximum number of all of a member's unexpired, unconsumed ChunkedUploads. The default value is 64. 
      - The maximum total size of all of a member's unexpired, unconsumed  ChunkedUploads. The default value is 1 GB. 
      - The amount of time that a chunked upload is active after you initialize it. The default value is 20 minutes.

      The DocuSign Identity Verification process requires a signer to submit an image of their valid government ID and wait for the image to be uploaded and verified before they can access a document.

      Identity Verification supports government photo IDs and European eIDs, analyzing the document security features and matching the name on the agreement against the name on the ID. After a successful verification, the signer can view the agreement and sign as usual.

      To use Identity Verification, the [DocuSign Identity Verification](https://www.docusign.com/products/identify) product must be enabled for your account.

        Creates new DocuSign accounts.
        You can use this method to create
        a single account
        or up to 100 accounts at a time.

        **Note:**  This method is restricted to partner integrations.
        You must work with DocuSign Professional Services
        or DocuSign Business Development,
        who will provide you with the Distributor Code
        and Distributor Password
        that you need to include in the request body.


        When creating a single account,
        the body of the request is a
        [`newAccountRequest`][newAccountRequest]
        object.

        Example:

        ```
        {
          "newAccountRequest": [
            {
              "accountName":"Test Account",
              "distributorCode":"MY_DIST_CODE",
              "distributorPassword":"MY_DIST_PWD",
              "initialUser":{
                "email":"user@emaildomain.com",
                "firstName":"John",
                "middleName": "Harry",
                "lastName":"Doe",
                "suffixName": "",
                "userName": "John Doe",
                "jobTitle": "Engineer",
                "company": "Test Company"
              },
              "addressInformation":{
                "address1": "1234 Main Street",
                "address2": "Suite 100",
                "city": "Seattle",
                "state": "WA",
                "postalCode": "98101",
                "country": "US",
                "phone": "1234567890",
                "fax": "1234567891"
              },
              "planInformation":{
                "planId":"37085696-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-7ea067752959"
              },
              "referralInformation":{
                "includedSeats": "1",
                "referralCode": "code",
                "referrerName": "name"
              }
            }
          ]
        }

        ```
        If the request succeeds,
        it returns a
        201 (Created) HTTP response code.
        The response returns the new account ID, password, and the default user
        information for each newly created account.


        When creating multiple accounts,
        the body of the request is a
        `newAccountRequests`
        object,
        which contains one or more
        [`newAccountDefinition`][newAccountDefinition]
        objects.
        You can create up to 100 new accounts
        at a time this way.

        The body for a multi-account
        creation request
        looks like this in JSON:

        ```
        {
          "newAccountRequests": [
            {
              "accountName": "accountone",
              . . .
            },
            {
              "accountName": "accounttwo",
              . . .
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        A multi-account request
        looks like this in XML:

        ```
        <newAccountsDefinition xmlns:i="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns="http://www.docusign.com/restapi">
          <newAccountRequests>
            <newAccountDefinition>
              . . .
            </newAccountDefinition>
            <newAccountDefinition>
              . . .
            </newAccountDefinition>
          </newAccountRequests>
        </newAccountsDefinition>
        ```

        A multi-account creation request
        may succeed (report a 201 code)
        even if some accounts could not be created.
        In this case, the `errorDetails` property
        in the response contains specific information
        about the failure.

        This method can only be used if the `paymentAllowed` value for a past due invoice is true. This can be determined calling [Billing::listInvoicesPastDue](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/billing/invoices/listpastdue/).

        The response returns information for a single payment
        if a payment ID was used in the endpoint, or a list of payments.
        If the from date or to date queries or payment ID are not used,
        the response returns payment information for the last 365 days.

        If the request was for a single payment ID, the `nextUri` and `previousUri` properties are not returned.

        Response

        The response returns the billing plan information, including the currency code, for the plan. The `billingPlan` and `succesorPlans` property values are the same as those shown in the [Billing: getBillingPlan](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/billing/billingplans/get/) reference. the `billingAddress` and `creditCardInformation` property values are the same as those shown in the [Billing: updatePlan](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/billing/billingplans/update/) reference.

        **Note:** When credit card number information displays, a mask is applied to the response so that only the last 4 digits of the card number are visible.

        A brand uses a set of brand resource files to control the sending, signing, email message, and captive (embedded) signing experiences.  You can modify the default email messages and formats in these files and upload them to your brand to customize the user experience.

        **Important:** When you upload a modified resource file, only the elements that differ from the master resource file are saved as your resource file. Similarly, when you download your resource files, only the modified elements are included in the file.

        This method initiates the bulk send process. It generates a bulk send request based on an [existing bulk send list][create_list] and an envelope or template.

        Consider using the [BulkSend::createBulkSendTestRequest][create_test] method to test your bulk send list for compatibility with the envelope or template that you want to send first. To learn about the complete bulk send flow, see the [Bulk Send overview][BulkSendOverview].

        If the envelopes were successfully queued for asynchronous processing, the response contains a `batchId` that you can use to get the status of the batch. If a failure occurs, the API returns an error message.

        **Note:** Partial success or failure generally does not occur. Only the entire batch is queued for asynchronous processing.

        This method tests a bulk send list for compatibility with the envelope or template that you want to send. For example, a template that has three roles is not compatible with a bulk send list that has only two recipients. For this reason, you might want to test compatibility first.

        A successful test result returns `true` for the `canBeSent` property. An unsuccessful test returns a JSON response that contains information about the errors that occurred.

        If the test is successful, you can then send the envelope or template by using the [BulkSend::createBulkSendRequest][BulkSendRequest] method.

        ## Envelope Compatibility Checks

        This section describes the envelope compatibility checks that the system performs.

        **Top-Level Issues**

        - Envelopes must be in a sendable state.
        - The bulk send list must contain at least one copy (instance of an envelope), and no more than the maximum number of copies allowed for the account.
        - The envelope must not be null and must be visible to the current user.
        - The account cannot have more queued envelopes than the maximum number configured for the account.
        - The bulk send list must exist.

        **Recipients**

        - The envelope must have recipients.
        - If you are using an envelope, all of the recipients defined in the bulk send list must have corresponding recipient IDs in the envelope definition. If you are using a template, you must either match the recipient IDs or role IDs.
        - The envelope cannot contain a bulk recipient (an artifact of the legacy version of DocuSign's bulk send
          functionality).

        **Recipient Tabs**

        - Every `recipient ID, tab label` pair in the bulk send list must correspond to a tab in the envelope.

        **Custom Fields**

        - Each envelope-level custom field in the bulk send list must correspond to the name of a `customField` in the
          envelope definition. You do not have to match the recipient-level custom fields.

        Adds a chunk or part to an existing chunked upload. After you use the Create method to initiate a new chunked upload and upload the first part, 
        use this method to upload subsequent parts.

        For simplicity, DocuSign recommends that you upload the parts in their sequential order ( 1,2, 3, 4, etc.). The Create method adds the first part and assigns it the `sequence` value `0`. As a result, DocuSign recommends that you start with a `sequence` value of `1` when you use this method, and continue uploading parts contiguously until you have uploaded the entirety of the original content to DocuSign.

        Example:


        ```
        PUT /v2.1/accounts/{accountId}/chunked_uploads/{chunkedUploadId}/1
        PUT /v2.1/accounts/{accountId}/chunked_uploads/{chunkedUploadId}/2
        PUT /v2.1/accounts/{accountId}/chunked_uploads/{chunkedUploadId}/3
        ```

        **Note:** You cannot replace a part that DocuSign has already received, or add parts to a chunked upload that is already successfully committed.

        Creates a custom Connect configuration for the specified account.

        Connect is a webhook service that provides updates when certain events occur in your eSignature workflows. You can use this endpoint to create:
        * Account-level Connect configurations to listen for events related to any envelopes sent by one or more account users
        * Recipient Connect configurations that are triggered when one or more of your account users receive an envelope

        To set an account-level configuration, set `configurationType` to **custom.**
        To set a Recipient Connect configuration, set `configurationType` to **customrecipient.**

        If you want to listen for events on only one envelope, use the [eventNotification](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopes/create/#schema__envelopedefinition_eventnotification) object instead.

        **Note:** To use this function, you must be an account administrator and Connect must be enabled on your account.

        ## Data models

        There are four possible data models for your Connect configuration. Consider:
        * Do you want the data in JSON or XML?
        * Do you want events sent individually (SIM) or in aggregate?

        DocuSign recommends using the [JSON SIM event model](/platform/webhooks/connect/improved-json-sim-event-model/).

        <ds-column>

        <ds-step open="false" hideIcon="true">
        <h3>JSON SIM (Recommended)</h3>
        <div>

        Set `deliveryMode` to **SIM** and `eventData.version` to **restv2.1.** Use the `events` property to set the event statuses that will trigger your configuration.

        The following sample request shows how to create an envelope-level configuration using JSON SIM:
        ```
        {
          "configurationType": "custom",
          "urlToPublishTo": "YOUR-WEBHOOK-URL",

        ## Troubleshooting

        If your configuration is not working, check the following.

        * Connect must be enabled for your account to use this function.
        * If you are using `envelopeEvents` or `recipientEvents`, make sure that the event values are sentence case, not lowercase.
        * Make sure you have either set `allUsers` to **true** or set `userIds` to a non-empty array of IDs.
        * By default, this endpoint creates a disabled configuration. To enable the configuration immediately, set the body parameter `allowEnvelopePublish` to **true.** You can also enable the configuration in the UI.
        * To check if events are being emitted, set `enableLog` to **true** to view event logs in the Connect console.

        ## Related topics

        * For more information about Connect, see the [DocuSign Connect guide](/platform/webhooks/connect/).
        * Use the MyAPICalls sample app to see an [example of this endpoint](https://myapicalls.sampleapps.docusign.com/scenario/6) using the JSON SIM model.

        This endpoint submits a batch of existing envelopes to a webhook of your choice. Set the webhook address with the `urlToPublishTo` request body parameter.

        This endpoint does not call an existing Connect configuration or create a new Connect listener to monitor new activity. It simply uses an ad hoc configuration to submit existing envelopes. You must include all the configuration data in the request body.

        The envelope data will always be transmitted in JSON format. XML, Salesforce, and eOriginal configuration types are not supported.

        Your request should match the following format:

        ```
        {
            "envelopes": ["4280f274-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-b218b7eeda08", "8373a938-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-e992a2abae01"],
            "config": {
                "configurationType":"custom",
                "name": "Test",
                "urlToPublishTo":"YOUR-WEBHOOK-URL",
                "allowEnvelopePublish": "true",
                "enableLog": "true",
                "requiresAcknowledgement": "true",
                "IncludeHMAC": "true",
                "SignMessageWithX509Cert": "true",
                "deliveryMode": "SIM",
                "eventData": {
                    "version": "restv2.1",
                    "format": "json",
                    "includedata": ["tabs","payment_tabs","custom_fields","powerform","recipients","folde rs","extensions","attachments", "prefill_tabs", "documents"]
                }
            }
        }
        ```

        If the request succeeds, it returns a 201 (Created) HTTP response code and the response body property `processingStatus` will be set to `processing`. You can then view the status of each historical republish request in the [Bulk Actions Log](https://support.docusign.com/s/document-item?language=en_US&bundleId=pik1583277475390&topicId=nvf1648497452396.html&_LANG=enus).

        Sets up Connect OAuth for the specified account using an authorization server of your choice. To use this endpoint, get the client ID and client secret from your authorization server.

        When you call this endpoint, DocuSign requests an access token from your authorization server. DocuSign will use that token in the Authorization HTTP header of your account's Connect messages. Finally, your listener will be responsible for validating the token by calling the authorization server.

        **Note:** To use this function, you must be an account administrator and Connect must be enabled on your account.

        Account administrators can use this method to perform the following tasks:

        - Customize values in the default disclosure.
        - Switch to a custom disclosure that uses your own text and HTML formatting.
        - Change values in your existing consumer disclosure. 

        To specify the signer language version of the disclosure that you are updating, use the optional `langCode` query parameter.

        **Note:** Only account administrators can use this method. Each time you change the disclosure content, all unsigned recipients of outstanding documents will be required to accept a new version. 

        ## Updating the default disclosure

        When you update the default disclosure, you can edit all properties except for the following ones:

        - `accountEsignId`: This property is read-only.
        - `custom`: The default value is **false.** Editing this property causes the default disclosure to switch to a custom disclosure.
        - `esignAgreement`: This property is read-only.
        - `esignText`: You cannot edit this property when `custom` is set to **false.** The API returns a 200 OK HTTP response, but does not update the `esignText`.
        - Metadata properties: These properties are read-only.

        **Note:** The text of the default disclosure is always in English.

        ## Switching to a custom disclosure

        To switch to a custom disclosure, set the `custom` property to **true** and customize the value for the `eSignText` property. 

        You can also edit all of the other properties except for the following ones:

        - `accountEsignId`: This property is read-only.
        - `esignAgreement`: This property is read-only.
        - Metadata properties: These properties are read-only.

        **Note:** When you use a custom disclosure, you can create versions of it in different signer languages and se the `langCode` parameter to specify the signer language version that you are updating.

        **Important:**  When you switch from a default to a custom disclosure, note the following information:

        - You will not be able to return to using the default disclosure.
        - Only the disclosure for the currently selected signer language is saved. DocuSign will not automatically translate your custom disclosure. You must create a disclosure for each language that your signers use.

        ## Updating a custom disclosure

        When you update a custom disclosure, you can update all of the properties except for the following ones:

        - `accountEsignId`: This property is read-only. 
        - `esignAgreement`: This property is read-only.
        - Metadata properties: These properties are read-only.

        **Important:** Only the disclosure for the currently selected signer language is saved. DocuSign will not automatically translate your custom disclosure. You must create a disclosure for each language that your signers use.

        This method lets you
        [search for envelopes](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/envelopes/)
        in your accounts.
        A large set of filters let you narrow the scope of your search
        by date,
        by envelope ID,
        or by status codes.
        Your request must include one or more of the following parameters:

        * `from_date`
        * `envelope_ids`
        * `transaction_ids`


        To avoid unnecessary database queries, the DocuSign
        signature platform first checks requests to ensure that the
        filter set supplied does not result in a zero-size response
        before querying the database.

        For example, for a request with a `from_to_status` of
        `delivered` and a current `status` of `created,sent`,
        DocuSign will always return an empty list.
        This is because the request translates to: find the
        envelopes that were delivered between the `from_date` and
        `to_date` dates that have a current status of `created` or
        `sent`. Since an envelope that has been delivered can
        never have a status of `created` or `sent`, a zero-size
        response would be generated.
        In this case, DocuSign does not query the database
        and returns an empty list immediately.

        Getting envelope status using `transaction_ids` is useful
        for offline signing situations where it can be used
        determine if an envelope was created or not. It can be used
        for the cases where a network connection was lost, before
        the envelope status could be returned.


        The following table shows the valid current envelope
        statuses (`status` parameter) for the different status
        qualifiers (`from_to_status` parameter) in the request. If
        the status and status qualifiers in the API request do not
        contain any of the values shown in the Valid Current
        Statuses column, then an empty list is returned.

        Client applications should check that the statuses (`status`
        parameter) they are requesting make sense for a given
        `from_to_status` parameter value.

        | Status Qualifier<br>(`from_to_status`) | Effective Status Qualifier | Valid Current Statuses                                                      |
        | :------------------------------------- | :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | any (changed)                          | StatusChanged              | any, created, sent, delivered, signed, completed, declined, voided, deleted |
        | created                                | Created                    | any, created, sent, delivered, signed, completed, declined, voided, deleted |
        | sent                                   | Sent                       | any, sent, delivered, signed, completed, declined, voided, deleted          |

        ## Extraneous results

        In some cases, a request for a specific envelope status will
        include envelopes with additional statuses. For example, in
        a request with a `from_date` of 2017-01-01, a `to_date` of
        2017-01-07 and the status qualifier (`from_to_status`) set
        to `delivered`, the response set might contain envelopes
        that were created during that time period, but not delivered
        during the time period. As a workaround, check the envelope
        status values in the result set as needed.

            Although you can use any date format
            supported by the .NET system library's
            [`DateTime.Parse()`][msoft] function,
            DocuSign recommends
            using [ISO 8601][] format dates
            with an explicit time zone offset
            If you do not provide
            a time zone offset,
            the method uses the server's time zone.

            For example, the following dates and times refer to the same instant:

            * `2017-05-02T01:44Z`
            * `2017-05-01T21:44-04:00`

            Although you can use any date format
            supported by the .NET system library's
            [`DateTime.Parse()`][msoft] function,
            DocuSign recommends
            using [ISO 8601][] format dates
            with an explicit time zone offset
            If you do not provide
            a time zone offset,
            the method uses the server's time zone.

            For example, the following dates and times refer to the same instant:

            * `2017-05-02T01:44Z`
            * `2017-05-01T21:44-04:00`

        Creates and sends an envelope or creates a draft envelope.
        Envelopes are fundamental resources in the DocuSign platform.


        With this method you can:

        * Create and send an envelope
          with [documents][], [recipients][], and [tabs][].
        * [Create and send an envelope from a template](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/templates/).
        * [Create and send an envelope from
          a combination of documents and templates](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/templates/composite/).
        * Create a draft envelope.


        When you use this method
        to create and send an envelope
        in a single request,
        the following parameters in the request body (an [`envelopeDefinition`][envelopeDefinition] object) are required:

        | Parameter      | Description |
        | :--------      | :---------- |
        | `status`       | Set to `sent` to send the envelope to recipients.<br>Set to `created` (or don't set at all) to save the envelope as a draft. |
        | `emailSubject` | The subject of the email used to send the envelope. |
        | `documents`    | The [documents][] to be signed. |
        | `recipients`   | The email addresses of the envelope [recipients][]. |


        When you create an envelope by using a
        [composite template](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/templates/composite/),
        you should specify the envelope custom fields in the inline template.
        Any custom fields that you specify at the root level are ignored.

        If the envelope has a workflow definition
        and the `workflowStatus` is `paused`,
        the envelope will not be sent immediately,
        even if the envelope's `status` is `sent`.


        ### Related topics

        [Envelope][envelopes] and [template][templates]
        objects along with [documents][documents],
        [recipients][recipients], and [tabs][tabs]
        are the five object models at the core of the eSignature API.
        The [eSignature concepts guide](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/)
        describes how the five object models work together.

        The following how-to articles contain
        practical examples that show you how to

            For some documents, one or more signatures must be witnessed by an appointed [notary public](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notary_public).

            DocuSign supports eNotary services for many jurisdictions. This example demonstrates how to send an envelope to be signed by Susan Signer with her signature witnessed by Nancy Notary. You must know the name and email address of the signer and the notary public for a signature to be notarized.

            Note that the full legal name of the signer must be used. It will be checked against the signer's government-issued proof of identity by the notary public.

            Please see the [DocuSign eNotary resource page](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/ndse-user-guide-enotary-resources) for further information. It lists the jurisdictions participating in the DocuSign eNotary program and additional reference information.

            Note that eNotary services are not included with all account types and are **not** included by default with demo/developer sandbox accounts. To enable eNotary service for your sandbox account, contact your DocuSign technical support person or DocuSign customer service.

            The example includes event notification via the Connect service.

            DocuSign enables document signers to use
            electronic or
            digital signatures.

            DocuSign has tightly integrated standard digital signatures into the DocuSign Signature platform. This enables a single envelope to include:

            * electronic signatures,
            * AES digital signatures using certificates from DocuSign or from your organization,
            * QES digital signatures from government certified Trust Service Providers (TSPs).

            This example enables the signer to create an eIDAS compliant AES signature with embedded signing. InPerson signers can also use SBS digital signatures.

            [More information on creating SBS digital signature requests.](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/standards-based-signatures/)

            The `clientId` in the example tells DocuSign that the Signing Ceremony will be embedded.
            The example also includes an `eventNotification` object for receiving envelope status updates from DocuSign.

            ## Embedding the signing ceremony
            1. Send the `Envelopes: create` call as shown below in the Request/Response section.
            2. The response will include the `envelopeId`
            3. Use the [EnvelopeViews: createRecipient](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopeviews/createrecipient/) request to obtain the redirectURL as follows:

            `POST /v2.1/accounts/{accountId}/envelopes/{envelopeId}/views/recipient`

            ````
            {
                "clientUserId": "1000",
                "email": "Sam@spade.com",
                "userName": "Sam Spade",
                "returnUrl": "https://your_app.example.com",
                "AuthenticationMethod": "Password"
            }
            ````
            The response will include the `url`. Redirect the user's browser to the URL to start the signing ceremony.

            **Note:** You must **immediately** redirect the user to the URL you receive from DocuSign. The URL is only valid for 5 minutes. Don't request a recipient view URL until you are ready to redirect the user's browser.

        | `transaction_ids` | A comma-separated list of transaction IDs<br>or the special value `request_body` |

        When you use the special value `request_body`, the request body looks like this:

        ```
        {

          ]
        }
        ```

        **Note:** Omitting the request body altogether causes the endpoint to return an error.
        The request body must be at least `{}`.

        This method enables you to make changes to an envelope.
        You can use it to:

        * [Send a draft envelope](#sending-a-draft-envelope)
        * [Void an in-process envelope](#voiding-an-in-process-envelope)
        * [Modify a draft envelope](#modifying-envelope-email-information)
        * [Purge documents and envelope metadata from the DocuSign platform](#purging-documents-from-docusign)

        Although the request body for this method
        is a complete envelope definition,
        you only need to provide
        the properties that
        you're updating.

        ## Sending a draft envelope

        To send a draft envelope, include the following code in the request body:

        ```json
        {
          "status": "sent"
        }
        ```

        You can attach a workflow before sending the envelope:

        ```json
        {
          "status": "sent",
          "workflow": {
            "workflowSteps": [
              {
                "action": "pause_before",
                "description": "pause_before routing order 2",
                "itemId": 2,
                "triggerOnItem": "routing_order"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```

        ## Working with workflows

        To unpause a workflow, the request body should include this:

        ```json
        {
          "workflow": {
            "workflowStatus": "in_progress"
          }
        }
        ```

        ## Voiding an in-process envelope

        To void an in-process envelope, include the following code in the request body:

        ```json
        {
          "status": "voided",
          "voidedReason": "The reason for voiding the envelope"
        }
        ```

        ## Modifying envelope email information

        To change the email subject and message of a draft envelope,
        include the following code in the request body:

        ```json
        {
          "emailSubject": "new email subject",
          "emailBlurb": "new email message"
        }
        ```

        ## Purging documents from docusign

        To place only the documents
        in the purge queue,
        leaving any
        corresponding attachments
        and tabs in the DocuSign platform,
        set the `purgeState` property
        to `documents_queued`.

        ```json
        {
          "envelopeId": "222e6847-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-72a3c9c16fca",
          "purgeState": "documents_queued"
        }
        ```

        To place documents,
        attachments,
        and tabs
        in the purge queue,
        set the `purgeState` property
        to `documents_and_metadata_queued`.

        ```json
        {
          "envelopeId": "222e6847-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-72a3c9c16fca",
          "purgeState": "documents_and_metadata_queued"
        }
        ```

        To place documents,
        attachments,
        and tabs
        in the purge queue
        and to redact personal information,
        set the `purgeState` property
        to `documents_and_metadata_and_redact_queued`.

        ```json
        {
          "envelopeId": "222e6847-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-72a3c9c16fca",
          "purgeState": "documents_and_metadata_and_redact_queued"
        }
        ```

        You can purge documents
        only from completed envelopes
        that are not marked as the authoritative copy.
        The user requesting the purge
        must have permission to purge documents
        and
        must be the sender or be acting on behalf of the sender.

        When the purge request is initiated
        the items to be purged
        are placed in the purge queue
        for deletion in 14 days.
        The sender
        and
        all recipients with DocuSign accounts
        associated with the envelope
        get an email notification
        the documents will be deleted in 14 days.
        The notification contains a link
        to the documents.
        A second email notification
        is sent 7 days later.
        At the end of the 14-day period
        the documents are deleted from the system.
        Recipients without DocuSign accounts
        do not receive email notifications.

        If your account has a Document Retention policy,
        envelope documents
        are automatically placed
        in the purge queue,
        and notification emails are sent
        at the end of the retention period.
        Setting a Document Retention policy is the same as setting a
        schedule for purging documents.

        ## Removing documents from the purge queue

        To remove documents from the purge queue, include the following code in the request body:

        ```json
        {
          "envelopeId": "222e6847-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-72a3c9c16fca",
          "purgeState": "documents_dequeued"
        }
        ```

        Envelope attachments are files that an application can include in an envelope. They are not converted to PDF. Envelope attachments are available only through the API. There is no user interface in the DocuSign web application for them.

        For a list of supported file formats, see [Supported File Formats](https://support.docusign.com/guides/ndse-user-guide-supported-file-formats).

        Retrieves the custom field information for the specified envelope. You can use these fields in the envelopes for your account to record information about the envelope, help search for envelopes, and track information. The envelope custom fields are shown in the Envelope Settings section when a user is creating an envelope in the DocuSign member console. The envelope custom fields are not seen by the envelope recipients.

        There are two types of envelope custom fields, text, and list. A text custom field lets the sender enter the value for the field. With a list custom field, the sender selects the value of the field from a pre-made list.

        Retrieves a single document or all documents from an envelope.

        To retrieve a single document, provide the ID of the document in the `documentId` path parameter.
        Alternatively, by setting the `documentId` parameter to special keyword values,
        you can retrieve all the documents (as a combined PDF, portfolio PDF, or ZIP archive)
        or just the certificate of completion. See the `documentId` description for how to retrieve each format.


        The response body of this method
        is a file. If you request multiple documents,
        the result is a ZIP archive
        that contains all of the documents.

        In all other cases, the response is a PDF
        file or PDF portfolio.


        You can get the file name and document ID from the response's `Content-Disposition` header:

        ```
        Content-Disposition: file; filename="NDA.pdf"; documentid="1
        ```

        By default, the response is the PDF file
        as a byte stream.
        For example a request/response in `curl` looks like this:

        ```
        $ curl --request GET 'https://demo.docusign.net/restapi/v2/accounts/0cdb3ff3-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-e43af011006d/envelopes/ea4cc25b-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-a67a0a2a4f6c/documents/1/' \
               --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ...bqg'


        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Length: 167539
        Content-Type: application/pdf
        . . .
        Content-Disposition: file; filename="Lorem_Ipsum.pdf"; documentid="1"
        Date: Tue, 23 Aug 2022 01:13:15 GMT

        %PDF-1.4
        %˚¸˝˛
        6 0 obj
        <</Length 14>>stream
        . . .
        ```

        By using the `Content-Transfer-Encoding`
        header in the request, you can obtain the PDF file
        encoded in base64. The same `curl` request with
        the base64 header would look like this:

        Adds or replaces a document in an existing draft or in-process envelope.
        An in-process envelope is one that has been sent but not yet completed or voided.


        **Note:** When adding or modifying documents for an in-process envelope,
        DocuSign recommends
        [locking the envelope](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopelocks/create/)
        prior to making any changes.

        To add a new document, set the `documentId` path parameter to a new document ID.

        To replace a document, set the `documentId` path parameter to the document ID of the existing document.
        The tabs of the original document will be applied to the new document.
        For example, a request in cURL looks like this:

        ```
        $ curl --location --request PUT 'https://demo.docusign.net/restapi/v2.1/accounts/0cdb3ff3-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-e43af011006d/envelopes/ea4cc25b-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-a67a0a2a4f6c/documents/1' \

        This method locks the specified envelope and sets the time until
        the lock expires to prevent other users or recipients from
        changing the envelope.

        The response to this request includes a `lockToken` parameter
        that you must use in the `X-DocuSign-Edit` header for
        every PUT method (typically a method that updates an envelope)
        while the envelope is locked.


        If you do not provide the `lockToken` when accessing
        a locked envelope, you will get the following
        error:

        ```
        {
           "errorCode": "EDIT_LOCK_NOT_LOCK_OWNER",
           "message": "The user is not the owner of the lock. The template is locked by another user or in another application"
        }
        ```


        ### The X-DocuSign-Edit header

        The `X-DocuSign-Edit` header looks like this
        and can be specified in either JSON or XML.

        **JSON**
        ```
        {
          "LockToken": "token-from-response",
          "LockDurationInSeconds": "600"
        }
        ```

        **XML**
        ```
        <DocuSignEdit>
          <LockToken>token-from-response</LockToken>
          <LockDurationInSeconds>600</LockDurationInSeconds>
        </DocuSignEdit>
        ```

        In the actual HTTP header, you would remove the linebreaks:

        ```
        X-DocuSign-Edit: {"LockToken": "token-from-response", "LockDurationInSeconds": "600" }
            or
        X-DocuSign-Edit:<DocuSignEdit><LockToken>token-from-response</LockToken><LockDurationInSeconds>600</LockDurationInSeconds></DocuSignEdit>
        ```

        Adds one or more recipients to an envelope.

        For an in-process envelope,
        one that has been sent and has not been completed or voided,
        an email is sent to a new recipient
        when they are reached in the routing order.
        If the new recipient's routing order
        is before or the same as the envelope's
        next recipient,
        an email is only sent if the optional
        `resend_envelope` query string is set to **true.**


        **Note:** This method works on recipients only.
        To add recipient tabs,
        use methods from the [EnvelopeRecipientTabs][recipientTabs] resource.
        For example, this request body will add a recipient (`astanton@example.com`)
        but **NOT** the Sign Here recipient tab.

        ```json
        {
          "signers": [
            {
              "email": "astanton@example.com",
              "name": "Anne Stanton",
              "recipientId": "1",
              "tabs": {           // These tabs will NOT be added
                "signHereTabs": [ // with this method. See note above.
                  {
                    "anchorString": "below",
                    "tooltip": "please sign here"
                  },
                  . . .
                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        Updates the recipients of a draft envelope or corrects recipient information for an in-process envelope.

        If you send information for a recipient that does not already
        exist in a draft envelope, the recipient is added to the envelope
        (similar to the [EnvelopeRecipients: Create][EnvelopeRecipients-create] method).

        You can also use this method to resend an envelope to a recipient
        by using the `resend_envelope` option.

        **Updating Sent Envelopes**

        After an envelope has been sent, you can edit only the following properties:

        - `accessCode`
        - `agentCanEditName`
        - `agentCanEditEmail`
        - `customFields`
        - `deliveryMethod`
        - `documentVisibility`
        - `email` (If you provide an email address in this method, it will be treated as a new email address, even if it is exactly the same as the current address. Do not provide an email address if you do not want a correction email sent.)
        - `emailNotification`
        - `idCheckConfigurationName`
        - `identityVerification`
        - `name`
        - `note`
        - `phoneAuthentication`
        - `recipientType` (For this to work, you must also change the recipient object to match the recipient type.)
        - `requireIdLookup`
        - `routingOrder`
        - `routingOrder`
        - `signingGroupId` (You can change this ID to switch to a different signing group and its corresponding set of recipients.)
        - `smsAuthentication`
        - `suppressEmails`
        - `userName`

        If the recipient has signed,
        but the envelope is still active,
        the method will return success,
        but the `recipientUpdateResults` property
        in the response will include an error
        that the recipient could not be updated:

        ```
        {
          "recipientUpdateResults": [
            {
              "recipientId": "999",
              "errorDetails": {
                "errorCode": "RECIPIENT_UPDATE_FAILED",
                "message": "The recipient could not be updated.  Recipient not in state that allows correction."
              }
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        If the envelope is completed,
        and you try to change a recipient's address,
        the method will fail with this error:

        ```
        {
          "errorCode": "ENVELOPE_INVALID_STATUS",
          "message": "Invalid envelope status. Envelope status is not one of: Created, Sent, Delivered, Correct."
        }
        ```

        **Note:** This method works on recipients only.
        To add recipient tabs,
        use methods from the [EnvelopeRecipientTabs][recipientTabs] resource.
        For example, this request body will add a recipient (`astanton@example.com`)
        but **NOT** the Sign Here recipient tab.

        ```json
        {
          "signers": [
            {
              "email": "astanton@example.com",
              "name": "Anne Stanton",
              "recipientId": "1",
        // THIS WILL NOT WORK
              "tabs": {
                "signHereTabs": [
                  {
                    "anchorString": "below",
                    "tooltip": "please sign here3"
                  },
                  . . .
                ]
              }
            }
          ]

        Retrieves the initials image for the specified user. The image is returned in the same format as it was uploaded. In the request you can specify if the chrome (the added line and identifier around the initial image) is returned with the image.

        The userId specified in the endpoint must match the authenticated user's user ID and the user must be a member of the account.

        The `signatureIdOrName` parameter accepts signature ID or signature name. DocuSign recommends you use signature ID (`signatureId`), since some names contain characters that do not properly URL encode. If you use the user name, it is likely that the name includes spaces and you might need to URL encode the name before using it in the endpoint.

        For example: "Bob Smith" to "Bob%20Smith"

        Older envelopes might only contain chromed images. If getting the non-chromed image fails, try getting the chromed image.

        The userId specified in the endpoint must match the authenticated user's user ID and the user must be a member of the account.

        The `signatureIdOrName` parameter accepts signature ID or signature name. DocuSign recommends you use signature ID (`signatureId`), since some names contain characters that don't properly URL encode. If you use the user name, it is likely that the name includes spaces and you might need to URL encode the name before using it in the endpoint. 

        For example: "Bob Smith" to "Bob%20Smith"

        Older envelopes might only have chromed images. If getting the non-chromed image fails, try getting the chromed image.

        Returns a URL that allows you to embed the envelope correction view of the DocuSign UI. To customize the appearance of the correction view, you can add special query parameters to the returned URL when you use it in your application.

        You can revoke this URL by calling the [deleteEnvelopeCorrectView](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopeviews/deleteenvelopecorrectview/) endpoint.

        ## Best practices

        The returned URL expires after 10 minutes and can only be used once. Therefore, request the URL immediately before you redirect your user to it.

        Due to screen space issues, do not use an `<iframe>` for embedded operations on mobile devices. For iOS devices, DocuSign recommends using a WebView.

        ## Customizing the correction view

        To customize the appearance of the correction view, you can add query parameters **to the URL that is returned by this endpoint and used in your application.** Do not add these query parameters to the URL of the endpoint itself.

        For example, adding the following query parameters to the URL returned by this method causes the sending view to:

        - start in the tagging screen
        - hide the Edit Pages command
        - hide all of the options under the Actions dropdown except Save, Close, and Discard

        ```
        https://demo.docusign.net/Member/StartInSession.aspx?StartConsole=1&t=dd3b7c4c-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-50cd195a3401&DocuEnvelope=f37489d3-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-4de057063d0e&\
                advcorrect=1&\
                showEditPages=false&\
                showHeaderActions=false
        ```


        The default value reflects what happens
        if you omit the customization query parameter.
        You can use the interactive
        [Embedded Sending Demo tool](https://dsdemos.esigndemos.com/embeddedsending/v3/embeddedsending.aspx)
        to see the effect of using different query parameters.

        ##  Modifying the envelope after redirection

        If you use `sendButtonAction=redirect` or `backButtonAction=redirect`, and you intend to modify the envelope after redirection, you will need to lock the envelope and add an extra query parameter:

        1.  [Create a lock token][createLock] for the envelope.
        2.  Add the new lock token to the URL with the `lockToken` query parameter.<br>
            `...&sendButtonAction=redirect&lockToken=MDgxZxabUVBiMWUzZWYz`<br>
            **Note:** The `lockToken` query parameter is case-sensitive.


        After clicking Continue,
        your user is redirected back to your integration.
        You can then [delete the lock token][deleteLock].

        [createLock]: /docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopelocks/create/
        [deleteLock]: /docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopelocks/delete/


        ## Information security notice

        This method provides full access to the sending account. When you
        use this view, the current user has full access to the account.
        If the account has administrative privileges, then this method
        also provides administrator access.

        If your use case needs to enable a sender to update a draft
        envelope before it is sent or make other changes, take one of the
        following steps:

        - Configure each sender to have their own individual user account
          to use this API method.
        - Enhance your API integration so that this method is not needed.
          Your integration can create the tabs, recipients,
          and other envelope settings as needed.

        Returns a URL that enables you to embed the edit view of the DocuSign UI in your applications. This is a one-time use login token that allows the user to be placed into the DocuSign editing view.  Upon sending completion, the user is returned to the return URL provided by the API application.

        See [Embedded signing and sending](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/embedding/)
        to learn more about embedding.

        Due to screen space issues,
        do not use an `<iframe>` for embedded operations on mobile devices.
        For iOS devices, DocuSign recommends using a WebView.

        ### Revoking the URL

        You can revoke this URL by making
        a DELETE HTTP request to the URL
        with no request body.

        ## Information security notice

        This method provides full access to the sending account. When you
        use this view, the current user has full access to the account.
        If the account has administrative privileges, then this method
        also provides administrator access.

        If your use case needs to enable a sender to update a draft envelope before it is sent or make other changes, take one of the following steps:

        - Configure each sender to have their own individual user account to use this API method.</li>
        - Enhance your API integration so that this method is not needed. Your integration can create the tabs, recipients, and other envelope settings as needed.</li>

        Returns a URL that enables you to
        [embed the recipient view](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/embedding/)
        of the
        DocuSign UI in your applications. If the recipient is a signer,
        then the view will provide the signing ceremony.

        This method is only used with envelopes in the `sent` status.

        Due to screen space issues,
        do not use an `<iframe>` for embedded operations on mobile devices.
        For iOS devices, DocuSign recommends using a WebView.

        ### Revoking the URL

        You can revoke this URL by making
        a DELETE HTTP request to the URL
        with no request body.


        ## Authentication

        Your application is responsible for authenticating the identity
        of the recipient or signer when you use this method. Use the
        following parameters to record how the recipient
        was authenticated.

        - `assertionId`
        - `authenticationInstant`
        - `authenticationMethod`
        - `clientUserId`
        - `securityDomain`

        At a minimum, `authenticationMethod` and `clientUserId` are
        required. The information that you provide is included in the
        envelope's certificate of completion.

        ## Redirects
        After the signer completes or ends the signing ceremony, DocuSign
        redirects the user's browser back to your app via the
        `returnUrl` that you supply.

        **Note:** The user may be redirected through various DocuSign
        subdomains, depending on the region of the account sending the
        envelope. Please consult the **Allowlists for DocuSign eSignature service**
        section in [Security for DocuSign eSignature](https://www.docusign.com/trust/security/esignature)
        when setting up your allowlists.

        ### The event status parameter
        DocuSign appends an `event` query parameter to the `returnUrl` with the
        outcome of the signing ceremony. Your app can use this event
        parameter to determine the next step for the envelope.
        Do not fetch the envelope status by using
        [Envelopes: get](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopes/get/)
        or a similar method because doing so could break
        the DocuSign rule against polling.

        **Note:** Because a user can cancel redirection, close their
        browser after signing, or spoof the landing URL, the
        `returnUrl` should not be the single source of truth for envelope
        status for your integration.

        ## The URL is time-limited

        The URL returned in this method's response is valid for one use,
        and you must use or display it within a couple of minutes after
        it is generated. After the recipient is redirected to the
        recipient view, they must interact with the DocuSign system
        periodically or their session will time out.

        Because the URL is time-limited, it should not be stored or sent
        through email. After you receive it, immediately redirect the
        user's browser to the URL.

        If you want to invite someone to an embedded signing session via
        email, the email invitation's URL must be to your application.
        When invoked, your app should request a `recipientView` URL from
        DocuSign and then redirect the signer to that URL.

        ## Maintaining State
        After the recipient completes the recipient view (or signing
        ceremony), they are redirected to your application. Your
        application can recover state information about the transaction
        by storing information in a cookie, or by including query
        parameters in the `returnUrl` field. For example.
        `https://myapp.example.com/docusign_return?myState=12345` When the
        user is redirected to your app, the `event` query parameter will
        be appended. In this example, prevent spoofing by not using a
        guessable value as the state value.


        ## How to specify the default language

        The language for the recipient view
        follows this order or precedence:

        - The language specified by the sender for the recipient.
        - The `locale` parameter appended to the URL.
        - The account language if the signer has a DocuSign account.
        - The language used in a previous signing if the signer is return signer.
        - The browser language.

        You can append the `locale`
        query parameter
        to the URL returned by this method
        to specify a language.
        For example, to set the default language
        to Canadian French, you would set
        it like this:

        ```
        ...?locale=fr_CA
        ```

        ## Sending to a remote signer

        You can request a signing session for a remote recipient
        who has a DocuSign account.

        Authenticate the request using the recipient's
        credentials, and do not specify a  `clientUserId`.
        This differs from the typical behavior where the
        request is authenticated using the sender's credentials,
        and the recipient has a `clientUserId` defined.

        Returns a URL that enables you to embed the sender view
        of the DocuSign UI in your applications.

        See [Embedded signing and sending](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/embedding/)
        to learn more about embedding.

        The returned URL can only be redirected to immediately after it
        is generated. It can only be used once. Therefore, request the
        URL immediately before you redirect your user to it.

        Due to screen space issues,
        do not use an `<iframe>` for embedded operations on mobile devices.
        For iOS devices, DocuSign recommends using a WebView.

        After the user has completed the sending view, the browser is
        redirected to the `returnUrl` supplied.

        By default, if the envelope already contains one or more
        documents, DocuSign will initially show the document tagging view
        when you redirect to the URL.

        To start with the envelope's recipients and documents view
        instead, examine the URL in the method's response. Then change
        the query parameter from `send=1` to `send=0` to start with the
        recipients/documents view.

        ### Revoking the URL

        You can revoke this URL by making
        a DELETE HTTP request to the URL
        with no request body.



        ## Customizing the sending view

        You can add query parameters
        to customize the appearance of the sending view.
        For example, adding the following query parameters
        to the URL returned by this method
        causes the sending view to:

        - start in the tagging screen
        - hide the Edit Pages command
        - hide all of the options under the Actions dropdown except Save, Close, and Discard

        ```
        https://demo.docusign.net/Member/StartInSession.aspx?StartConsole=1&t=dd3b7c4c-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-50cd195a3401&DocuEnvelope=f37489d3-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-4de057063d0e&\
                send=1&\
                showEditPages=false&\
                showHeaderActions=false
        ```


        The default value reflects what happens
        if you omit the customization query parameter.
        You can use the interactive
        [Embedded Sending Demo tool](https://dsdemos.esigndemos.com/embeddedsending/v3/embeddedsending.aspx)
        to see the effect of using different query parameters.

        | Query Parameter             | Default Value                                                                                                    | Alternate Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

        ##  Modifying the envelope after redirection

        If you use `sendButtonAction=redirect`
        or
        `backButtonAction=redirect`,
        and
        you intend to modify the envelope after redirection,
        you will need to lock the envelope
        and
        add an extra query parameter:

        1.  [Create a lock token][createLock] for the envelope.
        2.  Add the new lock token to the URL with the `lockToken` query parameter.<br>
            `...&sendButtonAction=redirect&lockToken=MDgxZxabUVBiMWUzZWYz`<br>
            **Note:** The `lockToken` query parameter is case-sensitive.


        After clicking Continue,
        your user is redirected back to your integration.
        You can then [delete the lock token][deleteLock].

        [createLock]: /docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopelocks/create/
        [deleteLock]: /docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopelocks/delete/


        ## Information security notice

        This method provides full access to the sending account. When you
        use this view, the current user has full access to the account.
        If the account has administrative privileges, then this method
        also provides administrator access.

        If your use case needs to enable a sender to update a draft
        envelope before it is sent or make other changes, take one of the
        following steps:

        - Configure each sender to have their own individual user account
          to use this API method.
        - Enhance your API integration so that this method is not needed.
          Your integration can create the tabs, recipients,
          and other envelope settings as needed.

        Returns a URL that enables you to embed the DocuSign UI recipient view of a [shared envelope](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/ndse-admin-guide-share-envelopes) in your applications. This is the view that a user sees of an envelope that a recipient on the same account has shared with them.

        Due to screen space issues,
        do not use an `<iframe>` for embedded operations on mobile devices.
        For iOS devices, DocuSign recommends using a WebView.

        ### Revoking the URL

        You can revoke this URL by making
        a DELETE HTTP request to the URL
        with no request body.

As a workaround, you can update the delay or send time to one minute in the future using the [updateEnvelopeDelayedRoutingDefinition](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopeworkflowdefinition/updateEnvelopeDelayedRoutingDefinition/) endpoint. 

        **Note:** After deleting the delayed routing object, the workflow step still contains the `pause_before` action. Once the workflow step is reached, you will need to [unpause the envelope](/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/unpause-workflow/). If you want to delete the step entirely, use [deleteEnvelopeWorkflowStepDefinition](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopeworkflowdefinition/deleteenvelopeworkflowstepdefinition/) instead.

        Moves an envelope from its current folder to the specified folder.

        You can use this method to delete envelopes by specifying `recyclebin` in the `folderId` parameter.
        Placing an in-process envelope (envelope status of `sent` or `delivered`) in the recycle bin voids the envelope.

        You can also use this method

        by specifying a template ID

        Creates one or more groups for the account.

        Groups can be used to help manage users by associating users with a group. You can associate a group with a Permission Profile, which sets the user permissions for users in that group without having to set the `userSettings` property for each user. You are not required to set Permission Profiles for a group, but it makes it easier to manage user permissions for a large number of users. You can also use groups with template sharing to limit user access to templates.

        This method deletes a permission profile from an account.

        To delete a permission profile, it must not have any users associated with it. When you use this method to delete a permission profile, you can reassign the users associated with it to a new permission profile at the same time by using the `move_users_to` query parameter.

        This method creates a new PowerForm.

        You create a PowerForm from an existing DocuSign [template](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/templates/templates/create/), based on the `templateId` in the request body.

         PowerForms that you create from a template are referred to as *web PowerForms*.

        **Note:** The DocuSign Admin console also supports creating a PowerForm by uploading a PDF file that has active form fields (referred to as a *PDF PowerForm*). However, PDF PowerForms are deprecated and are not supported in the API.

        **Note:** A PowerForm can have only one sender. (Because PowerForms are not necessarily sent by email, this user is also referred to as the PowerForm *initiator*.) If you need to associate multiple senders with a PowerForm, create multiple copies of the PowerForm by using the same template (one copy for each sender). By default, the sender is the PowerForm Administrator who creates the PowerForm.


        ### Signing modes

        You can use one of the following signing modes for a PowerForm:

        **`email`**

        This mode verifies the recipient's identity by using email authentication before the recipient can sign a document. The recipient enters their email address on the landing page and then clicks **Begin Signing** to begin the signing process. The system then sends an email message with a validation code to the recipient. If the recipient does not provide a valid email address, they do not receive the email message containing the access code and are not able to open and sign the document.

        Alternatively, you can make the process easier for signers by using email authentication only and omitting the access code. To do this, you append the `activateonly` flag to the PowerForm URL and set it to true by passing in the value `1`.  When the flag is active, the first recipient receives an email with a link that initiates the signing session without having to enter access code.

        Example: `activateonly=1`

        **`direct`**

        This mode does not require any verification. After a recipient enters their email address on the landing page and clicks **Begin Signing,** a new browser tab opens and the recipient can immediately begin the signing process.

        Because the `direct` signing mode does not verify the recipient's identity by using email authentication, we strongly recommend that you use this mode only when the PowerForm is accessible behind a secure portal where the recipient's identity is already authenticated, or where another form of authentication is specified for the recipient in the DocuSign template (for example, an access code, phone authentication, or ID check).

        **Note:** In the account settings, `enablePowerFormDirect` must be **true** to use `direct` as the `signingMode`.

        ### Redirect URLs

        You can control the URL to which signers are redirected after signing your PowerForm. However, the URL is specified elsewhere, outside of the PowerForm creation process. For details, see [How do I specify a URL to redirect to when a PowerForm is completed?](https://support.docusign.com/en/articles/How-do-I-specify-a-URL-to-redirect-to-when-a-Powerform-is-completed).

        This sets the shared access status for one or more users or templates.

        When setting user shared access, only users with account administration privileges can set shared access status for envelopes.

        When setting template shared access, only users who own a template and have sharing permission or with account administration privileges can set shared access for templates.

        Changes to the shared items status are not additive. The change always replaces the current status.

        To change template shared access, add the query parameter `item_type` = `templates` to the request. When this is set, the user and envelopes properties are not required.

        **Note:** This functionality is a newer version of the [Update Group Share](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/templates/templates/updategroupshare/) functionality.

        Creates one or more template definitions, using a multipart
        request for each template.

        [Templates](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/templates/)
        help streamline the sending process when you frequently
        send the same or similar documents, or send different documents
        to the same group of people.

        When you create a template, you define placeholder roles. Rather
        than specifying a person, you specify a role that regularly
        participates in a transaction that uses the template. Then, when
        you create or send an envelope based on the template, you assign
        actual recipients to the template roles. The recipients
        automatically inherit all of the workflow that is defined for
        that role in the template, such as the tabs and routing
        information.

        ## Template Email Subject Merge Fields

        Placeholder roles have associated merge fields that personalize
        the email notification that DocuSign sends. For example, the
        template automatically personalizes the email message by adding
        placeholders for the recipient's name and email address within
        the email subject line, based on the recipient's role. When the
        sender adds the name and email information for the recipient and
        sends the envelope, the recipient information is automatically
        merged into the appropriate fields in the email subject line.

        Both the sender and the recipients will see the information in
        the email subject line for any emails associated with the
        template. This provides an easy way for senders to organize their
        envelope emails without having to open an envelope to find out
        who the recipient is.



        Use the following placeholders
        to insert a recipient's name or
        email address in the subject line

        To insert a recipient's name into the subject line,
        use the `[[<roleName>_UserName]]` placholder
        in the  `emailSubject` property when you create the
        template:

        To include a recipient's name
        or email address in the subject line,
        use the following placeholders
        in the `emailSubject` property:

        - `[[<roleName>_UserName]]`
        - `[[<roleName>_Email]]`


        For example, if the role name is `Signer 1`,
        you might set `emailSubject` to one of these strings:

        - `"[[Signer 1_UserName]], Please sign this NDA"`
        - `"[[Signer 1_Email]], Please sign this NDA"`


        **Note:** The maximum length of the
        subject line is 100 characters,
        including any merged text.


        ## Creating multiple templates

        To create multiple templates, you provide a zip file of JSON
        files. You can also use the Templates::ListTemplates method with
        the `is_download` query parameter to download a zip file
        containing your existing templates and use that as a guide. The
        API supports both .zip and .gzip file formats as input.

        You also need to set the
        `Content-Length`,
        `Content-Type`,
        and
        `Content-Disposition`
        headers:


        ```
        Content-Length: 71068
        Content-Type: application/zip
        Content-Disposition: file; filename="DocuSignTemplates_Nov_25_2019_20_40_21.zip"; fileExtension=.zip
        ```

            Unlike other IDs in the eSignature API,
            you specify the `documentId` yourself.
            Typically the first document has the ID
            `1`, the second document `2`, and so on,

            (1 through 2147483647).


            Tab objects have a `documentId` property
            that specifies the document on which to place
            the tab.

            The unique ID of the document within the envelope.

            Unlike other IDs in the eSignature API,
            you specify the `documentId` yourself.
            Typically the first document has the ID
            `1`, the second document `2`, and so on,
            but you can use any numbering scheme
            that fits within a 32-bit signed integer
            (1 through 2147483647).


            Tab objects have a `documentId` property
            that specifies the document on which to place
            the tab.

        This method takes an optional query parameter

        are kept or discarded.

        You can use this method to recover the lock information,
        including the `lockToken`,
        for a locked template.
        The `X-DocuSign-Edit` header is included in the response.

      description: |+
        This method locks the specified template and sets the time until
        the lock expires to prevent other users or recipients from
        changing the template.

        The response to this request includes a `lockToken` parameter
        that you must use in the `X-DocuSign-Edit` header for
        every PUT method (typically a method that updates a template)
        while the template is locked.


        If you do not provide the `lockToken` when accessing
        a locked template, you will get the following
        error:

        ```
        {
           "errorCode": "EDIT_LOCK_NOT_LOCK_OWNER",
           "message": "The user is not the owner of the lock. The template is locked by another user or in another application"
        }
        ```


        ### The X-DocuSign-Edit header

        The `X-DocuSign-Edit` header looks like this
        and can be specified in either JSON or XML.

        **JSON**
        ```
        {
          "LockToken": "token-from-response",
          "LockDurationInSeconds": "600"
        }
        ```

        **XML**
        ```
        <DocuSignEdit>
          <LockToken>token-from-response</LockToken>
          <LockDurationInSeconds>600</LockDurationInSeconds>
        </DocuSignEdit>
        ```

        In the actual HTTP header, you would remove the linebreaks:

        ```
        X-DocuSign-Edit: {"LockToken": "token-from-response", "LockDurationInSeconds": "600" }
            or
        X-DocuSign-Edit:<DocuSignEdit><LockToken>token-from-response</LockToken><LockDurationInSeconds>600</LockDurationInSeconds></DocuSignEdit>
        ```

        Adds new users to an account. 

        The body of this request is an array of `newUsers` objects. For each new user, you must provide at least the `userName` and `email` properties. The maximum number of users you can create in one request is 500 users. 

        The `userSettings` property specifies the actions users can perform. In the example below, Tal Mason will be able to send envelopes, and the activation email will be in French because the `locale` is set to `fr`.


        ```
        POST /restapi/v2.1/accounts/{accountId}/users
        Content-Type: application/json
        ```
        ```
        {
          "newUsers": [
            {
              "userName": "Claire Horace",
              "email": "claire@example.com"
            },
            {
              "userName": "Tal Mason",
              "email": "talmason@example.com",
              "company": "TeleSel",
              "userSettings": {
                "locale": "fr",
                "canSendEnvelope": true
              }
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        A successful response is a `newUsers` array with information about the newly created users. If there was a problem in creating a user, that user entry will contain an `errorDetails` property that describes what went wrong.

        Custom settings provide a flexible way to store and retrieve
        custom user information that you can use in your own system.

        **Important:** There is a limit on the size for all the custom
        user settings for a single user. The limit is 4,000 characters,
        which includes the XML and JSON structure for the settings.

        You can group custom user settings when adding them. Grouping
        allows you to retrieve settings that are in a specific group,
        instead of retrieving all the user custom settings.

        To group custom user settings, include the
        `X-DocuSign-User-Settings-Key` header in the request:

        `X-DocuSign-User-Settings-Key:group_name`

        Where the `group_name` is your designated name for the group of
        customer user settings.

        When getting or deleting grouped custom user settings, you must
        include the `X-DocuSign-User-Settings-Key` header information.

        Grouping custom user settings is not required and if the `X-DocuSign-User-Settings-Key`
        header information is not included, the custom user settings are
        added normally and can be retrieved or deleted without including
        the `X-DocuSign-User-Settings-Key` header.

When changing a user's name, you can either change the information in the `userName` property OR change the information in `firstName`, `middleName`, `lastName, suffixName`, and `title` properties. Changes to `firstName`, `middleName`, `lastName`, `suffixName`, and `title` properties take precedence over changes to the `userName` property.

        This method retrieves the signature definitions for the user that you specify.

        The `userId` parameter specified in the endpoint must match the authenticated user's user ID, and the user must be a member of the account.

        The `signatureId` parameter accepts a signature ID or a signature name. DocuSign recommends you use signature ID (`signatureId`), since some names contain characters that do not properly encode into a URL. If you use the user name, it is likely that the name includes spaces. In that case, URL encode the name before using it in the endpoint. 

        For example, encode "Bob Smith" as "Bob%20Smith".

        Adds a user signature image and/or user initials image to the specified user. 

        The userId property specified in the endpoint must match the authenticated user's `userId` and the user must be a member of the account.

        The rules and processes associated with this are:

        * If `Content-Type` is set to `application/json`, then the default behavior for creating a default signature image, based on the name and a DocuSign font, is used.
        * If `Content-Type` is set to `multipart/form-data`, then the request must contain a first part with the user signature information, followed by parts that contain the images.

        For each Image part, the Content-Disposition header has a "filename" value that is used to map to the `signatureName` and/or `signatureInitials` properties in the JSON to the image. 

        For example: 
        `Content-Disposition: file; filename="Ron Test20121127083900"`

        If no matching image (by filename value) is found, then the image is not set. One, both, or neither of the signature and initials images can be set with this call.

        The Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64 header, set in the header for the part containing the image, can be set to indicate that the images are formatted as base64 instead of as binary.

        If successful, 200-OK is returned, and a JSON structure containing the signature information is provided, note that the signatureId can change with each API POST, PUT, or DELETE since the changes to the signature structure cause the current signature to be closed, and a new signature record to be created.

        Updates the jurisdiction information about a notary.

        The following restrictions apply:

        - The current user must be a notary.
        - The `jurisdictionId` path parameter must be a jurisdiction that the notary is registered for.
        - The `jurisdictionId` path parameter must match the request body's `jurisdiction.jurisdictionId`.

        The request body must have a full `jurisdiction` object for the jurisdiction property.
        The best way to do this is to use `getNotaryJurisdiction` to obtain the current values and update the properties you want to change.

        For example, assume `getNotaryJurisdiction` returns this:

        ```
        {
            "jurisdiction": {
                "jurisdictionId": "15",
                "name": "Iowa",
                "county": "",
                "enabled": "true",
                "countyInSeal": "false",
                "commissionIdInSeal": "true",
                "stateNameInSeal": "true",
                "notaryPublicInSeal": "true",
                "allowSystemCreatedSeal": "true",
                "allowUserUploadedSeal": "false"
            },
            "commissionId": "123456",
            "commissionExpiration": "2020-08-31T07:00:00.0000000Z",
            "registeredName": "Bob Notary",
            "county": "Adams",
            "sealType": "system_created"
        }
        ```

        If you want to change the name of the notary from "Bob Notary" to "Robert Notary", your request body would be:

        ```
        {
            "jurisdiction": {
                "jurisdictionId": "15",
                "name": "Iowa",
                "county": "",
                "enabled": "true",
                "countyInSeal": "false",
                "commissionIdInSeal": "true",
                "stateNameInSeal": "true",
                "notaryPublicInSeal": "true",

                "allowUserUploadedSeal": "false"

            "county": "Adams",

        Enables or disables API request logging for troubleshooting.

        When enabled (`apiRequestLogging` is **true**),
        REST API requests and responses for the user are added to a log.
        A log can have up to 50 requests/responses
        and the current number of log entries can be determined
        by getting the settings.
        Logging is automatically disabled when the log limit of 50 is reached.

        You can call
        [Diagnostics: getRequestLog](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/diagnostics/requestlogs/get/)
        or
        [Diagnostics: listRequestLogs](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/diagnostics/requestlogs/list/)
        to download the log files (individually or as a zip file).
        Call [Diagnostics: deleteRequestLogs](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/diagnostics/requestlogs/delete/)
        to clear the log by deleting current entries.

        Private information, such as passwords and integration key information,
        which is normally located in the call header is omitted from the request/response log.

        API request logging only captures requests from the authenticated user.
        Any call that does not authenticate the user and resolve a userId is not logged.

               - When the envelope has been sent to recipients.
               - When using remote signing, this event is triggered when the email notification with a link to the documents is sent to at least one recipient.
               - When using embedded signing, this event is triggered when the link is ready for the recipient to sign the envelope.

               An envelope remains in this state until all recipients have viewed or taken action on the envelope.

            - `delivered`: This status is triggered when all recipients have opened the envelope, selected the **Continue** button in the interface, and viewed the documents.
            - `completed`: This status is triggered when all recipients have completed their assigned actions on an envelope.
            - `declined`: This status is triggered when a recipient has declined to sign the envelope.
            - `voided`: The voided status indicates that the sender has voided the envelope.

            - `declined`: The recipient has declined to sign a document in the envelope.
            - `authenticationfailed`: At least one signer has failed the authentication check on the document. If this occurs, you have two options:
               - Send a reminder to the recipients, which provides the signer with another chance to access and pass the authentication.
               - Correct the document and modify the authentication setting.
            - `autoresponded`: The recipient's email system sent back an automatic response. This status is only used when **Send-on-behalf-of** is turned off for the account.

        requiresAcknowledgement:
          description: |+
            When **true,** event delivery acknowledgements are enabled for your Connect configuration.

            DocuSign Connect awaits a valid 200 response from your application acknowledging that it received a message. If you do not acknowledge receiving an event notification message within 100 seconds, DocuSign treats the message as a failure and places it into a failure queue. It is imperative that you acknowledge successful receipt of Connect events as they occur by sending a 200 event back.

            #### When **true** and Send Individual Messages (SIM) mode is activated

            If the HTTP status response to a notification message is not in the range of 200-299,
            then the message delivery failed, and the configuration is marked as down.

            The message will be queued and retried once per day.
            While a Connect configuration is marked down, subsequent notifications will not be tried. Instead they will be immediately queued with the reason `Pending`.
            When a message succeeds, all queued messages for the configuration will be tried immediately, in order.

            There is a maximum of ten retries. Alternately, you can use **Republish Connect Information** to manually republish the notification.

            #### When **true** and SIM mode is not activated

            If the HTTP Status response to a notification message is not in the range of 200-299,  then the message delivery failed, and the message is queued.

            The message will be retried after at least a day the next time a subsequent message is successfully sent to this configuration (subscription).  Subsequent notifications will be tried when they occur.
            There is a maximum of ten retries. Alternately, you can use **Republish Connect Information** to manually republish the notification.

            #### When **false**

            When `requiresAcknowledgement` is set to **false** and you do not acknowledge receiving an event notification message within 100 seconds, DocuSign treats the message as a failure and determines that the server is unavailable. It does not retry to send the notification message, and you must handle the failure manually.

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

    EnvelopeDocumentVisibility:

        Document Visibility enables senders to control the visibility of the documents in an envelope at the recipient level. For example, if the parties associated with a legal proceeding should have access to different documents, the Document Visibility feature enables you to keep all of the documents in the same envelope and set view permissions for the documents by recipient. This functionality is enabled for envelopes and templates. It is not available for PowerForms.

        **Note:** Before you use Document Visibility, you should be aware of the following information:

        - Document Visibility must be enabled for your account by your DocuSign administrator. 
        - A document cannot be hidden from a recipient if the recipient has tabs assigned to them on the document. 
        - When the Document Visibility setting hides a document from a recipient, the document also does not appear in the recipient's list of envelopes, documents, or page images.
        - Carbon Copy, Certified Delivery (Needs to Sign), Editor, and Agent recipients can always see all of the documents associated with the envelope or template.

        The Document Visibility feature has multiple settings that specify the options that senders have when sending documents. For more information, see [Use Document Visibility to Control Recipient Access](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/ndse-user-guide-document-visibility).

            - `direct`: This mode does not require any verification. DocuSign recommends that you use this signing method only when another form of authentication is in use.

            **Note:** In the account settings, `enablePowerFormDirect` must be **true** to use `direct` as the `signingMode`.

            This setting takes one of the following options: 

            - `initial_access`: The authentication check always applies the first time a recipient accesses the documents. Recipients are not asked to authenticate again when they access the documents from the same browser on the same device. If the recipient attempts to access the documents from a different browser or a different device, the recipient must pass authentication again. Once authenticated, that recipient is not challenged again on the new device or browser. The ability for a recipient to skip authentication for documents is limited to documents sent from the same sending account.
            - `each_access`: Authentication checks apply every time a recipient attempts to access the envelope. However, you can configure the Authentication Expiration setting to allow recipients to skip authentication when they have recently passed authentication by setting a variable time frame.

            **Note:** Only Admin users can change this setting.

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: |-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. 

            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.

            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.

            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. 

            *Example*: 

            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

            When enforce signer visibility is enabled, documents with tabs can only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document. Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent.

          description: |
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: |-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. 

            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.

            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.

            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets.

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: |-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. 

            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.

            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.

            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. 

            *Example*: 

            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

            When enforce signer visibility is enabled, documents with tabs can only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document. Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent.

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: |-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. 

            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.

            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.

            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. 

            *Example*: 

            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

            When enforce signer visibility is enabled, documents with tabs can only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document. Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

          description: |
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            When using any of [the legacy event message formats](/platform/webhooks/connect/legacy-message-formats/), you must include either the `envelopeEvents` property or the `recipientEvents` property. If you are instead using the [JSON SIM event model](/platform/webhooks/connect/improved-json-sim-event-model/), use the `events` property.

            The [possible event statuses](/platform/webhooks/connect/event-triggers/) are:

            * `Sent`
            * `AutoResponded`

        requiresAcknowledgement:
          description: |+
            When **true,** event delivery acknowledgements are enabled for your Connect configuration.

            DocuSign Connect awaits a valid 200 response from your application acknowledging that it received a message. If you do not acknowledge receiving an event notification message within 100 seconds, DocuSign treats the message as a failure and places it into a failure queue. It is imperative that you acknowledge successful receipt of Connect events as they occur by sending a 200 event back.

            #### When **true** and Send Individual Messages (SIM) mode is activated

            If the HTTP status response to a notification message is not in the range of 200-299,
            then the message delivery failed, and the configuration is marked as down.

            The message will be queued and retried once per day.
            While a Connect configuration is marked down, subsequent notifications will not be tried. Instead they will be immediately queued with the reason `Pending`.
            When a message succeeds, all queued messages for the configuration will be tried immediately, in order.

            There is a maximum of ten retries. Alternately, you can use **Republish Connect Information** to manually republish the notification.

            #### When **true** and SIM mode is not activated

            If the HTTP Status response to a notification message is not in the range of 200-299,  then the message delivery failed, and the message is queued.

            The message will be retried after at least a day the next time a subsequent message is successfully sent to this configuration (subscription).  Subsequent notifications will be tried when they occur.
            There is a maximum of ten retries. Alternately, you can use **Republish Connect Information** to manually republish the notification.

            #### When **false**

            When `requiresAcknowledgement` is set to **false** and you do not acknowledge receiving an event notification message within 100 seconds, DocuSign treats the message as a failure and determines that the server is unavailable. It does not retry to send the notification message, and you must handle the failure manually.

        A `connectSalesforceObject` is an object that updates envelope and document status or recipient status in your Salesforce account.

        When you install DocuSign Connect for Salesforce, the service automatically sets up two Connect objects: one that updates envelope status and documents and one that updates recipient status. You can also customize DocuSign Connect for Salesforce by associating DocuSign objects with Salesforce objects so that DocuSign Connect for Salesforce updates or inserts the information into the Salesforce object.

          description: |
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**
          type: string

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

        anchorAllowWhiteSpaceInCharactersMetadata:

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: |-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. 

            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.

            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.

            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. 

            *Example*: 

            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

        A tab that allows the recipient to enter an email address.
        This is a one-line field that checks that a valid email
        address is entered. It uses the same parameters as a Text
        tab, with the validation message and pattern set for email
        information.

        When getting information that includes
        this tab type, the original value of the tab when the
        associated envelope was sent is included in the response.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

    emailSettings:
      description: |-
        A complex element that allows  the sender to override some envelope email setting information. This can be used to override the Reply To email address and name associated with the envelope and to override the BCC email addresses to which an envelope is sent. 

        When the emailSettings information is used for an envelope, it only applies to that envelope. 

        **IMPORTANT:** The emailSettings information is not returned in the GET for envelope status. Use GET /email_settings to return information about the emailSettings. 

        EmailSettings consists of: 

        * replyEmailAddressOverride - The Reply To email used for the envelope. DocuSign will verify that a correct email format is used, but does not verify that the email is active. Maximum Length: 100 characters.
        * replyEmailNameOverride - The name associated with the Reply To email address. Maximum Length: 100 characters.
        * bccEmailAddresses - An array of up to five email addresses to which the envelope is sent to as a BCC email. Only users with canManageAccount setting set to true can use this option. 
        DocuSign verifies that the email format is correct, but does not verify that the email is active. Using this overrides the BCC for Email Archive information setting for this envelope. Maximum Length: 100 characters.
        *Example*: if your account has BCC for Email Archive set up for the email address 'archive@mycompany.com' and you send an envelope using the BCC Email Override to send a BCC email to 'salesarchive@mycompany.com', then a copy of the envelope is only sent to the 'salesarchive@mycompany.com' email address.

            This object specifies the template recipients. Each `roleName` in the template must have a recipient assigned to it. This object is comprised of the following elements:

            * `email`: The recipient's email address.
            * `name`: The recipient's name.
            * `roleName`: The template roleName associated with the recipient.
            * `clientUserId`: An optional property that specifies whether the recipient is embedded or remote. If the `clientUserId` is not null, then the recipient is embedded. Note that if a `clientUserId` is used and the account settings `signerMustHaveAccount` or `signerMustLoginToSign` are **true,** an error is generated on sending.
            * `defaultRecipient`: Optional, When **true,** this recipient is the default recipient and any tabs generated by the `transformPdfFields` option are mapped to this recipient.
            * `routingOrder`: This specifies the routing order of the recipient in the envelope.
            * `accessCode`: This optional element specifies the access code a recipient has to enter to validate the identity. Maximum Length: 50 characters.
            * `inPersonSignerName`: Optional. If the template role is an in-person signer, this is the full legal name of the signer. Maximum Length: 100 characters.
            * `emailNotification`: This is an optional complex element that has a role-specific `emailSubject`, `emailBody`, and `language`. It follows the same format as the `emailNotification` property for recipients.
            * `tabs`: This property enables the tab values to be specified for matching to tabs in the template.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

        When the recipient completes the underlying fields,
        the formula tab calculates and displays the result.

        The `formula` property of the tab
        contains the references

        If a formula tab contains
        a `paymentDetails` property,

          description: |
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            enclosed in brackets,
            to refer to it.

            For example,
            you want to present the total cost
            of two items, tax included.

            The cost of each item is stored
            in number tabs labeled Item1 and Item2.
            The tax rate is in a number tab
            labeled TaxRate.

            The formula string for this property
            would be:
            `([Item1] + [Item2]) * (1 + [TaxRate])`

      x-ms-summary: |
        The value of a formula tab is calculated
        from the values of other
        number or date tabs in the document.
        When the recipient completes the underlying fields,
        the formula tab calculates and displays the result.

        The `formula` property of the tab
        contains the references
        to the underlying tabs.
        See [Calculated Fields][calculatedfields]
        in the DocuSign Support Center
        to learn more about formulas.

        If a formula tab contains
        a `paymentDetails` property,
        the tab is considered a payment item.
        See [Requesting Payments Along with Signatures][paymentguide]
        in the DocuSign Support Center
        to learn more about payments.

        anchorAllowWhiteSpaceInCharacters:
          description: |
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

        anchorAllowWhiteSpaceInCharactersMetadata:

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

          description: |
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: |-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. 

            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.

            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.

            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. 

            *Example*: 

            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

            When enforce signer visibility is enabled, documents with tabs can only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document. Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

        anchorMatchWholeWord:
          description: |
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).


            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: |-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. 

            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.

            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.

            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. 

            *Example*: 

            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

            When enforce signer visibility is enabled, documents with tabs can only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document. Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

        anchorMatchWholeWord:
          description: |
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).


            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

        anchorMatchWholeWord:
          description: |
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: |-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. 

            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.

            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.

            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. 

            *Example*: 

            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: |-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. 

            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.

            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.

            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. 

            *Example*: 

            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

            When enforce signer visibility is enabled, documents with tabs can only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document. Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            Use a tab's `tabLabel`,
            enclosed in brackets,
            to refer to it.

            For example,
            you want to present the total cost
            of two items, tax included.

            The cost of each item is stored
            in number tabs labeled Item1 and Item2.
            The tax rate is in a number tab
            labeled TaxRate.

            The formula string for this property
            would be:
            `([Item1] + [Item2]) * (1 + [TaxRate])`

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: |-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. 

            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.

            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.

            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. 

            *Example*: 

            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

            - `carbonCopy`: Carbon copy recipients get a copy of the envelope but don't need to sign, initial, date, or add information to any of the documents. This type of recipient can be used in any routing order.
            - `certifiedDelivery`: Certified delivery recipients must receive the completed documents for the envelope to be completed. They don't need to sign, initial, date, or add information to any of the documents.
            - `editor`: Editors have the same management and access rights for the envelope as the sender. Editors can add name and email information, add or change the routing order, set authentication options, and can edit signature/initial tabs and data fields for the remaining recipients.
            - `inPersonSigner`: In-person recipients are DocuSign users who act as signing hosts in the same physical location as the signer.
            - `intermediaries`: Intermediary recipients can optionally add name and email information for recipients at the same or subsequent level in the routing order.
            - `seal`: Electronic seal recipients represent legal entities.
            - `signer`: Signers are recipients who must sign, initial, date, or add data to form fields on the documents in the envelope.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**
          type: string
        anchorAllowWhiteSpaceInCharactersMetadata:

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            - `email`: Verifies the recipient's identity using email authentication before the recipient can sign a document. The recipient enters their email address and then clicks **Begin Signing** to begin the signing process. The system then sends an email message with a validation code for the PowerForm to the recipient. If the recipient does not provide a valid email address, they cannot open and sign the document.  
            - `direct`: Does not require any verification. After a recipient enters their email address and clicks **Begin Signing,** a new browser tab opens and the recipient can immediately begin the signing process. Because the recipient's identity is not verified by using email authentication, we strongly recommend that you only use the `direct` signing mode when the PowerForm is accessible behind a secure portal where the recipient's identity is already authenticated, or where another form of authentication is specified for the recipient in the DocuSign template (for example, an access code, phone authentication, or ID check).

            This is a one-line field that checks that a valid email

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**
          type: string

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

          description: |
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

    sealSign:
      description: |
        Specifies one or more electronic seals to apply on documents. An electronic seal recipient is a legal entity rather than an actual person. Electronic Seals can be used by organizations and governments to show evidence of origin and integrity of documents. Even though electronic seals can be represented by a tab in a document, they do not require user interaction and apply automatically in the order specified by the sender. The sender is therefore the person authorizing usage of the electronic seal in the flow.

        Example: 

        ```json
        "recipients": {
              "seals": [
                {
                  "recipientId": "1",
                  "routingOrder" : 1,
                  "recipientSignatureProviders": [
                    {
                      "sealName": "52e9d968-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-4682bc45c106"
                    }

      x-ms-summary: |
        Specifies one or more electronic seals to apply on documents. An electronic seal recipient is a legal entity rather than an actual person. Electronic Seals can be used by organizations and governments to show evidence of origin and integrity of documents. Even though electronic seals can be represented by a tab in a document, they do not require user interaction and apply automatically in the order specified by the sender. The sender is therefore the person authorizing usage of the electronic seal in the flow.

        Example: 

        ```json
        "recipients": {
              "seals": [
                {
                  "recipientId": "1",
                  "routingOrder" : 1,
                  "recipientSignatureProviders": [
                    {
                      "sealName": "52e9d968-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-4682bc45c106"
                    }
              	]
            	}
          	]
        	},
            .
            .
            .
        ```

          description: |
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**
          type: string
        anchorAllowWhiteSpaceInCharactersMetadata:

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

          description: |
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**
          type: string
        anchorAllowWhiteSpaceInCharactersMetadata:

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: |-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. 

            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.

            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.

            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. 

            *Example*: 

            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

            When enforce signer visibility is enabled, documents with tabs can only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document. Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**
          type: string

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

        anchorMatchWholeWord:
          description: |
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: |-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. 

            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.

            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.

            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. 

            *Example*: 

            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

          description: |
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

          description: |
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

            Use a tab's `tabLabel`,
            enclosed in brackets,
            to refer to it.

            For example,
            you want to present the total cost
            of two items, tax included.

            The cost of each item is stored
            in number tabs labeled Item1 and Item2.
            The tax rate is in a number tab
            labeled TaxRate.

            The formula string for this property
            would be:
            `([Item1] + [Item2]) * (1 + [TaxRate])`

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

        anchorAllowWhiteSpaceInCharactersMetadata:

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

          description: |
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

        anchorMatchWholeWord:
          description: |
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).


            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: |-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. 

            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.

            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.

            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. 

            *Example*: 

            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

            When enforce signer visibility is enabled, documents with tabs can only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document. Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two cases.

            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `Docu Sign` will match. However, <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.

            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.

            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

          description: |
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

      The eSignature API Envelope category includes the resources and methods for sending and managing envelopes and envelope data.

      Envelopes are the key objects in the DocuSign platform. As a result, they are complex data structures with few required fields. See the [How-to guides](/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/) for examples and solutions.

      To learn more about envelopes, see [Envelopes](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/envelopes/).
    name: Envelopes
    summary: This section shows you how to create and send envelopes.
  - description: |
      The Connect service enables your application to be called via
      HTTPS when an event of interest occurs.

      Use the Connect service to "end the polling madness." With
      Connect, there is no need for your application to poll DocuSign
      every 15 minutes to learn the latest about your envelopes.

      Instead, you register your interest in one or more types of
      envelope or recipient events. Then, when an interesting event
      occurs, the DocuSign platform will contact your application with
      the event's details and data. You can register interest in
      envelopes sent by particular users in your account, or for
      envelopes sent by any user.

      Connect can empower your organization to manage document actions
      as they occur, and allows you to track their changes within your
      own systems. Upon completion, envelope information, including
      document content, can be stored in your own databases or CMS
      systems, and these events can be triggered via webhooks
      delivering messages to your application.

      **Note:** To make API calls to any of the Connect endpoints, you must be an account administrator.

      ## Incoming Connect Calls

      To use the Connect service, your application needs to provide an
      HTTPS URL that can be called from the public Internet. If your
      application runs on a server behind your organization's firewall,
      then you will need to create a "pinhole" in the firewall to allow
      the incoming Connect calls from DocuSign to reach your
      application. You can also use other techniques such as proxy
      servers and DMZ networking for receiving the incoming calls.

      Connect delivers events over HTTP requests in JSON or XML.
      See [DocuSign Connect overview](/platform/webhooks/connect/).

      If your application is not configured to accept post messages,
      DocuSign will NOT return an additional post error response to
      your listener application. If you've enabled logging on your
      configuration, it will be logged in Admin under the configuration
      failure log.

      ## Per-envelope Connect Configuration

      Instead of registering a general Connect configuration and
      listener, an individual envelope can have its own Connect
      configuration. See the
      [`eventNotification`](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopes/create/#schema__envelopedefinition_eventnotification)
      property for envelopes.

      ## Historical Publish Endpoint

      To submit existing envelopes to an endpoint, use the [EnvelopePublish](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopepublish/) resource.
    name: Connect
    summary: |-
      DocuSign Connect is the DocuSign platform notification service. The service uses webhooks to proactively notify your application when an event occurs that your application wants to know about. DocuSign recommends that all applications use Connect instead of polling the DocuSign Signature Service. This section provides information about Connect configuration and logging. 

      **Note:** To make API calls to any of the Connect endpoints, you must be an account administrator.

      For more information about Connect, see [DocuSign Connect](/platform/webhooks/connect/) and [Custom Connect Configuration](https://support.docusign.com/guides/ndse-admin-guide-custom-connect-configuration-htm).

      A workspace is a collaborative space for sharing documents and managing workflows. A workspace has a single owner who must be a DocuSign user. The owner can invite others to the workspace as collaborators. Individuals who are not DocuSign users must create a DocuSign account to join a workspace as a collaborator.
       
      You can create an envelope directly from a workspace.

      Workspaces store the following information:

      - **Files:** Files uploaded to a workspace for storage or reuse.
      - **Documents:** A document is a component of a transaction, template, or workspace. When a file is added to a transaction, template, or workspace, it is copied as a document. Each document in a workspace has a single owner.
      - **Templates:** A set of documents that you can use to create a transaction or a workspace.
      - **Transactions:** A transaction is a series of workflow events related to one or more documents. These events route the documents to one or more individuals for the purposes of doing business. Each transaction has a single owner (the sender).
