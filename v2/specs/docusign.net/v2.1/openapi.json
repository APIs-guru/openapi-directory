The settings associated with a brand are applied to all of the envelopes that use the brand. You can create multiple brand profiles for different corporate brands or internal departments.\n\n**Note:** To use this resource, branding for either signing or sending must be enabled for the account (either `canSelfBrandSend`, `canSelfBrandSign`, or both of these account settings must be set to **true**).

The recipient must read and agree to the terms of the disclosure before they can access and take action on the documents you send. The ERSD does not apply to copy-only recipients, but does apply to recipients who must sign or view your documents.\n\nYou can use either the default ERSD that DocuSign provides for U.S.-based transactions, or a custom ERSD. \n\n## Languages\n\n**Important:** The system does not translate the ERSD for you. The default ERSD is always in English. For a custom ERSD, an account administrator must create a version of the disclosure for each language that your signers use. When you create a version of your custom ERSD for a specific signer language, you must:\n\n1. Specify the language code (`langCode`) for the signer language.\n2. Provide the `esignAgreementText` and `esignText` in the language associated with the `langCode`.\n\nFor more information, see [Legal Disclosure](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/ndse-admin-guide-legal-disclosure).",

When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would, but when the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to this URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, it is up to the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) to then request a recipient token to launch a signing session.<br/><br/>If the value `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN` is used for this node, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation that would be launched by any partner.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application and DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the sending application sets  the `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL` property to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) be used to verify the identity of the recipient.<br/><br>If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` property is set, DocuSign ignores the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` property using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId, recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The customFields must be part of the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets.<br/><br/>_Example_:<br/>`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession?

This information is returned in the envelope status but otherwise not used by DocuSign.

If you are using a zero-decimal currency,\nsuch as Japanese yen, _do not_ multiply by 100.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"documents\": [\n    {\n      \"documentBase64\": \"<base64-encoded PDF document>\",\n

Add a text tab with a descriptive `tabLabel` such as `FuturePayment`.\n2. In the formula tab's `paymentDetails` object, add a `lineItem` object that references the `tabLabel` from step 1.\n\n**Note:** Do not include this new `lineItem` in formula calculations.\n\nThe following example builds on the previous code block to also collect a payment method for future use:\n\n```\n{\n  \"documents\": [\n    {\n      \"documentBase64\": \"<base64-encoded PDF document>\",\n      \"documentId\": \"1\",\n      \"fileExtension\": \"pdf\",\n      \"name\": \"payment.pdf\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"emailSubject\": \"Order Some Books\",\n  \"recipients\": {\n    \"signers\": [\n      {\n        \"email\": \"vreader@example.com\",\n        \"name\": \"Voracious Reader\",\n        \"recipientId\": \"1\",\n        \"routingOrder\": \"1\",\n        \"tabs\": {\n          \"numberTabs\": [\n            {\n              \"value\": \"10.00\",\n              \"width\": 78,\n              \"required\": \"true\",\n              \"locked\": \"true\",\n              \"tabLabel\": \"Hamlet\",\n              \"documentId\": \"1\",\n              \"pageNumber\": \"1\",\n              \"xPosition\": \"323\",\n              \"yPosition\": \"134\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"value\": \"10.00\",\n              \"width\": 78,\n              \"required\": \"true\",\n              \"locked\": \"true\",\n              \"tabLabel\": \"Tempest\",\n              \"documentId\": \"1\",\n              \"pageNumber\": \"1\",\n              \"xPosition\": \"323\",\n              \"yPosition\": \"154\"\n            }\n          ],\n          \"textTabs\": [\n            {\n              \"value\": \"\",\n              \"width\": 78,\n              \"required\": \"true\",\n              \"locked\": \"true\",\n              \"tabLabel\": \"FuturePayment\",\n              \"documentId\": \"1\",\n              \"pageNumber\": \"1\",\n              \"xPosition\": \"323\",\n              \"yPosition\": \"174\"\n            }\n          ],\n          \"formulaTabs\": [\n            {\n              \"required\": \"true\",\n              \"formula\": \"([Hamlet] + [Tempest]) * 100\",\n              \"roundDecimalPlaces\": \"2\",\n              \"paymentDetails\": {\n                \"currencyCode\": \"USD\",\n                \"paymentOption\": \"save_and_authorize\",\n                \"lineItems\": [\n                  {\n                    \"name\": \"Hamlet\",\n                    \"description\": \"The Danish Play\",\n                    \"itemCode\": \"SHAK1\",\n                    \"amountReference\": \"Hamlet\"\n                  },\n                  {\n                    \"name\": \"Othello\",\n                    \"description\": \"The one with Caliban in it\",\n                    \"itemCode\": \"SHAK2\",\n                    \"amountReference\": \"Tempest\"\n                  },\n                  {\n                    \"name\": \"Request books\",\n                    \"description\": \"collect Payment method\",\n                    \"itemCode\": \"\",\n                    \"amountReference\": \"FuturePayment\"\n                  }\n                ],\n                \"gatewayAccountId\": \"e76668b4-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-a208d659e490\"\n              },\n              \"tabLabel\": \"Payment1\",\n              \"documentId\": \"1\",\n              \"pageNumber\": \"1\",\n              \"xPosition\": 300,\n              \"yPosition\": 200\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"status\": \"sent\"\n}\n```\n\n### Some Things to Keep in Mind About Payments\n\n* An envelope is not completed until all payments are completed.\n\n* If you are using a a decimal currency, such as USD,\n  remember to multiply amounts by 100. If you are using\n  zero-decimal currency, such as JPY, _do not_ multiply by 100.\n\n* If a DocuSign account Administrator\n  deletes a payment gateway account connection\n  DocuSign cancels all in-process envelopes\n  that reference the deleted payment gateway account.\n\n* If the sender voids an envelope,\n  all payment authorizations are canceled.\n\n* If a required recipient refuses to sign,\n  all authorized payments are canceled.\n\n* If a required recipient's payment fails authorization,\n  DocuSign attempts to recover\n  by sending the recipient\n  notification about the failed payment authorization.\n  The recipient has the opportunity\n  to correct the payment method information.\n\n* Each recipient's payment is authorized separately.\n  Accounts are charged and payment made\n  after all required tabs are completed,\n  and all payments in an envelope for all recipients are authorized.\n\n* Refunds are not supported.\n  Conduct refunds or payment changes\n  with the payment gateway separately from DocuSign.\n\n* At this time, DocuSign does not charge a per-transaction fee.\n\n\n[enveloperecipientslist]: /docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/enveloperecipients/list/\n[formulatab]:             /docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/enveloperecipienttabs/create/\n[ISO 4217]:                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217\n[numbertab]:              /docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/enveloperecipienttabs/create/\n[paymentgateways]:        https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/managing-payment-gateways\n[paymentguide]:           https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/requesting-payments-along-with-signatures\n[paymentlineitem]:        /docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/enveloperecipienttabs/create/\n[paymentdetails]:         /docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/enveloperecipienttabs/create/\n[stripe]:                 https://stripe.com/\n\n\n## Using Custom Tabs in Envelopes and Templates\n\nCustom Tabs can be added to envelopes and templates\nby setting the `customTabId` property\nwhen creating an envelope or template recipient\nor when adding a new tab for an existing recipient.\nThe custom tab must be added as the correct tab type.\nFor example if the custom tab type is text, it cannot be used as a number tab.\n\nWhen the `customTabId` property is set,\nthe new tab inherits all the custom tab properties.\nRequired information that is not included in the custom tab,\nsuch as document ID and page ID, must be included when adding the tab.\nIf the custom tab does not have anchor settings, the X and Y positions must be included.\n\nAfter the tab is created,\nit is treated as any other tab for updating or deleting.\n\n## Anchoring Tabs\n\nThe tab anchoring option\nallows you to send documents for signature\nthat do not have a fixed layout or format.\nIn these documents you might not know\nthe absolute location of the tabs\nwhen you design your API client application because the tabs must move with text.\nAs an alternative to sending X and Y coordinates for tabs,\nthe DocuSign Service can derive an anchor location for the tab\nby correlating anchor information to data within the document.\n\nWhen the DocuSign Service receives a request that contains tabs\nwith anchor information,\nit searches the document for instances of the `anchorString` property.\nWhen found,\nit places a tab of the specified type for the designated recipient.\nTab positions are established by setting offsets for the tab.\n\nWhen you apply tabs to the document,\nDocuSign does not remove or replace the text in the `anchorString` property. You can hide codified anchors by using the same font color as the background of the document. So the anchor can be used by DocuSign processes and it will not be visible on the document.\n\nTo use an anchoring option:\n\n1. Identify the location in the document by text string. You can use a pre-existing text string or add a new one.\nFor best performance DocuSign recommends using single word anchor strings when possible, especially when there are a large number of pages in the envelope.\nFor example, you might want to add a Sign Here tab to the \"Borrower's Signature\" lines in a document, but that phrase might occur in places in the document where you don't want to tab to appear. In this case, you could add the text \"BorrowerSignHere\" in white font color (so that isn't visible in the document) to all the places you want Sign Here tabs to appear and use \"BorrowerSignHere\" as the anchor string.\n1. Reference the anchor through the `anchorString` property of the tab.\n1. Determine the offset from the anchor string location to where the tab should be placed.\n\nSetting a positive value in the `anchorXOffset` property moves the tab right on the page and positive values in the  `anchorYoffset` prove moves the tab down the page. The `anchorUnits` property specifies the units used for the offsets.\nFor Sign Here and Initial Here tabs the bottom-left of the anchor string is equivalent to position (0,0), and the bottom-left of the tab graphic is placed relative to that.\nFor all other tabs the bottom-left of the anchor string is equivalent to position (0,0), and the top-left of the tab graphic is placed relative to that.\nDocuSign does not currently provide tools to derive the offset values. Determination of the proper offset will likely require some trial-and-error.\n\n### Rules for working with anchor tags\n\nWhen anchor tabs are used, all documents in the envelope are searched for the `anchorString` property.\n\n* You set the text of the anchor string in the `anchorString` property. DocuSign tabs are created for each instance of the `anchorString` property within the document, so special care must be taken to establish unique anchor strings that do not result in unintentional tabs.\n* You cannot use the same anchored tab for different recipients for the same document.\n* The DocuSign system cannot search for text that is embedded in an image when checking for anchor strings.\n* X or Y offsets supplied for a tab apply to all instances of the tab in the document. To use different offsets at different locations in the document for the same recipient, create multiple, unique anchor tabs.\n* If the Y offset value of an anchor string would force a tab outside of the page boundaries, the tag is placed at the page boundary. If the X offset value places a tab outside of the page boundaries, the error message `Invalid_User_Offset` is sent. The error message includes the X offset that resulted in the error.\n* The system does not support an anchor string embedded in the form of a PDF X-object in the document.\n* The system does not re-flow the text that surrounds the anchor tabs. It is the responsibility of the document author to provide sufficient white space to contain the potential width of the ultimate tab value.\n\n### Tips and Tricks\n\nThe following are tips for effective use of anchor tags:\n* In order to avoid unintentional conflicts between text contained in an `anchorString` property and the text that naturally exists in documents, establish a codified syntax for the anchor string text that is unlikely to appear elsewhere in a document.\n* Develop an extensible and consistent syntax that can be used across multiple document types.\n* Especially for documents that have variable numbers of tabs or signers, author the source document to include hidden anchor tabs for all potential signers/permutations. Then, control the tabs that are actually placed by including/excluding the anchor tabs in the request. This approach allows a single document to be used for all use cases instead of maintaining separate documents for each scenario.\n\n## Automatically Populating Tabs\n\nIf you want similar tab types\nto automatically populate with the same data,\nyou must follow these guidelines:\n\n* Each `tabLabel` entry must have the characters\n  `\\\\*` in front of the label.\n  If you omit the `\\\\*` prefix,\n  only the first occurrence of the tab is populated.\n\n  When automatically populating tabs,\n  the `tabLabel` must not contain any spaces.\n  In the JSON example below,\n  the Text tabs  properties `StudentLastName` and `StudentFirstName`\n  will be auto-populated as specified (\"Doe\" and \"John\")\n  each place they appear throughout the envelope.\n\n  ```\n  \"tabs\": {\n    \"textTabs\": [\n    {\n      \"tabLabel\": \"\\\\*StudentLastName\",\n      \"value\": \"Doe\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"tabLabel\": \"\\\\*StudentFirstName\",\n      \"value\": \"John\"\n    }]\n  }\n  ```\n\n* Note that `\\\\*` matches _anything_.  If you were to add\n  another tab with the `tabLabel` set to `\\\\*Name` to the\n  example above, it would end up matching the other two\n  labels as well.\n\n* Each occurrence of the tab must have identical properties.\n\n  For example, suppose there are two Text tabs in a document,\n  each with `tabLabel` set to `Name`.\n  If one tab has the `bold` property set to **true,**\n  and the other has the `bold` property set to **false,**\n  only the first one will be populated.\n  In order to automatically populate both occurrences\n  of the `Name` Text tabs,\n  the `bold` property must be set to the same value for both tabs.\n",

      "description": "Standards-Based Signatures (SBS) is the label used to describe DocuSign's suite of signatures that comply with regional and industry regulations, such as the electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services (eIDAS) regulation in Europe.\n\n## Feature Differences When Using Standards-Based Signatures\n\nSome DocuSign features are not compatible with Standards-Based Signatures, while others work somewhat differently. It's important to understand these key differences.\n\n### DocuSign Features Not Compatible with SBS\n\n- Attachment by fax\n- Concatenation of signer attachments\n- Legacy digital signatures\n- Markup\n- Notary\n\n### DocuSign Features That Change with SBS\n\nThe following features work slightly differently with SBS:\n\n- **Advanced Correct:** After the first signature, adding or deleting a field is not allowed. This behavior occurs because SBS does not allow adding or removing form fields after a digital signature has already been applied to a PDF.\n- **Downloading Combined Envelopes:** A combined PDF is not digitally signed. This behavior occurs because concatenating digitally signed PDFs breaks the digital signatures on the PDFs.\n- **Freeform Signing:** After someone has signed, allows only signature and initials on free-form. This behavior occurs because if another signer has already signed the document, adding fields other than signature fields will break the existing digital signatures on the document.\n- **Watermarks:** All watermarks are added as PDF annotations. This behavior occurs because burning the watermark into the PDF will break the digital signatures on the document.\n- **Wet Signing:** Wet-signed documents are added as new documents to envelopes. This behavior results in the uploaded or faxed, physically signed document being added as a new document to the envelope. This new document gets only a platform seal.\n\nFor more information, see [Standards Based Signatures](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/standards-based-signatures/).",

If you are working in the development environment, all recipient types are available.\n\nEach recipient type is described below:\n\n[Agents](#agents): This recipient can add name and email information for recipients that appear after the recipient in routing order.\n\n[Carbon Copies](#carboncopies): Use this action if the recipient should get a copy of the template, but the recipient does not need to sign, initial, date or add information to any of the documents. This type of recipient can be placed in any order in the recipient list. The recipient receives a copy of the template when the template reaches the recipient's order in the process flow and when the template is completed.\n\n[Certified Deliveries](#certifiedDeliveries): Use this action if the recipient must receive the completed documents for the template to be completed, but the recipient does not need to sign, initial, date or add information to any of the documents.\n\n[Editors](#editors): This recipient has the same management and access rights for the template as the sender and can make changes to the template as if they were using the Advanced Correct feature. This recipient can add name and email information, add or change the routing order and set authentication options for the remaining recipients. Additionally, this recipient can edit signature/initial tabs and data fields for the remaining recipients. The recipient must have a DocuSign account to be an editor.\n\n[In Person Signers](#inPerson): Use this action if the signer is in the same physical location as a DocuSign user who will act as a Signing Host for the transaction. The recipient added is the Signing Host and new separate Signer Name field appears after Sign in person is selected.\n\n[Intermediaries](#intermediaries): This recipient can, but is not required to, add name and email information for recipients at the same or subsequent level in the routing order (until subsequent Agents, Editors or Intermediaries recipient types are added).\n\n[Signers](#signers): Use this action if your recipient must sign, initial, date or add data to form fields on the documents in the template.\n\n### Core JSON Layout\n\nThe following shows the core JSON layout for a recipient.\n\n```\n\"email\": \"email.name@company.com\",\n  \"name\": \"recipient name\",\n  \"accessCode\": \"\",\n  \"addAccessCodeToEmail\": false,\n  \"clientUserIs\": null,\n  \"embeddedRecipientStartURL\": \"string\",\n  \"customFields\": {\n    \"sample string 1\",\n    \"sample string 2\"\n  },\n  \"emailNotification\"{\n    \"emailBody\":\"email text\",\n    \"emailSubject\":\"Subject text\",\n    \"supportedLanguage\":\"en\",\n  },\n  \"excludedDocuments\": [\"2\", \"4\"],\n  \"idCheckConfigurationName\": null,\n  \"idCheckInformationInput\": {\n    \"addressInformationInput\": {\n      \"addressInformation\": {\n        \"street1\": \"sample string 1\",\n        \"street2\": \"sample string 2\",\n        \"city\": \"sample string 3\",\n        \"state\": \"sample string 4\",\n        \"zip\": \"sample string 5\",\n        \"zipPlus4\": \"sample string 6\"\n      },\n      \"displayLevelCode\": \"sample string 1\",\n      \"receiveInResponse\": \"sample string 2\"\n    },\n    \"dobInformationInput\": {\n      \"dateOfBirth\": \"sample string 1\",\n      \"displayLevelCode\": \"sample string 2\",\n      \"receiveInResponse\": \"sample string 3\"\n    },\n    \"ssn4InformationInput\": {\n      \"ssn4\": \"sample string 1\",\n      \"displayLevelCode\": \"sample string 2\",\n      \"receiveInResponse\": \"sample string 3\"\n    },\n    \"ssn9InformationInput\": {\n      \"ssn9\": \"sample string 1\",\n      \"displayLevelCode\": \"sample string 2\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"inheritEmailNotificationConfiguration\": false,\n  \"note\": \"\",\n  \"phoneAuthentication\": {\n    \"recipMayProvideNumber\": \"sample string 1\",\n    \"validateRecipProvidedNumber\": \"sample string 2\",\n    \"recordVoicePrint\": \"sample string 3\",\n    \"senderProvidedNumbers\": [\n      \"sample string 1\",\n      \"sample string 2\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"recipientAttachment\": null,\n  \"recipientCaptiveInfo\": null,\n  \"recipientId\": \"1\",\n  \"requireIdLookup\": false,\n  \"roleName\": \"\",\n  \"routingOrder\": 1,\n  \"samlAuthentication\": {\n    \"samlAssertionAttributes\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"string\",\n        \"value\": \"string\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"string\",\n        \"value\": \"string\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"smsAuthentication\": {\n    \"senderProvidedNumbers\":[\n      \"sample string 1\",\n      \"sample string 2\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"socialAuthentications\": null,\n  \"templateAccessCodeRequired\": false,\n  \"templateLocked\": false,\n  \"templateRequired\": false,\n...\n```\n\n### Core Recipient Parameters\n\nThe following table contains the descriptions for the core properties for a recipient.\n\n| Name | Required? | Schema Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| email | Yes | Email | Email of the recipient. Notification will be sent to this email id.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters. |\n| name | Yes | String | Full legal name of the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters. |\n| accessCode | No | String | This optional element specifies the access code a recipient has to enter to validate the identity.<br/>Maximum Length: 50 characters. |\n| addAccessCodeToEmail | No | Boolean | This optional attribute indicates that the access code is added to the email sent to the recipient; this nullifies the Security measure of Access Code on the recipient. |\n| clientUserId | No | String | This specifies whether the recipient is embedded or remote.<br/><br/>If the `clientUserId` property is not null then the recipient is embedded. Note that if the `ClientUserId` property is set and either `SignerMustHaveAccount` or `SignerMustLoginToSign` property of the account settings is set to  **true,** an error is generated on sending. |\n| embeddedRecipientStartURL | No | String | This is a sender provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would, but when the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to this URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, it is up to the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) to then request a recipient token to launch a signing session.<br/><br/>If the value `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN` is used for this node, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation that would be launched by any partner.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application and DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the sending application sets  the `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL` property to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) be used to verify the identity of the recipient.<br/><br>If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` property is set, DocuSign ignores the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` property using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: templateId, recipientId, recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The customFields must be part of the recipient or template. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets.<br/><br/>_Example_:<br/>`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]` |\n| customFields | No | customField |An optional array of strings that allows the sender to provide custom data about the recipient. This information is returned in the template status but otherwise not used by DocuSign. String `customField` properties have a maximum length of 100 characters. |\n| emailNotification | No | emailNotification | An optional complex type that has information for setting the language for the recipient's email information. It is composed of three elements:<br/><br/>*emailBody*: a string with the email message sent to the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length: 10000 characters.<br/><br/>*emailSubject*: a string with the subject of the email sent to the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters.<br/><br/>*supportedLanguage*: The simple type enumeration of the language used. The supported languages, with the language value shown in parenthesis, are: Arabic (ar), Bahasa Indonesia (id), Bahasa Melayu (ms) Bulgarian (bg), Czech (cs), Chinese Simplified (zh_CN), Chinese Traditional (zh_TW), Croatian (hr), Danish (da), Dutch (nl), English US (en), English UK (en_GB), Estonian (et), Farsi (fa), Finnish (fi), French (fr), French Canada (fr_CA), German (de), Greek (el), Hebrew (he), Hindi (hi), Hungarian (hu), Italian (it), Japanese (ja), Korean (ko), Latvian (lv), Lithuanian (lt), Norwegian (no), Polish (pl), Portuguese (pt), Portuguese Brazil (pt_BR), Romanian (ro),Russian (ru), Serbian (sr), Slovak (sk), Slovenian (sl), Spanish (es),Spanish Latin America (es_MX), Swedish (sv), Thai (th), Turkish (tr), Ukrainian (uk) and Vietnamese (vi).<br/><br/>**IMPORTANT:** If this is enabled for one recipient, it overrides the Template Subject and `EmailBlurb` property settings. Also, you must set the  `emailNotification` property for all recipients. |\n| excludedDocuments | No | Array of Strings | Specifies the documents that are not visible to this recipient. Document Visibility must be enabled for the account and the enforceSignerVisibility property must be set to true for the template to use this.<br/><br/>When the enforceSignerVisibility property is set to **true,** documents with tabs can only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document. Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an template, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an template is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an template is sent. |\n| idCheckConfigurationName | No | String |Specifies authentication check by name. The names used here must be the same as the authentication type names used by the account (these name can also be found in the web console sending interface in the Identify list for a recipient). This overrides any default authentication setting.<br/><br/>_Example_:<br/> Your account has ID Check and SMS Authentication available and in the web console Identify list these appear as 'ID Check $' and 'SMS Auth $'. To use ID check in an template, the `idCheckConfigurationName` property must be  set to `ID Check $`. To use SMS, it must be set to `SMS Auth $` and you must add phone number information to the `smsAuthentication` node.|\n| iDCheckInformationInput | No | IdCheckInformationInput | This complex element contains input information related to a recipient ID check. It can include the following information.<br/><br/>*addressInformationInput*: Used to set recipient address information and consists of:<br/><br/>*addressInformation*: consists of six elements, with street2 and zipPlus4 being optional.

If the recipient clicks the Approve tab during the signing process, the recipient is considered to have signed the document. No information is shown on the document for the approval, but it is recorded as a signature in the envelope history. |\n| Checkbox Tab          | Place this tab on the document in a location where the recipient can select a yes/no (on/off) type option. |\n| Company Tab           | Place this tab on the document where you want the recipient's company name to appear. |\n| Date Signed Tab       | Place this tab on the document where you want the date the recipient signed the document to appear. |\n| Date Tab              | Place this tab on the document where you want the recipient to enter a date. Date tabs are single-line fields that allow date information to be entered in any format. The tooltip for this tab recommends entering the date as MM/DD/YYYY, but this is not enforced. The format entered by the signer is retained. If you need a particular date format enforced, DocuSign recommends using a Text tab with a Validation Pattern and Validation Message to enforce the format. |\n| Decline Tab           | Place this tab on the document where you want to give the recipient the option of declining an envelope. If the recipient clicks the Decline tab during the signing process, the envelope is voided. |\n| Email Address Tab     | Place this tab on a document where you want the recipient's email, as entered in the recipient information, to appear. |\n| Email Tab             | This is a single-line field that accepts all characters. |\n| Envelope ID Tab       | Place this tab on the document where you want the envelope ID for to appear. Recipients cannot enter or change the information in this tab. It is for informational purposes only. |\n| First Name Tab        | Place this tab on a document where you want the recipient's first name to appear. This tab splits the recipient's name (as entered in the recipient information) into sections based on spaces and uses the first section as the first name. |\n| Formula Tab           | This tab is used to add a calculated field to a document. Envelope recipients cannot directly enter information into the tab. The formula tab calculates and displays a new value when changes are made to the reference tab values. The reference tab information and calculation operations are entered in the \"formula\" element. See the Using the Calculated Fields Feature quick start guide or DocuSign Service User Guide for more information about formulas.  |\n| Full Name Tab         | Place this tab on the document where you want the recipient's full name to appear. |\n| Initial Here Tab      | Place this tab where the recipient must initial the document. This tab can be set to be optional.  |\n| Last Name Tab         | Place this tab on a document where you want the recipient's last name to appear. This tab splits the recipient's name (as entered in the recipient information) into sections based on spaces and uses the last section as the last name. |\n| List Tab              | This tab has a list of options that a recipient can select. The `listItems` parameter is used to set the options that can be selected.  |\n| Note Tab              | Place this tab on the document where you want to add a note for the recipient on a document. |\n| Number Tab            | This tab is a field where the recipient can enter numbers and decimal (.) points.  |\n| Radio Group Tab       | This group tab is used to place radio buttons on a document. The `radios` parameter is used to add and place the radio buttons associated with the group. Only one radio button can be selected in a group.  |\n| Sign Here Tab         | Place this tab where the recipient must sign the document. This tab can be set to be optional.  |\n| Signer Attachment Tab | The signer attachment is where the recipient initiates the process of adding supporting documents to an envelope. |\n| SSN Tab               | This tab is a single-line field where the recipient can enter numbers. A Social Security Number can be typed with or without dashes. |\n| Text Tab              | This tab is a field where the recipient can enter any type of characters.  |\n| Title Tab             | Place this tab on the document where you want the recipient's title to appear. |\n| Zip Tab               | This tab is a single-line field where the recipient can enter numbers. |\n\n\n## Using Custom Tabs in Envelopes and Templates \n\nCustom Tabs can be added to envelopes and templates\nby setting the `customTabId` property\nwhen creating an envelope or template recipient\nor when adding a new tab for an existing recipient.\nThe custom tab must be added as the correct tab type.\nFor example if the custom tab type is text, it cannot be used as a number tab.\n\nWhen the `customTabId` property is set,\nthe new tab inherits all the custom tab properties.\nRequired information that is not included in the custom tab,\nsuch as document ID and page ID, must be included when adding the tab.\nIf the custom tab does not have anchor settings, the X and Y positions must be included.\n\nAfter the tab is created,\nit is treated as any other tab for updating or deleting. \n\n## Anchoring Tabs\n\nThe tab anchoring option\nallows you to send documents for signature\nthat do not have a fixed layout or format.\nIn these documents you might not know\nthe absolute location of the tabs\nwhen you design your API client application because the tabs must move with text.\nAs an alternative to sending X and Y coordinates for tabs,\nthe DocuSign Service can derive an anchor location for the tab\nby correlating anchor information to data within the document.\n\nWhen the DocuSign Service receives a request that contains tabs\nwith anchor information,\nit searches the document for instances of the `anchorString` property.\nWhen found,\nit places a tab of the specified type for the designated recipient.\nTab positions are established by setting offsets for the tab.\n\nWhen you apply tabs to the document,\nDocuSign does not remove or replace the text in the `anchorString` property. You can hide codified anchors by using the same font color as the background of the document. So the anchor can be used by DocuSign processes and it will not be visible on the document.\n\nTo use an anchoring option:\n\n1. Identify the location in the document by text string. You can use a pre-existing text string or add a new one.\nFor best performance DocuSign recommends using single word anchor strings when possible, especially when there are a large number of pages in the envelope. \nFor example, you might want to add a Sign Here tab to the \"Borrower's Signature\" lines in a document, but that phrase might occur in places in the document where you don't want to tab to appear. In this case, you could add the text \"BorrowerSignHere\" in white font color (so that isn't visible in the document) to all the places you want Sign Here tabs to appear and use \"BorrowerSignHere\" as the anchor string. \n1. Reference the anchor through the `anchorString` property of the tab.\n1. Determine the offset from the anchor string location to where the tab should be placed. \n\nSetting a positive value in the `anchorXOffset` property moves the tab right on the page and positive values in the  `anchorYoffset` prove moves the tab down the page. The `anchorUnits` property specifies the units used for the offsets.\nFor Sign Here and Initial Here tabs the bottom-left of the anchor string is equivalent to position (0,0), and the bottom-left of the tab graphic is placed relative to that.\nFor all other tabs the bottom-left of the anchor string is equivalent to position (0,0), and the top-left of the tab graphic is placed relative to that.\nDocuSign does not currently provide tools to derive the offset values. Determination of the proper offset will likely require some trial-and-error.\n\n### Rules for working with anchor tags\n\nWhen anchor tabs are used, all documents in the envelope are searched for the `anchorString` property.\n\n* You set the text of the anchor string in the `anchorString` property. DocuSign tabs are created for each instance of the `anchorString` property within the document, so special care must be taken to establish unique anchor strings that do not result in unintentional tabs.\n* You cannot use the same anchored tab for different recipients for the same document.\n* The DocuSign system cannot search for text that is embedded in an image when checking for anchor strings.\n* X or Y offsets supplied for a tab apply to all instances of the tab in the document. To use different offsets at different locations in the document for the same recipient, create multiple, unique anchor tabs.\n* If the Y offset value of an anchor string would force a tab outside of the page boundaries, the tag is placed at the page boundary. If the X offset value places a tab outside of the page boundaries, the error message `Invalid_User_Offset` is sent. The error message includes the X offset that resulted in the error.\n* The system does not support an anchor string embedded in the form of a PDF X-object in the document.\n* The system does not re-flow the text that surrounds the anchor tabs. It is the responsibility of the document author to provide sufficient white space to contain the potential width of the ultimate tab value.\n\n### Tips and Tricks\n\nThe following are tips for effective use of anchor tags:\n* In order to avoid unintentional conflicts between text contained in an `anchorString` property and the text that naturally exists in documents, establish a codified syntax for the anchor string text that is unlikely to appear elsewhere in a document.\n* Develop an extensible and consistent syntax that can be used across multiple document types.\n* Especially for documents that have variable numbers of tabs or signers, author the source document to include hidden anchor tabs for all potential signers/permutations. Then, control the tabs that are actually placed by including/excluding the anchor tabs in the request. This approach allows a single document to be used for all use cases instead of maintaining separate documents for each scenario.\n\n## Automatically Populating Tabs\n\nIf you want similar tab types\nto automatically populate with the same data,\nyou must follow these guidelines:\n\n* Each `tabLabel` entry must have the characters\n  `\\\\*` in front of the label.\n  If you omit the `\\\\*` prefix,\n  only the first occurrence of the tab is populated.\n\n  When automatically populating tabs,\n  the `tabLabel` must not contain any spaces.\n  In the JSON example below,\n  the Text tabs  properties `StudentLastName` and `StudentFirstName`\n  will be auto-populated as specified (\"Doe\" and \"John\")\n  each place they appear throughout the envelope.\n\n  ```\n  \"tabs\": {\n    \"textTabs\": [\n    {\n      \"tabLabel\": \"\\\\*StudentLastName\",\n      \"value\": \"Doe\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"tabLabel\": \"\\\\*StudentFirstName\",\n      \"value\": \"John\"\n    }]\n  }\n  ```\n\n* Each occurrence of the tab must have identical properties.\n\n  For example, suppose there are two Text tabs in a document,\n  each with `tabLabel` set to `Name`.\n  If one tab has the `bold` property set to **true,**\n  and the other has the `bold` property set to **false,**\n  only the first one will be populated.\n  In order to automatically populate both occurrences\n  of the `Name` Text tabs,\n  the `bold` property must be set to the same value for both tabs.\n",

If you are using a template, you must either match the recipient IDs or role IDs.\n- The envelope cannot contain a bulk recipient (an artifact of the legacy version of DocuSign's bulk send\n  functionality).\n\n**Recipient Tabs**\n\n- Every `recipient ID, tab label` pair in the bulk send list must correspond to a tab in the envelope.\n\n**Custom Fields**\n\n- Each envelope-level custom field in the bulk send list must correspond to the name of a `customField` in the\n  envelope definition.

You can use this endpoint to create:\n* Account-level Connect configurations to listen for events related to any envelopes sent by one or more account users\n* Recipient Connect configurations that are triggered when one or more of your account users receive an envelope\n\nTo set an account-level configuration, set `configurationType` to **custom.**\nTo set a Recipient Connect configuration, set `configurationType` to **customrecipient.**\n\nIf you want to listen for events on only one envelope, use the [eventNotification](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopes/create/#schema__envelopedefinition_eventnotification) object instead.\n\n**Note:** To use this function, you must be an account administrator and Connect must be enabled on your account.\n\n## Data models\n\nThere are four possible data models for your Connect configuration. Consider:\n* Do you want the data in JSON or XML?\n* Do you want events sent individually (SIM) or in aggregate?\n\nDocuSign recommends using the [JSON SIM event model](/platform/webhooks/connect/improved-json-sim-event-model/).\n\n<ds-column>\n\n<ds-step open=\"false\" hideIcon=\"true\">\n<h3>JSON SIM (Recommended)</h3>\n<div>\n\nSet `deliveryMode` to **SIM** and `eventData.version` to **restv2.1.** Use the `events` property to set the event statuses that will trigger your configuration.\n\nThe following sample request shows how to create an envelope-level configuration using JSON SIM:\n```\n{\n  \"configurationType\": \"custom\",\n  \"urlToPublishTo\": \"YOUR-WEBHOOK-URL\",\n  \"allUsers\": \"true\",\n  \"name\": \"jsonSimTest\",\n  \"deliveryMode\": \"SIM\",\n  \"allowEnvelopePublish\": \"true\",\n  \"enableLog\": \"true\",\n  \"eventData\": {\n      \"version\": \"restv2.1\"\n  },\n  \"events\": [\n      \"envelope-sent\",\n      \"envelope-delivered\",\n      \"envelope-completed\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe following sample request shows how to create a Recipient Connect configuration using JSON SIM:\n```\n{\n  \"configurationType\": \"customrecipient\",\n  \"urlToPublishTo\": \"YOUR-WEBHOOK-URL\",\n  \"allUsers\": \"true\",\n  \"name\": \"jsonSimTest\",\n  \"deliveryMode\": \"SIM\",\n  \"allowEnvelopePublish\": \"true\",\n  \"enableLog\": \"true\",\n  \"eventData\": {\n      \"version\": \"restv2.1\"\n  },\n  \"events\": [\n      \"recipient-sent\",\n      \"recipient-completed\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n</div></ds-step>\n\n<ds-step open=\"false\" hideIcon=\"true\">\n<h3>JSON Aggregate</h3>\n<div>\n\nSet `deliveryMode` to **aggregate** and `eventData.version` to **restv2.1.** Use the `envelopeEvents` or `recipientEvents` property to set the event statuses that will trigger your configuration.\n\n</div></ds-step>\n\n<ds-step open=\"false\" hideIcon=\"true\">\n<h3>XML Aggregate</h3>\n<div>\n\nSet `deliveryMode` to **aggregate.** Use the `envelopeEvents` or `recipientEvents` property to set the event statuses that will trigger your configuration.\n\n</div></ds-step>\n\n<ds-step open=\"false\" hideIcon=\"true\">\n<h3>XML SIM (Legacy apps only)</h3>\n<div>\n\n**Note:** This model [will be deprecated](https://www.docusign.com/blog/developers/docusign-connect-xml-sim-messaging-format-deprecated). \n\nSet `deliveryMode` to **SIM.** Use the `envelopeEvents` or `recipientEvents` property to set the event statuses that will trigger your configuration.\n\n</div></ds-step>\n</ds-column>\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf your configuration is not working, check the following.\n\n* Connect must be enabled for your account to use this function.\n* If you are using `envelopeEvents` or `recipientEvents`, make sure that the event values are sentence case, not lowercase.\n* Make sure you have either set `allUsers` to **true** or set `userIds` to a non-empty array of IDs.\n* By default, this endpoint creates a disabled configuration. To enable the configuration immediately, set the body parameter `allowEnvelopePublish` to **true.** You can also enable the configuration in the UI.\n* To check if events are being emitted, set `enableLog` to **true** to view event logs in the Connect console.\n\n## Related topics\n\n* For more information about Connect, see the [DocuSign Connect guide](/platform/webhooks/connect/).\n* Use the MyAPICalls sample app to see an [example of this endpoint](https://myapicalls.sampleapps.docusign.com/scenario/6) using the JSON SIM model.",

Since an envelope that has been delivered can\nnever have a status of `created` or `sent`, a zero-size\nresponse would be generated.\nIn this case, DocuSign does not query the database\nand returns an empty list immediately.\n\nGetting envelope status using `transaction_ids` is useful\nfor offline signing situations where it can be used\ndetermine if an envelope was created or not. It can be used\nfor the cases where a network connection was lost, before\nthe envelope status could be returned.\n\n\nThe following table shows the valid current envelope\nstatuses (`status` parameter) for the different status\nqualifiers (`from_to_status` parameter) in the request. If\nthe status and status qualifiers in the API request do not\ncontain any of the values shown in the Valid Current\nStatuses column, then an empty list is returned.\n\nClient applications should check that the statuses (`status`\nparameter) they are requesting make sense for a given\n`from_to_status` parameter value.\n\n| Status Qualifier<br>(`from_to_status`) | Effective Status Qualifier | Valid Current Statuses                                                      |\n| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| any (changed)                          | StatusChanged              | any, created, sent, delivered, signed, completed, declined, voided, deleted |\n| created                                | Created                    | any, created, sent, delivered, signed, completed, declined, voided, deleted |\n| sent                                   | Sent                       | any, sent, delivered, signed, completed, declined, voided, deleted          |\n| delivered                              | StatusChanged              | any, delivered, signed, completed, declined, voided, deleted                |\n| signed                                 | StatusChanged              | any, signed, completed, declined, voided, deleted                           |\n| completed                              | Completed                  | any, completed, declined, voided, deleted                                   |\n| declined                               | StatusChanged              | any, declined, voided, deleted                                              |\n| timedout<br>always return zero results | StatusChanged              | any, voided, deleted                                                        |\n| voided                                 | Voided                     | any, voided, deleted                                                        |\n| deleted                                | StatusChanged              | any, deleted                                                                |\n\n## Extraneous results\n\nIn some cases, a request for a specific envelope status will\ninclude envelopes with additional statuses. For example, in\na request with a `from_date` of 2017-01-01, a `to_date` of\n2017-01-07 and the status qualifier (`from_to_status`) set\nto `delivered`, the response set might contain envelopes\nthat were created during that time period, but not delivered\nduring the time period. As a workaround, check the envelope\nstatus values in the result set as needed.\n\n\n### Related topics\n\n- [Searching for envelopes](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/envelopes/search/)\n- [How to list envelope status changes](/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/list-envelope-status-changes/)\n",

It will be checked against the signer's government-issued proof of identity by the notary public.\n\nPlease see the [DocuSign eNotary resource page](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/ndse-user-guide-enotary-resources) for further information.

This enables a single envelope to include:\n\n* electronic signatures,\n* AES digital signatures using certificates from DocuSign or from your organization,\n* QES digital signatures from government certified Trust Service Providers (TSPs).\n\nThis example enables the signer to create an eIDAS compliant AES signature with embedded signing. InPerson signers can also use SBS digital signatures.\n\n[More information on creating SBS digital signature requests.](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/standards-based-signatures/)\n\nThe `clientId` in the example tells DocuSign that the Signing Ceremony will be embedded.\nThe example also includes an `eventNotification` object for receiving envelope status updates from DocuSign.\n\n## Embedding the signing ceremony\n1. Send the `Envelopes: create` call as shown below in the Request/Response section.\n2. The response will include the `envelopeId`\n3. Use the [EnvelopeViews: createRecipient](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopeviews/createrecipient/) request to obtain the redirectURL as follows:\n\n`POST /v2.1/accounts/{accountId}/envelopes/{envelopeId}/views/recipient`\n\n````\n{\n    \"clientUserId\": \"1000\",\n    \"email\": \"Sam@spade.com\",\n    \"userName\": \"Sam Spade\",\n    \"returnUrl\": \"https://your_app.example.com\",\n    \"AuthenticationMethod\": \"Password\"\n}\n````\nThe response will include the `url`. Redirect the user's browser to the URL to start the signing ceremony.\n\n**Note:** You must **immediately** redirect the user to the URL you receive from DocuSign. The URL is only valid for 5 minutes. Don't request a recipient view URL until you are ready to redirect the user's browser.\n",

To customize the appearance of the correction view, you can add special query parameters to the returned URL when you use it in your application.\n\nYou can revoke this URL by calling the [deleteEnvelopeCorrectView](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopeviews/deleteenvelopecorrectview/) endpoint.\n\n## Best practices\n\nThe returned URL expires after 10 minutes and can only be used once. Therefore, request the URL immediately before you redirect your user to it.\n\nDue to screen space issues, do not use an `<iframe>` for embedded operations on mobile devices. For iOS devices, DocuSign recommends using a WebView.\n\n## Customizing the correction view\n\nTo customize the appearance of the correction view, you can add query parameters **to the URL that is returned by this endpoint and used in your application.** Do not add these query parameters to the URL of the endpoint itself.\n\nFor example, adding the following query parameters to the URL returned by this method causes the sending view to:\n\n- start in the tagging screen\n- hide the Edit Pages command\n- hide all of the options under the Actions dropdown except Save, Close, and Discard\n\n```\nhttps://demo.docusign.net/Member/StartInSession.aspx?StartConsole=1&t=dd3b7c4c-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-50cd195a3401&DocuEnvelope=f37489d3-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-4de057063d0e&\\\n        advcorrect=1&\\\n        showEditPages=false&\\\n        showHeaderActions=false\n```\n\n\nThe default value reflects what happens\nif you omit the customization query parameter.\nYou can use the interactive\n[Embedded Sending Demo tool](https://dsdemos.esigndemos.com/embeddedsending/v3/embeddedsending.aspx)\nto see the effect of using different query parameters.\n\n\n\n| Query Parameter             | Default Value                                                                                                    | Alternate Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| sendButtonAction            | `send`<br><br>The Send button operates normally.                                                                 | `redirect`<br><br>The text of the button changes to Continue.

        "description": "Returns a URL that enables you to\n[embed the recipient view](/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/embedding/)\nof the\nDocuSign UI in your applications. If the recipient is a signer,\nthen the view will provide the signing ceremony.\n\nThis method is only used with envelopes in the `sent` status.\n\nDue to screen space issues,\ndo not use an `<iframe>` for embedded operations on mobile devices.\nFor iOS devices, DocuSign recommends using a WebView.\n\n### Revoking the URL\n\nYou can revoke this URL by making\na DELETE HTTP request to the URL\nwith no request body.\n\n\n## Authentication\n\nYour application is responsible for authenticating the identity\nof the recipient or signer when you use this method. Use the\nfollowing parameters to record how the recipient\nwas authenticated.\n\n- `assertionId`\n- `authenticationInstant`\n- `authenticationMethod`\n- `clientUserId`\n- `securityDomain`\n\nAt a minimum, `authenticationMethod` and `clientUserId` are\nrequired. The information that you provide is included in the\nenvelope's certificate of completion.\n\n## Redirects\nAfter the signer completes or ends the signing ceremony, DocuSign\nredirects the user's browser back to your app via the\n`returnUrl` that you supply.\n\n**Note:** The user may be redirected through various DocuSign\nsubdomains, depending on the region of the account sending the\nenvelope. Please consult the **Allowlists for DocuSign eSignature service**\nsection in [Security for DocuSign eSignature](https://www.docusign.com/trust/security/esignature)\nwhen setting up your allowlists.\n\n### The event status parameter\nDocuSign appends an `event` query parameter to the `returnUrl` with the\noutcome of the signing ceremony. Your app can use this event\nparameter to determine the next step for the envelope.\nDo not fetch the envelope status by using\n[Envelopes: get](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopes/get/)\nor a similar method because doing so could break\nthe DocuSign rule against polling.\n\n**Note:** Because a user can cancel redirection, close their\nbrowser after signing, or spoof the landing URL, the\n`returnUrl` should not be the single source of truth for envelope\nstatus for your integration.\n\n## The URL is time-limited\n\nThe URL returned in this method's response is valid for one use,\nand you must use or display it within a couple of minutes after\nit is generated. After the recipient is redirected to the\nrecipient view, they must interact with the DocuSign system\nperiodically or their session will time out.\n\nBecause the URL is time-limited, it should not be stored or sent\nthrough email. After you receive it, immediately redirect the\nuser's browser to the URL.\n\nIf you want to invite someone to an embedded signing session via\nemail, the email invitation's URL must be to your application.\nWhen invoked, your app should request a `recipientView` URL from\nDocuSign and then redirect the signer to that URL.\n\n## Maintaining State\nAfter the recipient completes the recipient view (or signing\nceremony), they are redirected to your application. Your\napplication can recover state information about the transaction\nby storing information in a cookie, or by including query\nparameters in the `returnUrl` field. For example.\n`https://myapp.example.com/docusign_return?myState=12345` When the\nuser is redirected to your app, the `event` query parameter will\nbe appended. In this example, prevent spoofing by not using a\nguessable value as the state value.\n\n\n## How to specify the default language\n\nThe language for the recipient view\nfollows this order or precedence:\n\n- The language specified by the sender for the recipient.\n- The `locale` parameter appended to the URL.\n- The account language if the signer has a DocuSign account.\n- The language used in a previous signing if the signer is return signer.\n- The browser language.\n\nYou can append the `locale`\nquery parameter\nto the URL returned by this method\nto specify a language.\nFor example, to set the default language\nto Canadian French, you would set\nit like this:\n\n```\n...?locale=fr_CA\n```\n\n## Sending to a remote signer\n\nYou can request a signing session for a remote recipient\nwho has a DocuSign account.\n\nAuthenticate the request using the recipient's\ncredentials, and do not specify a  `clientUserId`.\nThis differs from the typical behavior where the\nrequest is authenticated using the sender's credentials,\nand the recipient has a `clientUserId` defined.\n\n\n\n\n### Related topics\n\n- [How to request a signature by email](/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/request-signature-email-remote/)\n- [How to request a signature through your app](/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/request-signature-in-app-embedded/)\n- [How to request a signature using a composite template](/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/request-signature-composite-template-embedded/)\n- [How to send an envelope via your app](/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/embedded-sending/)\n- [How to set envelope tab values](/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/set-envelope-tab-values/)\n- [How to set tab values in a template](/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/set-template-tab-values/)\n\n",

It can only be used once. Therefore, request the\nURL immediately before you redirect your user to it.\n\nDue to screen space issues,\ndo not use an `<iframe>` for embedded operations on mobile devices.\nFor iOS devices, DocuSign recommends using a WebView.\n\nAfter the user has completed the sending view, the browser is\nredirected to the `returnUrl` supplied.\n\nBy default, if the envelope already contains one or more\ndocuments, DocuSign will initially show the document tagging view\nwhen you redirect to the URL.\n\nTo start with the envelope's recipients and documents view\ninstead, examine the URL in the method's response. Then change\nthe query parameter from `send=1` to `send=0` to start with the\nrecipients/documents view.\n\n### Revoking the URL\n\nYou can revoke this URL by making\na DELETE HTTP request to the URL\nwith no request body.\n\n\n\n## Customizing the sending view\n\nYou can add query parameters\nto customize the appearance of the sending view.\nFor example, adding the following query parameters\nto the URL returned by this method\ncauses the sending view to:\n\n- start in the tagging screen\n- hide the Edit Pages command\n- hide all of the options under the Actions dropdown except Save, Close, and Discard\n\n```\nhttps://demo.docusign.net/Member/StartInSession.aspx?StartConsole=1&t=dd3b7c4c-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-50cd195a3401&DocuEnvelope=f37489d3-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-4de057063d0e&\\\n        send=1&\\\n        showEditPages=false&\\\n        showHeaderActions=false\n```\n\n\nThe default value reflects what happens\nif you omit the customization query parameter.\nYou can use the interactive\n[Embedded Sending Demo tool](https://dsdemos.esigndemos.com/embeddedsending/v3/embeddedsending.aspx)\nto see the effect of using different query parameters.\n\n| Query Parameter             | Default Value                                                                                                    | Alternate Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| sendButtonAction            | `send`<br><br>The Send button operates normally.                                                                 | `redirect`<br><br>The text of the button changes to Continue.

However, PDF PowerForms are deprecated and are not supported in the API.\n\n**Note:** A PowerForm can have only one sender. (Because PowerForms are not necessarily sent by email, this user is also referred to as the PowerForm *initiator*.) If you need to associate multiple senders with a PowerForm, create multiple copies of the PowerForm by using the same template (one copy for each sender). By default, the sender is the PowerForm Administrator who creates the PowerForm.\n\n\n### Signing modes\n\nYou can use one of the following signing modes for a PowerForm:\n\n**`email`**\n\nThis mode verifies the recipient's identity by using email authentication before the recipient can sign a document. The recipient enters their email address on the landing page and then clicks **Begin Signing** to begin the signing process. The system then sends an email message with a validation code to the recipient. If the recipient does not provide a valid email address, they do not receive the email message containing the access code and are not able to open and sign the document.\n\nAlternatively, you can make the process easier for signers by using email authentication only and omitting the access code. To do this, you append the `activateonly` flag to the PowerForm URL and set it to true by passing in the value `1`.  When the flag is active, the first recipient receives an email with a link that initiates the signing session without having to enter access code.\n\nExample: `activateonly=1`\n\n**`direct`**\n\nThis mode does not require any verification. After a recipient enters their email address on the landing page and clicks **Begin Signing,** a new browser tab opens and the recipient can immediately begin the signing process.\n\nBecause the `direct` signing mode does not verify the recipient's identity by using email authentication, we strongly recommend that you use this mode only when the PowerForm is accessible behind a secure portal where the recipient's identity is already authenticated, or where another form of authentication is specified for the recipient in the DocuSign template (for example, an access code, phone authentication, or ID check).\n\n**Note:** In the account settings, `enablePowerFormDirect` must be **true** to use `direct` as the `signingMode`.\n\n### Redirect URLs\n\nYou can control the URL to which signers are redirected after signing your PowerForm. However, the URL is specified elsewhere, outside of the PowerForm creation process. For details, see [How do I specify a URL to redirect to when a PowerForm is completed?](https://support.docusign.com/en/articles/How-do-I-specify-a-URL-to-redirect-to-when-a-Powerform-is-completed).\n\n### More information\n\nFor more information about creating PowerForms, see [Create a PowerForm](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/ndse-user-guide-create-a-powerform).\n\n",

Rather\nthan specifying a person, you specify a role that regularly\nparticipates in a transaction that uses the template. Then, when\nyou create or send an envelope based on the template, you assign\nactual recipients to the template roles. The recipients\nautomatically inherit all of the workflow that is defined for\nthat role in the template, such as the tabs and routing\ninformation.\n\n## Template Email Subject Merge Fields\n\nPlaceholder roles have associated merge fields that personalize\nthe email notification that DocuSign sends. For example, the\ntemplate automatically personalizes the email message by adding\nplaceholders for the recipient's name and email address within\nthe email subject line, based on the recipient's role. When the\nsender adds the name and email information for the recipient and\nsends the envelope, the recipient information is automatically\nmerged into the appropriate fields in the email subject line.\n\nBoth the sender and the recipients will see the information in\nthe email subject line for any emails associated with the\ntemplate. This provides an easy way for senders to organize their\nenvelope emails without having to open an envelope to find out\nwho the recipient is.\n\n\n\nUse the following placeholders\nto insert a recipient's name or\nemail address in the subject line\n\nTo insert a recipient's name into the subject line,\nuse the `[[<roleName>_UserName]]` placholder\nin the  `emailSubject` property when you create the\ntemplate:\n\nTo include a recipient's name\nor email address in the subject line,\nuse the following placeholders\nin the `emailSubject` property:\n\n- `[[<roleName>_UserName]]`\n- `[[<roleName>_Email]]`\n\n\nFor example, if the role name is `Signer 1`,\nyou might set `emailSubject` to one of these strings:\n\n- `\"[[Signer 1_UserName]], Please sign this NDA\"`\n- `\"[[Signer 1_Email]], Please sign this NDA\"`\n\n\n**Note:** The maximum length of the\nsubject line is 100 characters,\nincluding any merged text.\n\n\n## Creating multiple templates\n\nTo create multiple templates, you provide a zip file of JSON\nfiles. You can also use the Templates::ListTemplates method with\nthe `is_download` query parameter to download a zip file\ncontaining your existing templates and use that as a guide. The\nAPI supports both .zip and .gzip file formats as input.\n\nYou also need to set the\n`Content-Length`,\n`Content-Type`,\nand\n`Content-Disposition`\nheaders:\n\n\n```\nContent-Length: 71068\nContent-Type: application/zip\nContent-Disposition: file; filename=\"DocuSignTemplates_Nov_25_2019_20_40_21.zip\"; fileExtension=.zip\n```\n\n### Related topics\n\n- [How to create a template](/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/create-template/)\n",

When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\nWhen `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. \n\n*Example*: \n\n`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]` ",

When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.\n\nThis functionality uses the following rules:\n\n- Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:\n\n  $~><|^+=\n\n  For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`\n\n- Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.\n\n- In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**\n\n- Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.\n\n- For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.\n\n- Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).\n\n\n**Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.\n\n[AnchorTab]: /docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/tabs/auto-place/\n",

When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\nWhen `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. \n\n*Example*: \n\n`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]` ",

When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\nWhen `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. \n\n*Example*: \n\n`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]` ",

When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\nWhen `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope.

When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.\n\nThis functionality uses the following rules:\n\n- Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:\n\n  $~><|^+=\n\n  For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`\n\n- Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.\n\n- In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**\n\n- Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.\n\n- For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.\n\n- Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).\n\n**Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.\n\n[AnchorTabs]: /docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/tabs/auto-place/",

The default value is **false.**\n\nFor example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.\n\nThis functionality uses the following rules:\n\n- Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:\n\n  $~><|^+=\n\n  For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`\n\n- Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.\n\n- In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**\n\n- Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.\n\n- For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.\n\n- Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).\n\n\n**Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.\n\n[AnchorTab]: /docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/tabs/auto-place/\n",

When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.\n\nThis functionality uses the following rules:\n\n- Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:\n\n  $~><|^+=\n\n  For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`\n\n- Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.\n\n- In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**\n\n- Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.\n\n- For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.\n\n- Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).\n\n**Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.\n\n[AnchorTabs]: /docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/tabs/auto-place/",

When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\nWhen `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. \n\n*Example*: \n\n`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]` ",

When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.\n\nThis functionality uses the following rules:\n\n- Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:\n\n  $~><|^+=\n\n  For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`\n\n- Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.\n\n- In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**\n\n- Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.\n\n- For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.\n\n- Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).\n\n\n**Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.\n\n[AnchorTab]: /docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/tabs/auto-place/\n",

When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\nWhen `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. \n\n*Example*: \n\n`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]` ",

When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\nWhen `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. \n\n*Example*: \n\n`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]` ",

When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\nWhen `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. \n\n*Example*: \n\n`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]` ",

When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\nWhen `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. \n\n*Example*: \n\n`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]` ",

When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\nWhen `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. \n\n*Example*: \n\n`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]` ",

When **false,** `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.\n\nThis functionality uses the following rules:\n\n- Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:\n\n  $~><|^+=\n\n  For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`\n\n- Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.\n\n- In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**\n\n- Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.\n\n- For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.\n\n- Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).\n\n**Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.\n\n[AnchorTabs]: /docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/tabs/auto-place/",

            "description": "Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\nWhen `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. \n\n*Example*: \n\n`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]` ",

When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.\n\nThis functionality uses the following rules:\n\n- Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:\n\n  $~><|^+=\n\n  For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`\n\n- Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.\n\n- In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**\n\n- Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.\n\n- For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.\n\n- Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).\n\n\n**Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.\n\n[AnchorTab]: /docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/tabs/auto-place/\n",

When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\nWhen `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use.

Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope.

When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.\n\nThis functionality uses the following rules:\n\n- Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:\n\n  $~><|^+=\n\n  For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`\n\n- Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.\n\n- In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**\n\n- Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.\n\n- For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.\n\n- Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.\n\n  Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).\n\n\n**Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.\n\n[AnchorTab]: /docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/tabs/auto-place/\n",

When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\nWhen `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets. \n\n*Example*: \n\n`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]` ",

Then, when an interesting event\noccurs, the DocuSign platform will contact your application with\nthe event's details and data. You can register interest in\nenvelopes sent by particular users in your account, or for\nenvelopes sent by any user.\n\nConnect can empower your organization to manage document actions\nas they occur, and allows you to track their changes within your\nown systems. Upon completion, envelope information, including\ndocument content, can be stored in your own databases or CMS\nsystems, and these events can be triggered via webhooks\ndelivering messages to your application.\n\n**Note:** To make API calls to any of the Connect endpoints, you must be an account administrator.\n\n## Incoming Connect Calls\n\nTo use the Connect service, your application needs to provide an\nHTTPS URL that can be called from the public Internet. If your\napplication runs on a server behind your organization's firewall,\nthen you will need to create a \"pinhole\" in the firewall to allow\nthe incoming Connect calls from DocuSign to reach your\napplication. You can also use other techniques such as proxy\nservers and DMZ networking for receiving the incoming calls.\n\nConnect delivers events over HTTP requests in JSON or XML.\nSee [DocuSign Connect overview](/platform/webhooks/connect/).\n\nIf your application is not configured to accept post messages,\nDocuSign will NOT return an additional post error response to\nyour listener application. If you've enabled logging on your\nconfiguration, it will be logged in Admin under the configuration\nfailure log.\n\n## Per-envelope Connect Configuration\n\nInstead of registering a general Connect configuration and\nlistener, an individual envelope can have its own Connect\nconfiguration. See the\n[`eventNotification`](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopes/create/#schema__envelopedefinition_eventnotification)\nproperty for envelopes.\n\n## Historical Publish Endpoint\n\nTo submit existing envelopes to an endpoint, use the [EnvelopePublish](/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopepublish/) resource.\n",
