      An `Account` represents an individual customer account, organization
      or partner involved with the IXP. They are used to consume
      services from an IXP.

      Accounts can have a hierarchy, i.e. an
      account can have sub-accounts. The max-depth of
      the account-hierarchy may vary by implementer, but it's safe to
      assume an account can have sub-accounts.

      Each `Account` has a state. Only `Account`s in state `production`
      or `production_state_pending` are ready to consume services.

      There are `Contact`s associated with each account. Contacts can
      be assigned for `Role`s via `RoleAssignment`s. Depending on the
      IXP and the services the account wants to use, contacts with
      specific roles may be required.
      A contact with role `legal` is mandatory for an account to become
      operational.

      Only accounts with `billing_information` present can be used
      as a `billing_account`.

      Open an authorized session with the IX-API. This is equivalent to
      a 'login' endpoint.

      Upon success, you will receive an `access_token` and
      a `refreh_token`. Both are JWTs and have limited lifetimes. You
      can get information like their expiry time directly by parsing
      the tokens.

      Use the `access_token` as `Bearer` in your `Authorization` header
      for getting access to the API.

      When the session (i.e. the `access_token`) expires, use the
      `refresh_token` (if it's not yet expired) with the
      `refresh`-endpoint to reauthenticate and get a fresh `access_token`.

  - description: |-
      A `Connection` is a functional group of physical connections
      collected together into a LAG (aka trunk).

      A `connection` with only one `port` can be also configured as
      standalone which means no LAG configuration on the switch.
    name: connections
  - description: |-
      A `Contact` is a role undertaking a specific responsibility
      within an account, typically a department or agent of the
      customer company.

      `Contact`s are assigned multiple roles by `RoleAssignment`s.

      A contact is bound to the account by the `consuming_account` property.

      A `Device` is a network hardware device, typically a switch, which
      is located at a specified facility and inside a `PointOfPresence`.

      An `IP` is a IPv4 or 6 addresses, with a given validity period.
      Some services require IP addresses to work.

      When you are joining an `exchange_lan` network service
      for example, addresses on the peering lan will be assigned
      to you.
    name: ips
  - description: |-
      A `MAC` is a MAC addresses with a given validity period.

      Some services require MAC addresses to work.
      Please note that only *unicast* MAC addresses are allowed.
      You are not alllowed to use multicast or broadcast addresses.

      The address itself can not be updated after creation.
      However: It can be expired by changing the `valid_not_before`
      and `valid_not_after` properties.

      A `MemberJoiningRule` defines a rule to allow or deny access for
      an `Account` to a access a `NetworkService`.

      Furthermore, some `NetworkService`s may only be visible if the
      querying account is listed in an allow rule.

      Services are provided directly on or can be consumed
      from inside a `MetroAreaNetwork`.

      Accounts can indicate their presence in a `MetroAreaNetwork`
      to others by adding a list of ids.

      A `NetworkFeatureConfig` is a configuration for
      using a `NetworkFeature`.

      For certain `NetworkFeature`s, which are marked as required,
      one `NetworkFeatureConfig needs to be created in order to move
      the `NetworkServiceConfig` into `production`.

      A `NetworkServiceConfig` is a customer's configuration for usage
      of a `NetworkService`, e.g. the configuration of a (subset of a)
      connection for that customer's traffic

      The `type` of the config determines the service you are
      configuring.

      You can find the services available to you on the platform,
      by querying the `NetworkService`s resource.

      For certain `NetworkFeature`s, which are marked as required,
      one `NetworkFeatureConfig needs to be created in order to move
      the  `NetworkServiceConfig` into `production`.

      A `NetworkService` represents an instance of a `ProductOffering`.

      The exchange lan is a special case in which the `NetworkService` is
      managed by the exchange.

      All other `NetworkService`s are created and managed by an `Account`.

      A `PointOfPresence` is a technical installation within a Facility

        Update parts of an ip address.


        As with the `PUT` opertaion, IP addresses, where you
        don't have update rights, will yield a `resource access denied`
        error when attempting an update.

        If the ip address was allocated for you, you might
        not be able to change anything but the `fqdn`.

        The cancellation-policy can be queried to answer
        the questions:

        If I cancel my subscription, *when will it be technically
        decommissioned*?
        If I cancel my subscription, *until what date will I be charged*?

        When the query parameter `decommision_at` is not provided
        it will provide the first possible cancellation date
        and charge period if cancelled at above date.

        The granularity of the date field is a day, the start and end
        of which are to be interpreted by the IXP (some may use UTC,
        some may use their local time zone).

        Request decomissioning of the network service.

        The network service will enter the state of
        `decommission_requested`. The request will
        cascade to related network service and feature
        configs.

        An *optional request body* can be provided to request
        a specific service termination date.

        If no date is given in the request body, it is assumed to
        be the earliest possible date.

        Possible values for `decommission_at` can be queried
        through the `network_service_cancellation_policy_read`
        operation.

        The response will contain the dates on which the
        changes will be effected.

        The cancellation-policy can be queried to answer
        the questions:

        If I cancel my service, *when will it be technically

        If I cancel my service, *until what date will I be charged*?

        When the query parameter `decommision_at` is not provided

        Request a change to the network service.

        A participant in a network service of type
        `p2p_vc` can issue a change request, expressing a
        desired change in the capacity.
        The change is accepted when all sides have configured
        the network service configs with the new bandwidth.
        These changes can sometimes require a change of the
        product offering.
        The product offering may only differ in regards to
        bandwidth.

        The network service will change it's state from `production`
        into `production_change_pending`.

        Only one change request may be issued at a time.
