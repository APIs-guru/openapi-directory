    # Summary
    The **Swiss NextGen API** is based on the NextGenPSD2 *Framework Version 1.3.4* of the Berlin Group which offers a modern, open, harmonised and interoperable set of
    Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) as the safest and most efficient way to provide data securely.
    The NextGen Framework reduces XS2A complexity and costs, addresses the problem of multiple competing standards
    in Europe and, aligned with the goals of the Euro Retail Payments Board,
    enables European banking customers to benefit from innovative products and services ('Banking as a Service')
    by granting TPPs safe and secure (authenticated and authorised) access to their bank accounts and financial data.

    The Swiss edtion refines the message formats specific to Switzerland and defines some matching examples.

    The possible Approaches are:
      * Redirect SCA Approach
      * *(Not recommended by obp.ch community) OAuth SCA Approach*
      * *(Not recommended by obp.ch community) Decoupled SCA Approach*
      * *(Not recommended by obp.ch community) Embedded SCA Approach without SCA method*
      * *(Not recommended by obp.ch community) Embedded SCA Approach with only one SCA method available*
      * *(Not recommended by obp.ch community) Embedded SCA Approach with Selection of a SCA method*

      Not every message defined in this API definition is necessary for all approaches.
      Furthermore this API definition does not differ between methods which are mandatory, conditional, or optional
      Therefore for a particular implementation of a compliant API it is only necessary to support
      a certain subset of the methods defined in this API definition.

      **Please have a look at the implementation guidelines if you are not sure
      which message has to be used for the approach you are going to use.**

    ## Some General Remarks Related to this version of the OpenAPI Specification:
    * **This API definition is based on the Implementation Guidelines of the [Berlin Group API](https://www.berlin-group.org/nextgenpsd2-downloads).**
      It is not a replacement in any sense.
      The main specification is (at the moment) always the Implementation Guidelines of the Berlin Group API.
    * **This API definition contains the REST-API for requests from the PISP to the ASPSP.**
    * **This API definition contains the messages for all different approaches defined in the Implementation Guidelines.**
    * According to the OpenAPI-Specification [https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md]

        "If in is "header" and the name field is "Accept", "Content-Type" or "Authorization", the parameter definition SHALL be ignored."

      The element "Accept" will not be defined in this file at any place.

      The elements "Content-Type" and "Authorization" are implicitly defined by the OpenApi tags "content" and "security".

    * There are several predefined types which might occur in payment initiation messages,
      but are not used in the standard JSON messages in the Implementation Guidelines.
      Therefore they are not used in the corresponding messages in this file either.
      We added them for the convenience of the user.
      If there is a payment product, which needs these fields, one can easily use the predefined types.
      But the ASPSP need not to accept them in general.

    * **We omit the definition of all standard HTTP header elements (mandatory/optional/conditional)
      except they are mentioned in the Implementation Guidelines.**
      Therefore the implementer might add these in his own realisation of a comlient API in addition to the elements defined in this file.

    ## General Remarks on Data Types

    The Berlin Group definition of UTF-8 strings in context of the API have to support at least the following characters

    a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z

    A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

      The component for Payment Initiation Service (PIS) offers the following services:
        * Initiation and update of a payment request
        * Status information of a payment
    name: Payment Initiation Service (PIS)

      Confirmation of Funds Service (PIIS) returns a confirmation of funds request at the ASPSP.
    name: Confirmation of Funds Service (PIIS)

      The Account Information Service (AIS) offers the following services:
        * Transaction reports for a given account or card account including balances if applicable
        * Balances of a given account or card account
        * A list of available accounts or card account
        * Account details of a given account or card account or of the list of all accessible accounts or card account  relative to a granted consent
    name: Account Information Service (AIS)

      Signing basket methods are used for authorising several transactions and resp. or consents with one SCA operation.
    name: Signing Baskets Service (SBS)
  - description: |
      Processes on starting authorisations, update PSU identification or PSU authentication data and explicit 
      authorisation of transactions by using SCA are very similar in PIS and AIS and signing baskets services. 
      The API calls supporting these processes are described in the following independently from the service/endpoint. 
      For reasons of clarity, the endpoints are defined always for the Payment Initiation Service, the payment cancellation, 
      the Account Information Service (Consents), and Signing Baskets separately. 
      These processes usually are used following a hyperlink of the ASPSP.

      description: |
        Read the identifiers of the available payment account together with 
        booking balance information, depending on the consent granted.

        It is assumed that a consent of the PSU to this access is already given and stored on the ASPSP system.
        The addressed list of accounts depends then on the PSU ID and the stored consent addressed by consentId,
        respectively the OAuth2 access token.

        Returns all identifiers of the accounts, to which an account access has been granted to through
        the /consents endpoint by the PSU.
        In addition, relevant information about the accounts and hyperlinks to corresponding account
        information resources are provided if a related consent has been already granted.

        Remark: Note that the /consents endpoint optionally offers to grant an access on all available
        payment accounts of a PSU.
        In this case, this endpoint will deliver the information about all available payment accounts
        of the PSU at this ASPSP.

        This method create a consent resource, defining access rights to dedicated accounts of 
        a given PSU-ID. These accounts are addressed explicitly in the method as 
        parameters as a core function.

        **Side Effects**
        When this consent request is a request where the "recurringIndicator" equals "true",
        and if it exists already a former consent for recurring access on account information 
        for the addressed PSU, then the former consent automatically expires as soon as the new 
        consent request is authorised by the PSU.

        Optional Extension:
        As an option, an ASPSP might optionally accept a specific access right on the access on all PSD2 related services for all available accounts.

        As another option an ASPSP might optionally also accept a command, where only access rights are inserted without mentioning the addressed account. 
        The relation to accounts is then handled afterwards between PSU and ASPSP. 
        This option is not supported for the Embedded SCA Approach. 
        As a last option, an ASPSP might in addition accept a command with access rights
          * to see the list of available payment accounts or
          * to see the list of available payment accounts with balances.

        Create an authorisation sub-resource and start the authorisation process of a consent.
        The message might in addition transmit authentication and authorisation related data.

        his method is iterated n times for a n times SCA authorisation in a
        corporate context, each creating an own authorisation sub-endpoint for
        the corresponding PSU authorising the consent.

        The ASPSP might make the usage of this access method unnecessary,
        since the related authorisation resource will be automatically created by
        the ASPSP after the submission of the consent data with the first POST consents call.

        The start authorisation process is a process which is needed for creating a new authorisation
        or cancellation sub-resource.

        This applies in the following scenarios:

          * The ASPSP has indicated with an 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink in the preceding Payment 
            initiation response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP. 
            The 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be 
            uploaded by using the extended forms:
            * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuIdentfication', 
            * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuAuthentication' 
            * 'startAuthorisationWithEncryptedPsuAuthentication'
            * 'startAuthorisationWithAuthentciationMethodSelection'
          * The related payment initiation cannot yet be executed since a multilevel SCA is mandated.
          * The ASPSP has indicated with an 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink in the preceding 
            payment cancellation response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP. 
            The 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be uploaded 
            by using the extended forms as indicated above.
          * The related payment cancellation request cannot be applied yet since a multilevel SCA is mandate for
            executing the cancellation.
          * The signing basket needs to be authorised yet.

        This method update PSU data on the consents  resource if needed.
        It may authorise a consent within the Embedded SCA Approach where needed.

        Independently from the SCA Approach it supports e.g. the selection of
        the authentication method and a non-SCA PSU authentication.

        There are several possible update PSU data requests in the context of a consent request if needed, 
        which depends on the SCA approach:

        * Redirect SCA Approach:
          A specific Update PSU data request is applicable for 
            * the selection of authentication methods, before choosing the actual SCA approach.
        * Decoupled SCA Approach:
          A specific update PSU data request is only applicable for
          * adding the PSU Identification, if not provided yet in the payment initiation request or the Account Information Consent Request, or if no OAuth2 access token is used, or
          * the selection of authentication methods.
        * Embedded SCA Approach: 
          The Update PSU data request might be used 
          * to add credentials as a first factor authentication data of the PSU and
          * to select the authentication method and
          * transaction authorisation.

        The SCA Approach might depend on the chosen SCA method. 
        For that reason, the following possible update PSU data request can apply to all SCA approaches:

        * Select an SCA method in case of several SCA methods are available for the customer.

        There are the following request types on this access path:
          * Update PSU identification
          * Update PSU authentication
          * Select PSU autorization method 
            WARNING: This method needs a reduced header, 
            therefore many optional elements are not present. 
            Maybe in a later version the access path will change.
          * Transaction Authorisation
            WARNING: This method needs a reduced header, 
            therefore many optional elements are not present. 
            Maybe in a later version the access path will change.

      summary: Get signing basket authorisation sub-resources request

        Create an authorisation sub-resource and start the authorisation process of a signing basket.
        The message might in addition transmit authentication and authorisation related data.

        This method is iterated n times for a n times SCA authorisation in a
        corporate context, each creating an own authorisation sub-endpoint for
        the corresponding PSU authorising the signing-baskets.

        The ASPSP might make the usage of this access method unnecessary in case
        of only one SCA process needed, since the related authorisation resource
        might be automatically created by the ASPSP after the submission of the
        payment data with the first POST signing basket call.

        The start authorisation process is a process which is needed for creating a new authorisation
        or cancellation sub-resource.

        This applies in the following scenarios:

          * The ASPSP has indicated with a 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink in the preceding payment 
            initiation response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP. 
            The 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be 
            uploaded by using the extended forms:
            * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuIdentfication', 
            * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuAuthentication' 
            * 'startAuthorisationWithEncryptedPsuAuthentication'
            * 'startAuthorisationWithAuthentciationMethodSelection'
          * The related payment initiation cannot yet be executed since a multilevel SCA is mandated.
          * The ASPSP has indicated with a 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink in the preceding 
            payment cancellation response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP.
            The 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be uploaded
            by using the extended forms as indicated above.
          * The related payment cancellation request cannot be applied yet since a multilevel SCA is mandate for
            executing the cancellation.
          * The signing basket needs to be authorised yet.

        This method update PSU data on the signing basket resource if needed. 
        It may authorise a igning basket within the embedded SCA approach where needed.

        Independently from the SCA Approach it supports e.g. the selection of 
        the authentication method and a non-SCA PSU authentication.

        There are several possible update PSU data requests in the context of a consent request if needed, 
        which depends on the SCA approach:

        * Redirect SCA Approach:
          A specific Update PSU data request is applicable for 
            * the selection of authentication methods, before choosing the actual SCA approach.
        * Decoupled SCA Approach:
          A specific Update PSU data request is only applicable for
          * adding the PSU Identification, if not provided yet in the payment initiation request or the account information consent request, or if no OAuth2 access token is used, or
          * the selection of authentication methods.
        * Embedded SCA Approach: 
          The update PSU data request might be used 
          * to add credentials as a first factor authentication data of the PSU and
          * to select the authentication method and
          * transaction authorisation.

        The SCA approach might depend on the chosen SCA method. 
        For that reason, the following possible update PSU data request can apply to all SCA approaches:

        * Select an SCA method in case of several SCA methods are available for the customer.

        There are the following request types on this access path:
          * Update PSU identification
          * Update PSU authentication
          * Select PSU autorization Method 
            WARNING: This method needs a reduced header, 
            therefore many optional elements are not present. 
            Maybe in a later version the access path will change.
          * Transaction Authorisation
            WARNING: This method needs a reduced header, 
            therefore many optional elements are not present. 
            Maybe in a later version the access path will change.

        This method is used to initiate a payment at the ASPSP.

        ## Variants of payment initiation requests

        This method to initiate a payment initiation at the ASPSP can be sent with either a JSON body or an pain.001 body depending on the payment product in the path.

        There are the following **payment products**:

          - Payment products with payment information in *JSON* format:
            - ***domestic-swiss-credit-transfers-isr***
            - ***domestic-swiss-credit-transfers***
            - ***domestic-swiss-credit-transfers-qr***
            - ***domestic-swiss-foreign-credit-transfers***
            - ***swiss-sepa-credit-transfers***
            - ***swiss-cross-border-credit-transfers***
          - Payment products with payment information in *SIX pain.001* XML format:
            - ***pain.001-sepa-credit-transfers***
            - ***pain.001-cross-border-credit-transfers***
            - ***pain.001-swiss-six-credit-transfers***

        Furthermore the request body depends on the **payment-service**:
          * ***payments***: A single payment initiation request.
          * ***bulk-payments***: A collection of several payment initiation requests.
          
            In case of a *pain.001* message there are more than one payments contained in the *pain.001 message.

            In case of a *JSON* there are several JSON payment blocks contained in a joining list.
          * ***periodic-payments***:
            Create a standing order initiation resource for recurrent i.e. periodic payments addressable under {paymentId}
             with all data relevant for the corresponding payment product and the execution of the standing order contained in a JSON body.

        This is the first step in the API to initiate the related recurring/periodic payment.

        ## Single and mulitilevel SCA Processes

        The payment initiation requests are independent from the need of one or multilevel 
        SCA processing, i.e. independent from the number of authorisations needed for the execution of payments. 

        But the response messages are specific to either one SCA processing or multilevel SCA processing. 

        For payment initiation with multilevel SCA, this specification requires an explicit start of the authorisation, 
        i.e. links directly associated with SCA processing like 'scaRedirect' or 'scaOAuth' cannot be contained in the 
        response message of a Payment Initation Request for a payment, where multiple authorisations are needed. 
        Also if any data is needed for the next action, like selecting an SCA method is not supported in the response, 
        since all starts of the multiple authorisations are fully equal. 
        In these cases, first an authorisation sub-resource has to be generated following the 'startAuthorisation' link.

        This method initiates the cancellation of a payment. 
        Depending on the payment-service, the payment-product and the ASPSP's implementation, 
        this TPP call might be sufficient to cancel a payment. 
        If an authorisation of the payment cancellation is mandated by the ASPSP, 
        a corresponding hyperlink will be contained in the response message.

        Cancels the addressed payment with resource identification paymentId if applicable to the payment-service, payment-product and received in product related timelines (e.g. before end of business day for scheduled payments of the last business day before the scheduled execution day). 

        The response to this DELETE command will tell the TPP whether the
          * access method was rejected,
          * access method was successful, or
          * access method is generally applicable, but further authorisation processes are needed.

        Create an authorisation sub-resource and start the authorisation process.
        The message might in addition transmit authentication and authorisation related data.

        This method is iterated n times for a n times SCA authorisation in a
        corporate context, each creating an own authorisation sub-endpoint for
        the corresponding PSU authorising the transaction.

        The ASPSP might make the usage of this access method unnecessary in case
        of only one SCA process needed, since the related authorisation resource
        might be automatically created by the ASPSP after the submission of the
        payment data with the first POST payments/{payment-product} call.

        The start authorisation process is a process which is needed for creating a new authorisation
        or cancellation sub-resource.

        This applies in the following scenarios:

          * The ASPSP has indicated with a 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink in the preceding Payment 
            initiation response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP. 
            The 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be 
            uploaded by using the extended forms:
            * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuIdentfication'
            * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuAuthentication'
            * 'startAuthorisationWithEncryptedPsuAuthentication'
            * 'startAuthorisationWithAuthentciationMethodSelection'
          * The related payment initiation cannot yet be executed since a multilevel SCA is mandated.
          * The ASPSP has indicated with a 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink in the preceding 
            Payment cancellation response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP. 
            The 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be uploaded 
            by using the extended forms as indicated above.
          * The related payment cancellation request cannot be applied yet since a multilevel SCA is mandate for
            executing the cancellation.
          * The signing basket needs to be authorised yet.

        This methods updates PSU data on the authorisation resource if needed.
        It may authorise a payment within the Embedded SCA Approach where needed.

        Independently from the SCA Approach it supports e.g. the selection of
        the authentication method and a non-SCA PSU authentication.

        There are several possible update PSU data requests in the context of payment initiation services needed, 
        which depends on the SCA approach:

        * Redirect SCA Approach:
          A specific update PSU data request is applicable for 
            * the selection of authentication methods, before choosing the actual SCA approach.
        * Decoupled SCA Approach:
          A specific update PSU data request is only applicable for
          * adding the PSU identification, if not provided yet in the payment initiation request or the account information consent request, or if no OAuth2 access token is used, or
          * the selection of authentication methods.
        * Embedded SCA Approach: 
          The Update PSU Data request might be used 
          * to add credentials as a first factor authentication data of the PSU and
          * to select the authentication method and
          * transaction authorisation.

        The SCA Approach might depend on the chosen SCA method. 
        For that reason, the following possible Update PSU data request can apply to all SCA approaches:

        * Select an SCA method in case of several SCA methods are available for the customer.

        There are the following request types on this access path:
          * Update PSU identification
          * Update PSU authentication
          * Select PSU autorization method 
            WARNING: This method needs a reduced header, 
            therefore many optional elements are not present. 
            Maybe in a later version the access path will change.
          * Transaction authorisation

            therefore many optional elements are not present.

        Creates an authorisation sub-resource and start the authorisation process of the cancellation of the addressed payment.
        The message might in addition transmit authentication and authorisation related data.

        This method is iterated n times for a n times SCA authorisation in a
        corporate context, each creating an own authorisation sub-endpoint for
        the corresponding PSU authorising the cancellation-authorisation.

        The ASPSP might make the usage of this access method unnecessary in case
        of only one SCA process needed, since the related authorisation resource
        might be automatically created by the ASPSP after the submission of the
        payment data with the first POST payments/{payment-product} call.

        The start authorisation process is a process which is needed for creating a new authorisation
        or cancellation sub-resource.

        This applies in the following scenarios:

          * The ASPSP has indicated with a 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink in the preceding payment 
            initiation response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP. 
            The 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be 
            uploaded by using the extended forms:
            * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuIdentfication'
            * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuAuthentication'
            * 'startAuthorisationWithAuthentciationMethodSelection' 
          * The related payment initiation cannot yet be executed since a multilevel SCA is mandated.
          * The ASPSP has indicated with a 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink in the preceding 
            payment cancellation response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP. 
            The 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be uploaded 
            by using the extended forms as indicated above.
          * The related payment cancellation request cannot be applied yet since a multilevel SCA is mandate for
            executing the cancellation.
          * The signing basket needs to be authorised yet.

      summary: Read the SCA status of the payment cancellation's authorisation

        This method updates PSU data on the cancellation authorisation resource if needed. 
        It may authorise a cancellation of the payment within the Embedded SCA Approach where needed.

        Independently from the SCA Approach it supports e.g. the selection of
        the authentication method and a non-SCA PSU authentication.

        There are several possible update PSU data requests in the context of a cancellation authorisation within the payment initiation services needed, 
        which depends on the SCA approach:

        * Redirect SCA Approach:
          A specific Update PSU data request is applicable for 
            * the selection of authentication methods, before choosing the actual SCA approach.
        * Decoupled SCA Approach:
          A specific Update PSU data request is only applicable for
          * adding the PSU Identification, if not provided yet in the payment initiation request or the Account Information Consent Request, or if no OAuth2 access token is used, or
          * the selection of authentication methods.
        * Embedded SCA Approach: 
          The Update PSU data request might be used 
          * to add credentials as a first factor authentication data of the PSU and
          * to select the authentication method and
          * transaction authorisation.

        The SCA approach might depend on the chosen SCA method. 
        For that reason, the following possible update PSU data request can apply to all SCA approaches:

        * Select an SCA method in case of several SCA methods are available for the customer.

        There are the following request types on this access path:
          * Update PSU identification
          * Update PSU authentication
          * Select PSU autorization method 
            WARNING: This method needs a reduced header, 
            therefore many optional elements are not present. 
            Maybe in a later version the access path will change.
          * Transaction Authorisation
            WARNING: This method needs a reduced header, 
            therefore many optional elements are not present. 
            Maybe in a later version the access path will change.

        For security reasons, it shall be ensured that the TPP-Notification-URI as introduced above is secured by the TPP eIDAS QWAC used for identification of the TPP. The following applies:

        URIs which are provided by TPPs in TPP-Notification-URI shall comply with the domain secured by the eIDAS QWAC certificate of the TPP in the field CN or SubjectAltName of the certificate. Please note that in case of example-TPP.com as certificate entry TPP- Notification-URI like www.example-TPP.com/xs2a-client/v1/ASPSPidentifcation/mytransaction- id/notifications or notifications.example-TPP.com/xs2a-client/v1/ASPSPidentifcation/mytransaction- id/notifications would be compliant.

        Wildcard definitions shall be taken into account for compliance checks by the ASPSP.
         ASPSPs may respond with ASPSP-Notification-Support set to false, if the provided URIs do not comply.

        SCA approach, depending on the choice of the SCA procedure by the TPP/PSU.
        If the parameter is not used, the ASPSP will choose the SCA approach to be applied depending on the SCA method chosen by the

        providing an integrated confirmation of funds request an the result of this is that not sufficient
        funds are available.

        If it equals "false" then the TPP prefers that the ASPSP is dealing with the payment initiation like
        in the ASPSPs online channel, potentially waiting for a certain time period for funds to arrive to initiate the payment.

        This is a implementation of a delta access.
        If this data element is contained, the entries "dateFrom" and "dateTo" might be ignored by the ASPSP

        The addressed payment product endpoint, e.g. for SEPA Credit Transfers (SCT).
        The ASPSP will publish which of the payment products/endpoints will be supported.

        The following payment products are supported:
          - domestic-swiss-credit-transfers-isr
          - domestic-swiss-credit-transfers
          - domestic-swiss-credit-transfers-qr
          - domestic-swiss-foreign-credit-transfers
          - swiss-sepa-credit-transfers
          - swiss-cross-border-credit-transfers

          - pain.001-cross-border-credit-transfers
          - pain.001-swiss-six-credit-transfers

        **Remark:** For all SEPA Credit Transfer based endpoints which accept XML encoding,
        the XML pain.001 schemes provided by EPC are supported by the ASPSP as a minimum for the body content.
        Further XML schemes might be supported by some communities.

        **Remark:** For cross-border and TARGET-2 payments only community wide pain.001 schemes do exist.
        There are plenty of country specificic scheme variants.

        Type of links admitted in this response (which might be extended by single ASPSPs as indicated in its XS2A
        documentation):
          * 'scaRedirect': 
            In case of an SCA Redirect Approach, the ASPSP is transmitting the link to which to redirect the 
            PSU browser.
          * 'scaOAuth': 
            In case of an OAuth2 based Redirect Approach, the ASPSP is transmitting the link where the configuration 
            of the OAuth2 Server is defined. 
            The configuration follows the OAuth 2.0 Authorisation Server Metadata specification. 
        * 'confirmation': 
          Might be added by the ASPSP if either the "scaRedirect" or "scaOAuth" hyperlink is returned 
          in the same response message. 
          This hyperlink defines the URL to the resource which needs to be updated with 
            * a confirmation code as retrieved after the plain redirect authentication process with the ASPSP authentication server or
            * an access token as retrieved by submitting an authorization code after the integrated OAuth based authentication process with the ASPSP authentication server.
          * 'startAuthorisation': 
            In case, where an explicit start of the transaction authorisation is needed, 
            but no more data needs to be updated (no authentication method to be selected, 
            no PSU identification nor PSU authentication data to be uploaded).
          * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuIdentification': 
            The link to the authorisation end-point, where the authorisation sub-resource has to be generated 
            while uploading the PSU identification data.
          * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuAuthentication':
            The link to the authorisation end-point, where the authorisation sub-resource has to be generated 
            while uploading the PSU authentication data.

            application layer in uploading.
          * 'startAuthorisationWithAuthenticationMethodSelection':
            The link to the authorisation end-point, where the authorisation sub-resource has to be generated 
            while selecting the authentication method. This link is contained under exactly the same conditions 
            as the data element 'scaMethods'

            The link to the Establish Account Information Consent resource created by this request. 
            This link can be used to retrieve the resource data. 
          * 'status': 
            The link to retrieve the status of the account information consent.

        A list of hyperlinks to be recognised by the TPP. The actual hyperlinks used in the
        response depend on the dynamical decisions of the ASPSP when processing the request.

        **Remark:** All links can be relative or full links, to be decided by the ASPSP.

        Type of links admitted in this response, (further links might be added for ASPSP defined
        extensions):

        - 'scaRedirect':
          In case of an SCA Redirect Approach, the ASPSP is transmitting the link to which to
          redirect the PSU browser.
        - 'scaOAuth':
          In case of a SCA OAuth2 Approach, the ASPSP is transmitting the URI where the configuration of the Authorisation Server can be retrieved. The configuration follows the OAuth 2.0 Authorisation Server Metadata specification.
        * 'confirmation': 
          Might be added by the ASPSP if either the "scaRedirect" or "scaOAuth" hyperlink is returned 
          in the same response message. 
          This hyperlink defines the URL to the resource which needs to be updated with 
            * a confirmation code as retrieved after the plain redirect authentication process with the ASPSP authentication server or
            * an access token as retrieved by submitting an authorization code after the integrated OAuth based authentication process with the ASPSP authentication server.
        - 'updatePsuIdentification': 
          The link to the authorisation or cancellation authorisation sub-resource, 
          where PSU identification data needs to be uploaded.
        - 'startAuthorisationWithPsuAuthentication':
          The link to the authorisation or cancellation authorisation sub-resource,
          where PSU authentication data needs to be uploaded.
        - 'startAuthorisationWithEncryptedPsuAuthentication':
            Same as startAuthorisactionWithPsuAuthentication where the authentication data need to be encrypted on
            application layer in uploading.
        - 'selectAuthenticationMethod':
          The link to the authorisation or cancellation authorisation sub-resource,
          where the selected authentication method needs to be uploaded.
          This link is contained under exactly the same conditions as the data element 'scaMethods'.
        - 'authoriseTransaction':
          The link to the authorisation or cancellation authorisation sub-resource,
          where the authorisation data has to be uploaded, e.g. the TOP received by SMS.
        - 'scaStatus':
          The link to retrieve the scaStatus of the corresponding authorisation sub-resource.

        Type of the authentication method.

        More authentication types might be added during implementation projects and documented in the ASPSP documentation.

          - 'SMS_OTP': An SCA method, where an OTP linked to the transaction to be authorised is sent to the PSU through a SMS channel.
          - 'CHIP_OTP': An SCA method, where an OTP is generated by a chip card, e.g. a TOP derived from an EMV cryptogram. 
            To contact the card, the PSU normally needs a (handheld) device. 
            With this device, the PSU either reads the challenging data through a visual interface like flickering or 
            the PSU types in the challenge through the device key pad. 
            The device then derives an OTP from the challenge data and displays the OTP to the PSU.
          - 'PHOTO_OTP': An SCA method, where the challenge is a QR code or similar encoded visual data
            which can be read in by a consumer device or specific mobile app.
            The device resp. the specific app than derives an OTP from the visual challenge data and displays
            the OTP to the PSU.
          - 'PUSH_OTP': An OTP is pushed to a dedicated authentication APP and displayed to the PSU.
          - 'SMTP_OTP': An OTP is sent via email to the PSU.

        - SMS_OTP

        Generic body for a bulk payment initation entry.

        The bulk entry type is a type which follows the JSON formats for the supported products for single payments
        excluding the data elements (if supported):
          * debtorAccount
          * requestedExecutionDate,
          * requestedExecutionTime.
        These data elements may not be contained in any bulk entry.

        This data object can be used to represent valid bulk payment initiations entry for the following JSON based payment product,
        which where defined in the Implementation Guidelines:

          * domestic-swiss-credit-transfers-isr
          * domestic-swiss-credit-transfers

        For the convenience of the implementer additional which are already predefinded in the Implementation Guidelines
        are included (but commented in source code), such that an ASPSP may add them easily.

        Take care: Since the format is intended to fit for all payment products
        there are additional conditions which are NOT covered by this specification.

        This data element might be contained, if SCA is required and if the PSU has a choice between different
        authentication methods.

        Depending on the risk management of the ASPSP this choice might be offered before or after the PSU
        has been identified with the first relevant factor, or if an access token is transported.

        If this data element is contained, then there is also a hyperlink of type 'startAuthorisationWithAuthenticationMethodSelection'
        contained in the response body.

        These methods shall be presented towards the PSU for selection by the TPP.

      description: |
        This data element is containing information about the status of the SCA method applied.

        The following codes are defined for this data type.

          * 'received':
            An authorisation or cancellation-authorisation resource has been created successfully.
          * 'psuIdentified':
            The PSU related to the authorisation or cancellation-authorisation resource has been identified.
          * 'psuAuthenticated':
            The PSU related to the authorisation or cancellation-authorisation resource has been identified and authenticated e.g. by a password or by an access token.
          * 'scaMethodSelected':
            The PSU/TPP has selected the related SCA routine.
            If the SCA method is chosen implicitly since only one SCA method is available,
            then this is the first status to be reported instead of 'received'.
          * 'unconfirmed':
            SCA is technically successfully finalised by the PSU, but the authorisation resource needs a confirmation command by the TPP yet. 
          * 'started':
            The addressed SCA routine has been started.
          * 'finalised':
            The SCA routine has been finalised successfully (including a potential confirmation command). 
            This is a final status of the authorisation resource.
          * 'failed':
            The SCA routine failed.
            This is a final status of the authorisation resource.
          * 'exempted':
            SCA was exempted for the related transaction, the related authorisation is successful.
            This is a final status of the authorisation resource.

          Settlement on the creditor's account has been completed.
        - 'ACCP': 'AcceptedCustomerProfile' -
          Preceding check of technical validation was successful.
          Customer profile check was also successful.
        - 'ACSC': 'AcceptedSettlementCompleted' -
          Settlement on the debtoro?=s account has been completed.

          **Usage:** this can be used by the first agent to report to the debtor that the transaction has been completed.

          **Warning:** this status is provided for transaction status reasons, not for financial information.
          It can only be used after bilateral agreement.
        - 'ACSP': 'AcceptedSettlementInProcess' -
          All preceding checks such as technical validation and customer profile were successful and therefore the payment initiation has been accepted for execution.
        - 'ACTC': 'AcceptedTechnicalValidation' -
          Authentication and syntactical and semantical validation are successful.
        - 'ACWC': 'AcceptedWithChange' -
          Instruction is accepted but a change will be made, such as date or remittance not sent.
        - 'ACWP': 'AcceptedWithoutPosting' -
          Payment instruction included in the credit transfer is accepted without being posted to the creditor customero?=s account.
        - 'RCVD': 'Received' -
          Payment initiation has been received by the receiving agent.
        - 'PDNG': 'Pending' -
          Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation is pending.
          Further checks and status update will be performed.
        - 'RJCT': 'Rejected' -
          Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation has been rejected.
        - 'CANC': 'Cancelled'
          Payment initiation has been cancelled before execution
          Remark: This codeis accepted as new code by ISO20022.
        - 'ACFC': 'AcceptedFundsChecked' -
          Preceding check of technical validation and customer profile was successful and an automatic funds check was positive .
          Remark: This code is accepted as new code by ISO20022.
        - 'PATC': 'PartiallyAcceptedTechnical'
          Correct The payment initiation needs multiple authentications, where some but not yet all have been performed. Syntactical and semantical validations are successful.
          Remark: This code is accepted as new code by ISO20022.
        - 'PART': 'PartiallyAccepted' -
          A number of transactions have been accepted, whereas another number of transactions have not yet achieved 'accepted' status.
          Remark: This code may be used only in case of bulk payments. It is only used in a situation where all mandated authorisations have been applied, but some payments have been rejected.
