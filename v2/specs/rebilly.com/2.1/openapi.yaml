    # Introduction
    The Rebilly API is built on HTTP.  Our API is RESTful.  It has predictable
    resource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also
    accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.  You can use your favorite
    HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Rebilly's API, or
    you can use one of our SDKs (currently available in [PHP](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-php)
    and [Javascript](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-js-sdk)).

    We have other APIs that are also available.  Every action from our [app](https://app.rebilly.com)
    is supported by an API which is documented and available for use so that you
    may automate any workflows necessary.  This document contains the most commonly
    integrated resources.

    # Authentication

    When you sign up for an account, you are given your first secret API key.
    You can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may
    need to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the
    Rebilly API by providing your secret key in the request header.

    Rebilly offers three forms of authentication:  secret key, publishable key, JSON Web Tokens, and public signature key.
    - [Secret API key](#section/Authentication/SecretApiKey): used for requests made
      from the server side. Never share these keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
    - [Publishable API key](#section/Authentication/PublishableApiKey): used for 
      requests from the client side. For now can only be used to create 
      a [Payment Token](#operation/PostToken) and 
      a [File token](#operation/PostFile).
    - [JWT](#section/Authentication/JWT): short lifetime tokens that can be assigned a specific expiration time.

    Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.

    # Errors
    Rebilly follow's the error response format proposed in [RFC 7807](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) also known as Problem Details for HTTP APIs.  As with our normal API responses, your client must be prepared to gracefully handle additional members of the response.

    ## Forbidden
    &lt;RedocResponse pointer={"#/components/responses/Forbidden"} /&gt;

    ## Conflict
    &lt;RedocResponse pointer={"#/components/responses/Conflict"} /&gt;

    ## NotFound
    &lt;RedocResponse pointer={"#/components/responses/NotFound"} /&gt;

    ## Unauthorized
    &lt;RedocResponse pointer={"#/components/responses/Unauthorized"} /&gt;

    ## ValidationError
    &lt;RedocResponse pointer={"#/components/responses/ValidationError"} /&gt;

    # SDKs

    Rebilly offers a Javascript SDK and a PHP SDK to help interact with
    the API.  However, no SDK is required to use the API.

    Rebilly also offers [FramePay](https://docs.rebilly.com/docs/developer-docs/framepay/),
     a client-side iFrame-based solution to help
    create payment tokens while minimizing PCI DSS compliance burdens
    and maximizing the customizability. [FramePay](https://docs.rebilly.com/docs/developer-docs/framepay/)
    is interacting with the [payment tokens creation operation](#operation/PostToken).

    ## Javascript SDK

    Installation and usage instructions can be found [here](https://docs.rebilly.com/docs/developer-docs/sdks).
    SDK code examples are included in these docs.

    ## PHP SDK
    For all PHP SDK examples provided in these docs you will need to configure the `$client`.
    You may do it like this:

    ```php
    $client = new Rebilly\Client([
        'apiKey' =&gt; 'YourApiKeyHere',
        'baseUrl' =&gt; 'https://api.rebilly.com',
    ]);
    ```

    # Using filter with collections
    Rebilly provides collections filtering. You can use `?filter` param on collections to define which records should be shown in the response.

    Here is filter format description:

    - Fields and values in filter are separated with `:`: `?filter=firstName:John`.

    - Sub-fields are separated with `.`: `?filter=billingAddress.country:US`.

    - Multiple filters are separated with `;`: `?filter=firstName:John;lastName:Doe`. They will be joined with `AND` logic. In this example: `firstName:John` AND `lastName:Doe`.

    - You can use multiple values using `,` as values separator: `?filter=firstName:John,Bob`. Multiple values specified for a field will be joined with `OR` logic. In this example: `firstName:John` OR `firstName:Bob`.

    - To negate the filter use `!`: `?filter=firstName:!John`. Note that you can negate multiple values like this: `?filter=firstName:!John,!Bob`. This filter rule will exclude all Johns and Bobs from the response.

    - You can use range filters like this: `?filter=amount:1..10`.

    - You can use gte (greater than or equals) filter like this: `?filter=amount:1..`, or lte (less than or equals) than filter like this: `?filter=amount:..10`. This also works for datetime-based fields.

    - You can create some [predefined values lists](https://user-api-docs.rebilly.com/#tag/Lists) and use them in filter: `?filter=firstName:@yourListName`. You can also exclude list values: `?filter=firstName:!@yourListName`.

    - Datetime-based fields accept values formatted using RFC 3339 like this: `?filter=createdTime:2021-02-14T13:30:00Z`. 

    # Expand to include embedded objects
    Rebilly provides the ability to pre-load additional 
    objects with a request. 

    You can use `?expand` param on most requests to expand
    and include embedded objects within the
    `_embedded` property of the response.

    The `_embedded` property contains an array of 
    objects keyed by the expand parameter value(s).

    You may expand multiple objects by passing them
    as comma-separated to the expand value like so:

    ```
    ?expand=recentInvoice,customer
    ```

    And in the response, you would see:

    ```
    "_embedded": [
        "recentInvoice": {...},
        "customer": {...}
    ]
    ```
    Expand may be utilitized not only on `GET` requests but also on `PATCH`, `POST`, `PUT` requests too.


    # Getting started guide

    Rebilly's API has over 300 operations.  That's more than you'll 
    need to implement your use cases.  If you have a use 
    case you would like to implement, please consult us for
    feedback on the best API operations for the task.

    Our getting started guide will demonstrate a basic order form use
    case.  It will allow us to highlight core resources
    in Rebilly that will be helpful for many other use cases
    too.

    Within 25 minutes, you'll have sent API requests (via our console)
    to create a subscription order.

      A File is an entity that can store a physical file and some metadata. It also provides an easy access to
      its size, mime-type, user-defined tags and description thus allowing easy sorting and searching among stored
      files.
      There are several methods of file uploading available: multipart/form-data encoded form, RAW POST (by sending
      file contents as POST body), fetching from URL (by providing the file URL via 'url' param)
      Attachment is an entity that is used to link a File to one or multiple objects like Customer, Dispute, Payment,
      Transaction, Order, Plan, Product, Invoice, Note. That allows to quickly find and use files related to
      those specific entities.

      Payment tokens are used to reduce the scope of PCI DSS compliance.  A payment
      token can be made using a different authentication scheme (refer to the public key
      authentication scheme in the Authentication section), which allows you to
      create a payment token directly from the browser, bypassing the need to send
      sensitive cardholder info to your servers.  We recommend using this with our
      Rebilly.js library, which helps you wire a form into this API resource and create
      payment tokens.
    name: Payment Tokens

      Plans are a template for making a subscription.  For example, you may have a plan
      that has a 30-day free trial followed by a recurring charge of $19.95 per month
      until canceled.  The combination of the plan and a request to make an order
      will apply those instructions to create the invoices according to the plan's
      schedule.
    name: Plans

        If you wish to create the customer with a predefined
        ID (which we recommend to prevent duplication), you
        may use our `PUT` request described below.

        Get available payment methods for a specific transaction or a purchase.

        The payment methods order shown to a customer **SHOULD** be the same as the order in the response.

        The list of available methods is generated from available [Gateway Accounts](https://user-api-docs.rebilly.com/tag/Gateway-Accounts)
        intersected with the last matched [Rules Engine](https://user-api-docs.rebilly.com/tag/Rules#operation/PutEventRule)
        `adjust-ready-to-pay` action on `ready-to-pay-requested` event.

        If there were no actions matched for the specific request – all methods supported by the Gateway Accounts are sent.

        To invert this behavior – place an all-matching rule at the very end of the `ready-to-pay-requested` event in
        Rules Engine with an empty `paymentMethods` property of the `adjust-ready-to-pay` action.

        is the recommended way to
        create a payment token because it minimizes
        PCI DSS compliance.  Once a payment token
        is created, it can only be used once.

        A payment token expires upon first use
        or within 30 minutes of the token creation
        (whichever comes first).

        Create a transaction of type `sale` or `authorize`.
        This endpoint supports two main styles of transactions:
          1. A real-time decision and response.
          2. User approval/interaction is required.

        A real-time decision is very familiar.  You send a request, and
        inspect the `result` of the response for `approved` or `declined`.

        However, many transactions, especially those for alternative
        methods, require the user to interact with a 3rd party.  You
        may be able to envision PayPal, for example, the user must
        give permission to complete the payment (or accept the
        billing agreement).

        Even payment cards may require user approval in the case of
        3D secure authentication.  In the event that approval is
        required, you will receive a response back and notice
        that the `result` is `unknown`.  You will find that the
        `status` is `waiting-approval`. And you will find in the
        `_links` section of the response a link for the `approvalUrl`.

        In this case you would either open the `approvalUrl` in an
        iframe or in a pop (better workflow for mobile).
