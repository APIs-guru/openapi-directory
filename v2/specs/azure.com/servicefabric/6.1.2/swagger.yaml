      The version of this API. This is a required parameter and its value must be "6.0".

      Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.

      Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.

  ClusterHealthChunkQueryDescriptionOptionalBodyParam:
    description: |
      Describes the cluster and application health policies used to evaluate the cluster health and the filters to select which cluster entities to be returned.
      If the cluster health policy is present, it is used to evaluate the cluster events and the cluster nodes. If not present, the health evaluation uses the cluster health policy defined in the cluster manifest or the default cluster health policy.
      By default, each application is evaluated using its specific application health policy, defined in the application manifest, or the default health policy, if no policy is defined in manifest.
      If the application health policy map is specified, and it has an entry for an application, the specified application health policy
      is used to evaluate the application health.
      Users can specify very flexible filters to select which cluster entities to include in response. The selection can be done based on the entities health state and based on the hierarchy.
      The query can return multi-level children of the entities based on the specified filters. For example, it can return one application with a specified name, and for this application, return
      only services that are in Error or Warning, and all partitions and replicas for one of these services.

  ImmediateOptionalQueryParam:
    default: false
    description: |
      A flag which indicates whether the report should be sent immediately.
      A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store.
      If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from Http Gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the Http Gateway Application is using.
      This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible.
      Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the Http Gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the Gateway.
      If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the Http Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration.
      This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing.
      By default, reports are not sent immediately.

      Allows filtering of the services health state objects returned in the result of services health query based on their health state.
      The possible values for this parameter include integer value of one of the following health states.
      Only services that match the filter are returned. All services are used to evaluate the aggregated health state.
      If not specified, all entries are returned. The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these value
      obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator. For example, if the provided value is 6 then health state of services with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) will be returned.

      - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.
      - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.
      - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.
      - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.
      - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.
      - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.

        For clusters that have the Repair Manager Service configured,
        this API provides a way to create repair tasks that run automatically or manually.
        For repair tasks that run automatically, an appropriate repair executor
        must be running for each repair action to run automatically.
        These are currently only available in specially-configured Azure Cloud Services.

        To create a manual repair task, provide the set of impacted node names and the
        expected impact. When the state of the created repair task changes to approved,
        you can safely perform repair actions on those nodes.

        The query description allows users to specify health policies for evaluating the cluster and its children.
        Users can specify very flexible filters to select which cluster entities to return. The selection can be done based on the entities health state and based on the hierarchy.
        The query can return multi-level children of the entities based on the specified filters. For example, it can return one application with a specified name, and for this application, return
        only services that are in Error or Warning, and all partitions and replicas for one of these services.

All versions of the application type matching the application type name are returned, with each version returned as one application type. The response includes the name, version, status and other details about the application type. This is a paged query, meaning that if not all of the application types fit in a page, one page of results is returned as well as a continuation token which can be used to get the next page. For example, if there are 10 application types but a page only fits the first 3 application types, or if max results is set to 3, then 3 is returned. To access the rest of the results, retrieve subsequent pages by using the returned continuation token in the next query. An empty continuation token is returned if there are no subsequent pages.

        - StartNodeTransition

        If force is false, then the specified user-induced operation will be gracefully stopped and cleaned up.  If force is true, the command will be aborted, and some internal state
        may be left behind.  Specifying force as true should be used with care.  Calling this API with force set to true is not allowed until this API has already
        been called on the same test command with force set to false first, or unless the test command already has an OperationState of OperationState.RollingBack.
        Clarification: OperationState.RollingBack means that the system will/is be cleaning up internal system state caused by executing the command.  It will not restore data if the
        test command was to cause data loss.  For example, if you call StartDataLoss then call this API, the system will only clean up internal state from running the command.
        It will not restore the target partition's data, if the command progressed far enough to cause data loss.

        Important note:  if this API is invoked with force==true, internal state may be left behind.

        This API will induce data loss for the specified partition. It will trigger a call to the OnDataLoss API of the partition.
        Actual data loss will depend on the specified DataLossMode
        PartialDataLoss - Only a quorum of replicas are removed and OnDataLoss is triggered for the partition but actual data loss depends on the presence of in-flight replication.
        FullDataLoss - All replicas are removed hence all data is lost and OnDataLoss is triggered.

        This API should only be called with a stateful service as the target.

        Calling this API with a system service as the target is not advised.

        Note:  Once this API has been called, it cannot be reversed. Calling CancelOperation will only stop execution and clean up internal system state.
        It will not restore data if the command has progressed far enough to cause data loss.

        Uploads contents of the file to the image store. Use this API if the file is small enough to upload again if the connection fails. The file's data needs to be added to the request body. The contents will be uploaded to the specified path. Image store service uses a mark file to indicate the availability of the folder. The mark file is an empty file named "_.dir". The mark file is generated by the image store service when all files in a folder are uploaded. When using File-by-File approach to upload application package in REST, the image store service isn't aware of the file hierarchy of the application package; you need to create a mark file per folder and upload it last, to let the image store service know that the folder is complete.

This API allows user to resume the file upload operation. user doesn't have to restart the file upload from scratch whenever there is a network interruption. Use this option if the file size is large.

        To perform a resumable file upload, user need to break the file into multiple chunks and upload these chunks to the image store one-by-one. Chunks don't have to be uploaded in order. If the file represented by the image store relative path already exists, it will be overwritten when the upload session commits.

  ApplicationTypeHealthPolicyMap:
    description: |
      Defines a map with max percentage unhealthy applications for specific application types.
      Each entry specifies as key the application type name and as value an integer that represents the MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications percentage used to evaluate the applications of the specified application type.

      The application type health policy map can be used during cluster health evaluation to describe special application types.
      The application types included in the map are evaluated against the percentage specified in the map, and not with the global MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications defined in the cluster health policy.
      The applications of application types specified in the map are not counted against the global pool of applications.
      For example, if some applications of a type are critical, the cluster administrator can add an entry to the map for that application type
      and assign it a value of 0% (that is, do not tolerate any failures).
      All other applications can be evaluated with MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications set to 20% to tolerate some failures out of the thousands of application instances.
      The application type health policy map is used only if the cluster manifest enables application type health evaluation using the configuration entry for HealthManager/EnableApplicationTypeHealthEvaluation.

      of NodeTypeInclusionList and ApplicationInclusionList. For example, it is not possible to specify "fault this application only when it is on that node type."
      Once an entity is included in either NodeTypeInclusionList or ApplicationInclusionList, that entity cannot be excluded using ChaosTargetFilter. Even if
      applicationX does not appear in ApplicationInclusionList, in some Chaos iteration applicationX can be faulted because it happens to be on a node of nodeTypeY that is included
      in NodeTypeInclusionList. If both NodeTypeInclusionList and ApplicationInclusionList are null or empty, an ArgumentException is thrown.

      ApplicationInclusionList:

          A list of application URI's to include in Chaos faults.
          All replicas belonging to services of these applications are amenable to replica faults (restart replica, remove replica, move primary, and move secondary) by Chaos.
          Chaos may restart a code package only if the code package hosts replicas of these applications only.
          If an application does not appear in this list, it can still be faulted in some Chaos iteration if the application ends up on a node of a node type that is included in NodeTypeInclusionList.
          However if applicationX is tied to nodeTypeY through placement constraints and applicationX is absent from ApplicationInclusionList and nodeTypeY is absent from NodeTypeInclusionList, then applicationX will never be faulted.
          At most 1000 application names can be included in this list, to increase this number, a config upgrade is required for MaxNumberOfApplicationsInChaosEntityFilter configuration.

          If a nodetype (say NodeTypeX) does not appear in the NodeTypeInclusionList, then node level faults (like NodeRestart) will never be enabled for the nodes of
          NodeTypeX, but code package and replica faults can still be enabled for NodeTypeX if an application in the ApplicationInclusionList.
          happens to reside on a node of NodeTypeX.
          At most 100 node type names can be included in this list, to increase this number, a config upgrade is required for MaxNumberOfNodeTypesInChaosEntityFilter configuration.

          Each entry specifies as key the application type name and as value an integer that represents the MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications percentage used to evaluate the applications of the specified application type.

          The application type health policy map can be used during cluster health evaluation to describe special application types.
          The application types included in the map are evaluated against the percentage specified in the map, and not with the global MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications defined in the cluster health policy.
          The applications of application types specified in the map are not counted against the global pool of applications.
          For example, if some applications of a type are critical, the cluster administrator can add an entry to the map for that application type
          and assign it a value of 0% (that is, do not tolerate any failures).
          All other applications can be evaluated with MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications set to 20% to tolerate some failures out of the thousands of application instances.
          The application type health policy map is used only if the cluster manifest enables application type health evaluation using the configuration entry for HealthManager/EnableApplicationTypeHealthEvaluation.

          The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of applications that can be unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error.
          If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy application, the health is evaluated as Warning.
          This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy applications over the total number of application instances in the cluster, excluding applications of application types that are included in the ApplicationTypeHealthPolicyMap.

          If not specified, default value is None, unless the deployed service package id is specified. If the filter has default value and deployed service package id is specified, the matching deployed service package is returned.
          The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator.
          For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches deployed service packages with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4).

          - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.
          - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.
          - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.
          - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.

        description: |
          The description of the health information. It represents free text used to add human readable information about the report.
          The maximum string length for the description is 4096 characters.
          If the provided string is longer, it will be automatically truncated.
          When truncated, the last characters of the description contain a marker "[Truncated]", and total string size is 4096 characters.
          The presence of the marker indicates to users that truncation occurred.
          Note that when truncated, the description has less than 4096 characters from the original string.

      HealthState:
        $ref: "#/definitions/HealthState"
        description: The health state of a Service Fabric entity such as Cluster, Node, Application, Service, Partition, Replica etc.
      Property:
        description: |
          The property of the health information. An entity can have health reports for different properties.
          The property is a string and not a fixed enumeration to allow the reporter flexibility to categorize the state condition that triggers the report.
          For example, a reporter with SourceId "LocalWatchdog" can monitor the state of the available disk on a node,
          so it can report "AvailableDisk" property on that node.
          The same reporter can monitor the node connectivity, so it can report a property "Connectivity" on the same node.
          In the health store, these reports are treated as separate health events for the specified node.

          Together with the SourceId, the property uniquely identifies the health information.
        type: string
      RemoveWhenExpired:
        description: |
          Value that indicates whether the report is removed from health store when it expires.
          If set to true, the report is removed from the health store after it expires.
          If set to false, the report is treated as an error when expired. The value of this property is false by default.
          When clients report periodically, they should set RemoveWhenExpired false (default).
          This way, is the reporter has issues (eg. deadlock) and can't report, the entity is evaluated at error when the health report expires.
          This flags the entity as being in Error health state.
        type: boolean
      SequenceNumber:
        description: |
          The sequence number for this health report as a numeric string.
          The report sequence number is used by the health store to detect stale reports.
          If not specified, a sequence number is auto-generated by the health client when a report is added.
        type: string
      SourceId:
        description: |

      TimeToLiveInMilliSeconds:
        description: |
          The duration for which this health report is valid. This field is using ISO8601 format for specifying the duration.
          When clients report periodically, they should send reports with higher frequency than time to live.
          If clients report on transition, they can set the time to live to infinite.
          When time to live expires, the health event that contains the health information
          is either removed from health store, if RemoveWhenExpired is true, or evaluated at error, if RemoveWhenExpired false.

          If not specified, time to live defaults to infinite value.

    properties:
      HealthStateFilter:
        default: 0
        description: |
          The filter for the health state of the nodes. It allows selecting nodes if they match the desired health states.
          The possible values are integer value of one of the following health states. Only nodes that match the filter are returned. All nodes are used to evaluate the cluster aggregated health state.
          If not specified, default value is None, unless the node name is specified. If the filter has default value and node name is specified, the matching node is returned.
          The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator.
          For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches nodes with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4).

          - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.
          - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.
          - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.
          - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.
          - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.
          - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.

          If the node exists, it is included in the cluster health chunk if the health state matches the other filter properties.
          If not specified, all nodes that match the parent filters (if any) are taken into consideration and matched against the other filter members, like health state filter.

          If not specified, default value is None, unless the partition id is specified. If the filter has default value and partition id is specified, the matching partition is returned.
          The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator.
          For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches partitions with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4).

          - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.
          - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.
          - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.
          - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.

          If the partition exists, it is included in the cluster health chunk if it respects the other filter properties.

          If not specified, default value is None, unless the replica id is specified. If the filter has default value and replica id is specified, the matching replica is returned.
          The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator.
          For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches replicas with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4).

          - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.
          - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

          The possible values are integer value of one of the following health states. Only services that match the filter are returned. All services are used to evaluate the cluster aggregated health state.
          If not specified, default value is None, unless the service name is specified. If the filter has default value and service name is specified, the matching service is returned.
          The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator.
          For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches services with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4).

          - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.
          - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.
          - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.
          - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.

      This placement policy is usually used with fault domains in scenarios where the Service Fabric cluster is geographically distributed in order to indicate that a service�s primary replica should be located in a particular fault domain, which in geo-distributed scenarios usually aligns with regional or datacenter boundaries. Note that since this is an optimization it is possible that the Primary replica may not end up located in this domain due to failures, capacity limits, or other constraints.

      Describes the policy to be used for placement of a Service Fabric service where two replicas from the same partition should never be placed in the same fault or upgrade domain.

      While this is not common it can expose the service to an increased risk of concurrent failures due to unplanned outages or other cases of subsequent/concurrent failures. As an example, consider a case where replicas are deployed across different data center, with one replica per location. In the event that one of the datacenters goes offline, normally the replica that was placed in that datacenter will be packed into one of the remaining datacenters. If this is not desirable then this policy should be set.

          The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of partitions that can be unhealthy before the service is considered in error.
          If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy partition, the health is evaluated as Warning.
          The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy partitions over the total number of partitions in the service.
