If a timeout is 0 or greater, the batch is sorted oldest first. Otherwise, if timeout is a negative number, the transcript is paginated and sorted newest first. Specify a timeout for long polling (which delays the server sending back results for up to n seconds or until results are available, whichever comes first), or default to 0 for immediate results. Optionally record your status as online along with sharing the latest message you've seen with the other conversation participant. Optionally specify a gt_message_id to retrieve only messages with an ID greater than that specified (such as greater than the latest message ID received in the last poll). Optionally only poll for messages authored by the other person in the conversation, and echo messages authored by you when sending, for a perceived increase in performance. Optionally only retrieve messages that were posted from within the current access token's bubble. Optionally specify a date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD to retrieve a transcript of messages from a single day. When record_seen is set to true, the new message count for the conversation is reset to zero.

If a timeout is 0 or greater, the batch is sorted oldest first. Otherwise, if timeout is a negative number, the transcript is paginated and sorted newest first. Specify a timeout for long polling (which delays the server sending back results for up to n seconds or until results are available, whichever comes first), or default to 0 for immediate results. Optionally record your status as online along with sharing the latest message you've seen with other group members. Optionally specify a gt_message_id to retrieve only messages with an ID greater than that specified (such as greater than the latest message ID received in the last poll). Optionally only poll for messages authored by other members of the group, and echo messages authored by you when sending, for a perceived increase in performance. Optionally only retrieve messages that were posted from within the current access token's bubble. Optionally specify a date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD to retrieve a transcript of messages from a single day. When record_seen is set to true, the new message count for the group is reset to zero.

      description: "Invite users to into your current access token's bubble by having Dazah send out email invitations on your behalf. The invitation sends users to begin the OAuth flow for the current application (based on the settings specified in the application's profile), and therefore they will be redirected to the application upon signing up / logging in. Upon doing so, if they aren't already, they will automatically be connected with you as well. If your current access token does not escape the bubble, the invitation will specify you wish to connect within the application's name. If your current access token escapes the bubble, the invitation will specify you wish to connect within Dazah. Submit either a list of emails, or a LinkedIn or Outlook CSV file. You can retrieve your LinkedIn CSV file by exporting your LinkedIn Connections at https://www.linkedin.com/people/export-settings. You can retrieve your Outlook CSV file by using the Outlook Import and Export Wizard. This endpoint buckets the invitations into four categories: Existing invites are existing users who are already connected with you within the current bubble, and are therefore not emailed; Discovered invites are existing Dazah users who are available to be connected with within the current bubble, and are therefore not emailed. Now that they have been discovered, the users/{:ID}/meet API endpoint may be used to connect with them; Invalid invites are existing Dazah users who are unavailable to be connected with, because they have deactivated accounts, are muting you, etc., and are therefore not emailed; Emailed invites are queued to receive an invitation within approximately 1 hour. Note that if you are attempting to invite an existing Dazah user who does not currently exist within your current access token's bubble, they will fall within the Discovered bucket if your current access token escapes the bubble, but will be emailed an invitation to join the application if your current access token does not escape the bubble."

      description: Filter and perform a weighted search against user profile fields, CV fields, and metadata by specifying a string to search on for each individual field. By default, results are filtered such that all words in the string must exist, unless you seprate the words with OR. To perform a weighted search (as opposed to filtering), specify the weight (from 0-100) the search algorithm should assign to the field. You can optionally exclude users who you are already in or not in conversations with, exclude users who you previously skipped, or exclude users who you are muting. By doing so, you can effectively customize your own matching algorithm. You can specify geo coordinates to only find users a certain distance away from a specific location, or only find users within a certain distance from the OAuth'ed end-user's last known location. If your app utilizes multiple audience segments, you can specify which audiences you would like to search. You can also limit users to just those who have been recently active. You can also choose to only receive users originating from the current access token's bubble. Only users existing within the current access token's bubble will be matched, and you can only search within a group created by a bubbled user.

If you aren't already in a conversation with them, this endpoint meets them first, and then sends the message. Note that if you aren't in an existing conversation, you still must meet the criteria to meet them, meaning the user must currently be free for you to meet. You will receive an error message unless it is currently free for you to meet the user. You can use the users/{:IDS}/synergies endpoint to first determine if the user isn't already in a conversation with you and is free for you to meet and, if they aren't, how to pay to meet them. If you don't specify a message, it defaults to your custom introductory message defined in your settings.

      description: Determine your match relationship with one or more users who exist within the current access token's bubble. Under some conditions, the price to meet the user will be $0. However, if this is not the case, the PayPal URL payment method will be provided along with the price to meet the user. The PayPal API can be leveraged to send payments programatically, provided the parameters passed in remain the same to ensure that the payment is correctly recorded. Once the payment has been recorded via PayPal IPN, the price to meet the user changes to $0. You can then call the users/{:ID}/meet endpoint to meet the user.

      description: Register a new webhook for the current user/bubble combination. Specify an object_id to only be notified on an event related to that specific Conversation ID, Group ID, or User ID. Your access token must have access to the user being tracked, user you are in the conversation with, or user who created the group. You must be connected with a user in order to keep track of their online status. Alternatively, do not specify an object_id to be notified on all events that are related to conversations you're in, groups you're a member of, or users you are in conversations with. You may only have one webhook for each object_id/event. The webhook URI must reside on your own server. Webhooks do not expire when the access token used to create them expires. However, they will temporarily cease to function if the user who created them deauthorizes access to the application (effectively no longer existing within the bubble), unless/until the user reauthorizes the application using OAuth.
