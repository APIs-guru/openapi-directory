    enum:
      - summary
      - full
    in: query
    name: resultLevel
    required: false
    type: string
  BusinessCheckTypeQueryParameter:
    collectionFormat: csv
    description: |
      When creating a new check, we need to define the checks we wish to run. If this parameter is not supplied then the check will be based on a configured check type for each entity category.
        
      The checkType is make up of a comma separated list of the types of check we wish to run.

      The order is important, and must be of the form:
        - Entity Check (if you're running this). Choose one from the available options
        - ID Check (If you want this)
        - PEP Checks (again if you want this, choose one of the options)

      Entity Checks - One of:
        - "one_plus": Checks name, address and DoB against a minimum of 1 data source. (also known as a 1+1)
        - "two_plus": Checks name, address and DoB against a minimum of 2 independent data sources (also known as a 2+2)

      ID Checks - One of:
        - "id": Checks all of the identity documents, but not necessarily the entity itself independently. Use this in conjunction with a one_plus or two_plus for more.
        
      Fraud Checks - One or more  of:
        - "fraudlist": Checks to see if the identity appears on any known fraud lists. Should be run after KYC/ID checks have passed.
        - "fraudid": Checks external ID services to see if details appear in fraud detection services (e.g. EmailAge or FraudNet)
        
      PEP Checks - One of:
        - "pep": Will only run PEP/Sanctions checks (no identity verification)
        - "pep_media": Will run PEP/Sanctions checks, as well as watchlist and adverse media checks. (no identity verification)
        
        * NOTE: These checks will ONLY run if either the KYC/ID checks have been run prior, or it is the only check requested.
        
      Pre-defined combinations:
        - "full": equivalent to "two_plus,id,pep_media" or "pep_media" if the target is an organisation.
        - "default": Currently defined as "two_plus,id" or "pep" if the target is an organisation.

      Custom:
        - By arrangement with Frankie you can define your own KYC check type.
        
        This will allow you to set the minimum number of matches for:
          - name 
          - date of birth
          - address
          - government id
        
        This allows for alternatives to the "standard" two_plus or one_plus (note, these can be overridden too).
        
      Profile:
        - "profile": By arrangement with Frankie you can have a "profile" check type that applies checks according to a profile that you assign to the entity from a predefined set of profiles.
        
        The profile to use will be taken from the entity.entityProfile field if set, or be run through a set of configurable rules to determine which one to use.
        
        Profiles act a little like the Pre-defined combinations above in that they can map to a defined list. But they offer a lot more besides, including rules for determining default settings, inbuild data aging and other configurable features.
        They also allow for a new result set top be returned that provides a more detailed and useful breakdown of the check/verification process.
        
        Entity Profiles are the future of checks with Frankie Financial.

    format: uuid

    type: string
  CheckTypeParameter:
    default: default
    description: |
      When creating a new check, you need to define the checks you wish to run.
        
      The checkType is make up of a comma separated list of the types of check you wish to run. The order of the requested checks is not important, they will be re-ordered by the service and in some cases, depending on your account configuration, may be skipped.

        The validation that is performed on the requested checks is to:
        - ensure the check type is known
        - is suitable for the type of entity (no KYC for organisations)
        - disallow manual (mKYC) check with any other kind of KYC
        - disallow mixing the "profile" check with any other kind of check.

      The supported check types are:

      Profile:
        - "profile": By arrangement with Frankie we will create a "profile" check type that applies checks according to a recipe that you assign to the entity from a predefined set of profiles.
        
        The profile to use will be taken from the entity.entityProfile field if set, or be run through a set of configurable rules to determine which one to use.
        
        Profiles provide a pre-defined combination of individual checkTypes (see the list below). But they offer a lot more besides, including rules for determining default settings, inbuilt data aging and other configurable features.
        They also allow for a new result set top be returned that provides a more detailed and useful breakdown of the check/verification process.
        
        Entity Profiles are a recent feature (since v1.4.0) but are now the default checkType to use with Frankie Financial.

      **Individual Check Types**

      Whilst we strongly recommend the use of the "profile" checktype, it does map of any combination of the types below. If you wish to use these individually, please contact developer support for more details on how to use these effectively.

      Entity Checks - One of:
        - "one_plus": Checks name, address and DoB against a minimum of 1 data source. (also known as a 1+1)
        - "two_plus": Checks name, address and DoB against a minimum of 2 independent data sources (also known as a 2+2)

      ID Checks - One of:
        - "id": Checks all of the identity documents, but not necessarily the entity itself independently. Use this in conjunction with a one_plus or two_plus for more.
        - "visa":
        
      ID Validate - One of:
        - "idvalidate": Checks to see if photo ID has had OCR scanning, ID document validation and photo comparison run against it. Can be used in conjunction with any of the KYC/ID/AML checks.
        
      Manual Check:
        - "manual": (mKYC) Checks user has a sufficient amount of operator verified ID and will then "pass" all Entity and ID related checks.
        
      Fraud Checks - One or more of:
        - "fraudlist": Checks to see if the identity appears on any known fraud lists. Should be run after KYC/ID checks have passed.
        - "fraudcheck": Checks external ID services to see if details appear in fraud detection services (e.g. EmailAge or FraudNet)
        
      PEP Checks - One of:
        - "pep": Will only run PEP/Sanctions checks (no identity verification)
        - "pep_media": Will run PEP/Sanctions checks, as well as watchlist and adverse media checks. (no identity verification)
        
        * NOTE: These checks will ONLY run if either the KYC/ID checks have been run prior, or it is the only check requested.
        
      Custom:
        - By arrangement with Frankie you can define your own KYC check type.
        
        This will allow you to set the minimum number of matches for:
          - name 
          - date of birth
          - address
          - government id
        
        This allows for alternatives to the "standard" two_plus or one_plus (note, these can be overridden too).

      Any documents, checks, entities that are created when this field has been populated will now be tied to this CustomerID + CustomerChildID combination. Just as Customers cannot see data created by other Customers, so too a Customer's Children will not be able to see each other's data.

      A Customer can see the documents/entities and checks of all their Children.

        Process a request for ownership details for an Australian organisation.

        See below for more generic international queries.

        At a minimum, you just need to supply an ACN or ABN and we can retrieve the rest.
        You also have the option of supplying company name, type (as per ABR types) and both ABN/ACN and we'll attempt to verfy that that data matches what is on record before attempting any further verification and validation.

        KYC/AML for a selection of entities associated with an organisation and/or the organisation itself can optionally be run, but not by default. To enable KYC/AML checks one or more entity categories must be provided. If such a list of entity categories is given then default checks based on configuration will be run for those categories. If a check type is also provided in the request then that type will be used for entities representing individual entities, and the AML subset of that check will be used for organisations if any. Specifying a check type without an entity category will result in an error.

        NOTE: This query will always run asynchronously and you will only ever be returned a 202 ACCEPT response, or an error.
        Results will be pushed using the Push Notification API below and you will be able to retrieve the results using the Retrieve API.

        We have supplied the 200 response in the definition below only so what will be sent to you when you later retrieve the details.

        More details on how to use this API and interpret the results can be found here:

        By default AML will be checked for just the organisation itself. If a list of entity categories is given then default checks based on configuration will be run for those categories. If a check type is also provided in the request then that type will be used for entities representing individual entities, and the AML subset of that check will be used for organisations if any.
        If no ownership query has been run, then this operation will return an error.

        Create a document object. A document object can be used to simply store data around a given identity or similar document. You can attach scans, PDFs, photos, videos, etc to the objectif you wish and these may be processed later (using the /scan function) to extract useful information. Or you can manually supply the extracted information if you choose.
        Document objects can be used to create an entity, based on extracted or supplied data; or it may be attached to an existing entity, either directly or through an ID check.

        Search for an existing document that matches the criteria supplied

        There are of course limits to what can be searched upon. For a document search to work, you must supply at a minimum:

          * idType
          * country
          * idNumber

        The service will return a list of matching documents with confidence levels.

        If you are the "owner" of the document - i.e. the same CustomerID and CustomerChildID (if relevant) - then the full details of the document will be returned, except for the contents of any attached scans.
        If you are not the owner of the document, then just the ID and confidence level is returned. You can still use this ID to retrieve any check results (see GET /document/{documentId}/checks)

        Note: At this time, we cannot perform searches on document scans. But, you can supply extraData KVPs if they're known. These will help doublecheck search results with ambiguous results.

        Create an entity object. An entity object can be used to simply store data around a given identity. You can attach ID documents, scans, PDFs, photos, videos, etc to the entity if you wish and these may be processed later (using the /scan function) to extract useful information. Or you can manually supply the  information if you choose.

        If the entity is successfully created, take the details and documents provided, and set about verifying them all.
        So for example, you might extract:

        * The name from the entity.name object
        * The address from the entity.address object
        * The DoB..

        All documents that are attached to the entity will also be verified (if possible).

        You can also specify the level of detail returned using the resultLevel parameter. You can choose "summary" or "full". For the "profile" check type you can also select "simple" to only get the entity profile result.

        SPECIAL NOTE: A "Full" response includes details of all checks and how they map against each element, along with all the details of pep/sanctions/etc checks too.

        Your account also needs to be configured to support a full response too (talk to your account manager for more information). If you're not configured for full responses, we'll only return summary level data regardless.

        Search for an existing entity that matches the criteria supplied

        Criteria are supplied in the form of a populated entity object, with the name/address/DoB details supplied.
        You can also include documents that can be used to further refine your search (see the /document/search function for minimum requirements for a document search)

        At an absolute minimum, you must supply one of the following combinations:

          * name.familyName +
          * name.givenNames
          
          or
          
          * name.familyName +
          * one identityDocument object (that meets minimum criteria)
          
        Obviously, the more data you provide, the better search results we can provide.

        The service will return a list of matching entities with confidence levels.

        If you are the "owner" of the entity - i.e. the same CustomerID and CustomerChildID (if relevant) - then the full details of the entity and any owned documents will be returned, except for the contents of any attached scans.

        If you are not the owner of the entity (or linked documents), then just the ID and confidence level is returned. You can still use this ID to retrieve any check results (see GET  /entity/{entityId}/checks and GET /document/{documentId}/checks)

        Note: This functionality must be enabled by Frankie administrators. Please contact your sales representative if you wish to discuss this.

        The entity will receive a link on their mobile and will then be guided through a series of steps to capture and OCR scan their ID, and perform a selfie comparison. We'll then attempt to verify the data received and push a notification back to the calling customer.

        At a minimum, you will need to supply the name and a MOBILE_PHONE document type.        
        If you wish to skip the detail capture and jump straight to the ID and selfie capture, the append the call with the ?phase=2 parameter.


        SPECIAL NOTE: This will only ever return a 202 response if successfully accepted. You will need to ensure your account is configured for push notifications. Contact developer supprt to arrange this.

        Take the details and documents provided in the entity, and set about verifying them all.
        So for example, you might extract:

        * The name from the entity.name object
        * The address from the entity.address object
        * The DoB..

        All documents that are presently attached to the entity will also be verified (if requested)

        You can also specify the level of detail returned using the resultLevel parameter. You can choose "summary" or "full". For the "profile" check type you can also select "simple" to only get the entity profile result.

        SPECIAL NOTE: A "Full" response includes details of all checks and how they map against each element, along with all the details of pep/sanctions/etc checks too.

        Your account also needs to be configured to support a full response too (talk to your account manager for more information). If you're not configured for full responses, we'll only return summary level data regardless.

  CheckEntityCheckResultObject:
    description: |
      Describes all of the checks that were carried out against an entity as part of our cascading check process. Because there are a number of steps involved in checking an entity, (including the use of past checks done by you or others), there is an overall summary check result that will tell you the final disposition of the the check you requested.

      So if you requested a 2+2+governmentID+pep/sanctions/etc (i.e. everything) then there would have been several checks done in order to meet this requirement. Some may have even failed, but eventually we got there. The summary gives the final assessment, based on all available data.

The score is based between 0 and 850 index points with a higher score considered lower risk while lower scores are deemed to be riskier entities. It should be used in partnership with your internal credit procedures and policies.
          Please note that the score and recommendation should be used in partnership with your company's internal credit procedures and policies. The score should not be used as the sole reason in making a decision about the entity.

          Collection of additional data points you wish to add to the activity check. These are defined in conjunction with the Customer and the device checking service being used.

          Standard values are supplied upon request:

          | kvpKey | kvpType | kvpValue |
          | ------- | -------- | -------- |
          | detectedIp | general.string | The IP address you detect the transaction coming from |
          | accountId.src | id.external | Your account identifier. Can be a SHA hash or similar |
          | accountId.dst | id.external | Target/payee account identifier. Can be a SHA hash or similar |
          | entityId | id.external | Use this to override the Frankie entityID that would be used to identify |
          | amount | general.float | Amount involved in the transaction  |
          | platform  | general.string | One of APP, WEB, MOBILE_WEB. Assumes APP if not supplied |
          |   |   |


          Like the activityType, you can also specify vendor specific additional data parameters by adding a leading underscore "_" to the kvpKey. You can set the kvpType to one of the available types, or just use general.string (recommended)

        * Any additional data extracted from the service that does not fit into the standard identity document fields will be placed into the extraData KVPs.
        
      * extractedEntity - the service will attempt to create the basics of an entity's name, address, DoB, gender from the data returned from the scan. 
        You can then use this entity data to create a new entity for a wider check if needed.
        
        * Note if you plan on doing this, make sure you include the extractedDocument reference in the "new" entity.

  DocumentVerify:
    description: |
      This is the document we wish to verify in some way, along with an entity object that contains some/all of the details we wish to verify.

      For example, if we're attempting to verify a drivers licence, we generally need to pass in a name, address, DoB, etc as well. the entity gives the structure to be able to do this. 

      Note, only the document in the "document" parameter is to be processed. any additional documents found in the entity (there shouldn't be, but given the way this has been defined, there can be) will be ignored. Only the Name, Address, DoB and Gender fields will be potentially used during the verification process.

      The EntityObject can take one of two forms.

        - It can be a single entityId - in which case the details will be pulled from the database. If using an existing document, then the entity must also own the document or the request will fail.
        - You can supply a "single use" entity with fields, etc. In this case the entity details will be used to verify the document, then will be discarded.
        
      If you wish to save the entity, use the /entity comments instead to create the entity and attach the document there.

          These will be keys in a map whose values hold the values for the individual match types. The resultant structure would look like the following. Here dob has zero matches and is not verfied but it was check, so other than the checked flag the value object is simply empty. A completely empty object would imply that match type was not checked.

              "matchTypes": {
                "address": {
                  "matchCount": 1,
                  "matchSources": [ "au-elec-roll" ],
                  "checked": true,

          Only supplied in a summary result. Used to indicate the ovall risk score for the entity at this point in time, based on configurable rules.

          Some examples might include:

            * Current level of ID checks passed
            * Device ID scores
            * Current PEP/Sanctions/etc checks
            * Jurisdictional risk based on addresses, documents and other KVPs
            * Fraud check results
            
          In this case a higher score is a bad thing. General rule of thumb:

            * 0 - 30 = Low Risk
            * 31 - 50 = Medium Risk
            * 50 - 75 = High Risk
            * 75+ = Unacceptable

    description: |
      Used to describe the contents of the KVP data. 

      The general.* and raw.* types are pretty much what they say on the tin. 

      All raw.* fields will be base64 encoded so as to not interfere with JSON structuring. These are useful for returning/storing large quantities of data that doesn't necessarily require processing now, or may be useful to a calling client.

      The id.* and pii.* are used to indicate that this is data that can be used to create new document objects, or entities. They should also be treated with the utmost care and attention when it comes to securing them too.

      id.external can be used to capture an object's ID on an external service, and can potentially be searchable in the index 
      Note - This is different from a result.id.

      defunct is used to mark an existing KVP deleted when the value must be retained, for example for audit purposes.

      result.* are used to capture response codes and transaction IDs from external services

      error.* types can be used when processing a document that returns an error, but doesn't necessarily require a full blown error response.

  enumNotificationType:
    description: |
      Indicates the type of notification being pushed.
      - "FUNCTION": A request that you previously backgrounded has completed and this is the notification that is it complete (success is another matter)
      - "RESULT": Like the FUNCTION notification, this tells you that a previously backgrounded request has completed, and that there is a set of results in the payload pointer.
      - "EVENT": There has been a stateful change in a document, entity or some other piece of data that we are holding/monitoring for you. This is an indication that you may wish to take some action.
      - "ALERT": Like the EVENT, except that the severity of the notification indicates that action is almost certainly required.
    enum:
      - FUNCTION
      - RESULT
      - EVENT
      - ALERT
    type: string
  enumScanDataRetrievalState:
    description: |
      The reason why the scanData in a response is missing.
      - "NORMAL": The scanData was retrieved and is included. If it is empty then it was never provided or was provided empty.
      - "EXCLUDED": The retrieval request was not for 'full' data, or the object has 'ScanDelete' set so the scanData is not included
      - "FAILED": The scanData could not be retrieved from the secure document store.

      The enumScanDataRetrievalState will not usually be set in a request. If a ScannedDocumentObject in a response has a 'FAILED' retrieval state then that object should not be sent back in a future possible update. It should either be omitted or the original data should be resent if it is available from another source. However it is safe to send the object in an update with the state received in a response. Any state other than 'NORMAL' (or '') will cause the blank scanData to be ignored, but other fields in the object will be updated if needed.
    enum:
      - NORMAL
      - EXCLUDED
      - FAILED
    example: NORMAL
