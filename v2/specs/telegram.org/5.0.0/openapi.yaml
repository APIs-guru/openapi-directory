        Use this method to send answers to callback queries sent from [inline keyboards](/bots#inline-keyboards-and-on-the-fly-updating). The answer will be displayed to the user as a notification at the top of the chat screen or as an alert. On success, *True* is returned.

        Alternatively, the user can be redirected to the specified Game URL. For this option to work, you must first create a game for your bot via [@Botfather](https://t.me/botfather) and accept the terms. Otherwise, you may use links like `t.me/your_bot?start=XXXX` that open your bot with a parameter.

        Use this method to get data for high score tables. Will return the score of the specified user and several of their neighbors in a game. On success, returns an *Array* of [GameHighScore](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#gamehighscore) objects.

        This method will currently return scores for the target user, plus two of their closest neighbors on each side. Will also return the top three users if the user and his neighbors are not among them. Please note that this behavior is subject to change.

  /sendChatAction:
    post:

        Use this method when you need to tell the user that something is happening on the bot's side. The status is set for 5 seconds or less (when a message arrives from your bot, Telegram clients clear its typing status). Returns *True* on success.

        Example: The [ImageBot](https://t.me/imagebot) needs some time to process a request and upload the image. Instead of sending a text message along the lines of “Retrieving image, please wait…”, the bot may use [sendChatAction](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#sendchataction) with *action* = *upload\_photo*. The user will see a “sending photo” status for the bot.

        We only recommend using this method when a response from the bot will take a **noticeable** amount of time to arrive.

  /setPassportDataErrors:
    post:
      description: |-
        Informs a user that some of the Telegram Passport elements they provided contains errors. The user will not be able to re-submit their Passport to you until the errors are fixed (the contents of the field for which you returned the error must change). Returns *True* on success.

        Use this if the data submitted by the user doesn't satisfy the standards your service requires for any reason. For example, if a birthday date seems invalid, a submitted document is blurry, a scan shows evidence of tampering, etc. Supply some details in the error message to make sure the user knows how to correct the issues.

        Use this method to specify a url and receive incoming updates via an outgoing webhook. Whenever there is an update for the bot, we will send an HTTPS POST request to the specified url, containing a JSON-serialized [Update](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#update). In case of an unsuccessful request, we will give up after a reasonable amount of attempts. Returns *True* on success.

        If you'd like to make sure that the Webhook request comes from Telegram, we recommend using a secret path in the URL, e.g. `https://www.example.com/<token>`. Since nobody else knows your bot's token, you can be pretty sure it's us.

The user will **not** return to the group or channel automatically, but will be able to join via link, etc. The bot must be an administrator for this to work. By default, this method guarantees that after the call the user is not a member of the chat, but will be able to join it. So if the user is a member of the chat they will also be **removed** from the chat. If you don't want this, use the parameter *only\_if\_banned*. Returns *True* on success.
