        ### Description:
        Authenticates user and provides an authentication token (`X-Sds-Auth-Token`) that is required for the most operations.

        ### Precondition:
        Existing user that is **NOT** locked.

        ### Postcondition:
        User is logged in.

        ### Description:  
        Provides a hierarchical list of file system nodes (rooms, folders or files) of a given parent that are accessible by the current user.

        ### Precondition:
        Authenticated user.

        ### Postcondition:
        List of nodes is returned.

        ### Further Information:
        `EncryptionInfo` is **NOT** provided.

        ### Filtering:
        All filter fields are connected via logical conjunction (**AND**)  
        Filter string syntax: `FIELD_NAME:OPERATOR:VALUE[:VALUE...]`  

        <details style="padding-left: 10px">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; outline: none"><strong>Example</strong></summary>

        `type:eq:room:folder|perm:eq:read`  
        Get nodes where type equals (`room` **OR** `folder`) **AND** user has `read` permissions.

        </details>

        ### Filtering options:
        <details style="padding: 10px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #AAA; border-radius: 5px;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; outline: none"><strong>Expand</strong></summary>

        | `FIELD_NAME` | Filter Description | `OPERATOR` | Operator Description | `VALUE` |
        | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
        | `type` | Node type filter | `eq` | Node type equals value.<br>Multiple values are allowed and will be connected via logical disjunction (**OR**).<br>e.g. `type:eq:room:folder` | <ul><li>`room`</li><li>`folder`</li><li>`file`</li></ul> |
        | `perm` | Permission filter | `eq` | Permission equals value.<br>Multiple values are allowed and will be connected via logical disjunction (**OR**).<br>e.g. `perm:eq:read:create:delete` | <ul><li>`manage`</li><li>`read`</li><li>`change`</li><li>`create`</li><li>`delete`</li><li>`manageDownloadShare`</li><li>`manageUploadShare`</li><li>`canReadRecycleBin`</li><li>`canRestoreRecycleBin`</li><li>`canDeleteRecycleBin`</li></ul> |
        | `childPerm` | Same as `perm`, but less restrictive (applies to child nodes only).<br>Child nodes of the parent node which do not meet the filter condition<br>are **NOT** returned. | `eq` | cf. `perm` | cf. `perm` |
        | `name` | Node name filter | `cn, eq` | Node name contains / equals value. | `search String` |
        | `encrypted` | Node encryption status filter | `eq` |  | `true or false` |
        | `branchVersion` | Node branch version filter | `ge, le` | Branch version is greater / less equals than value.<br>Multiple operator values are allowed and will be connected via logical conjunction (**AND**).<br>e.g. `branchVersion:ge:1423280937404`&#124;`branchVersion:le:1523280937404` | `version number` |
        | `timestampCreation` | Creation timestamp filter | `ge, le` | Creation timestamp is greater / less equals than value.<br>Multiple operator values are allowed and will be connected via logical conjunction (**AND**).<br>e.g. `timestampCreation:ge:2016-12-31T23:00:00.123`&#124;<br>`timestampCreation:le:2018-01-01T11:00:00.540` | `Date (yyyy-MM-dd)` |
        | `timestampModification` | Modification timestamp filter | `ge, le` | Modification timestamp is greater / less equals than value.<br>Multiple operator values are allowed and will be connected via logical conjunction (**AND**).<br>e.g. `timestampModification:ge:2016-12-31T23:00:00.123`&#124;<br>`timestampModification:le:2018-01-01T11:00:00.540` | `Date (yyyy-MM-dd)` |
        | `referenceId`           | Reference ID filter               | `eq` | Reference ID equals value.   | `Integer ` |
        </details>

        ### Sorting:
        Sort string syntax: `FIELD_NAME:ORDER`  
        `ORDER` can be `asc` or `desc`.  
        Multiple sort criteria are possible.  
        Fields are connected via logical conjunction **AND**.  
        Nodes are sorted by type first, then by sent sort string.  

        <details style="padding-left: 10px">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; outline: none"><strong>Example</strong></summary>

        `name:desc|fileType:asc`  
        Sort by `name` descending **AND** `fileType` ascending.

        ### Description:  
        Restore a list of deleted nodes.

        ### Precondition:
        User has <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128275; create</span> permissions in parent room and <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128275; restore recycle bin</span> permissions.

        ### Postcondition:
        The selected files are moved from the recycle bin to the chosen productive container.

        ### Further Information:
        If no parent ID is provided, the node is restored to its previous location.  
        The default resolution strategy is `autorename` that adds numbers to the file name until the conflict is solved.  
        If an existing file is overwritten, it is moved to the recycle bin instead of the restored one.

        Download share id (if exists) gets changed if:
        - node with the same name exists in the target container
        - `resolutionStrategy` is `overwrite`
        - `keepShareLinks` is `true`

        ### Precondition:
        User has file keys for the files.  
        Only settable by users that own one of the following permissions: <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128275; manage</span>, <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128275; read</span>, <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128275; manage download share</span>, <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128275; change config</span>

        ### Postcondition:
        Stores new file keys for other users.

        ### Further Information:
        Only users with copies of the file key (encrypted with their public keys) can access a certain file.  
        This endpoint is used for the distribution of file keys amongst an authorized user base.  
        User can set file key for himself.  
        The users who already have a file key are ignored and keep the distributed file key

        ### Use `uploads` API

        ### Description:
        Finishes an upload and closes the corresponding upload channel.

        ### Precondition:
        An upload channel has been created and data has been transmitted.

        ### Postcondition:
        The upload is finished and the temporary file is moved to the productive environment.

        ### Further Information:
        The provided file name might be changed in accordance with the resolution strategy:  
        * **autorename**: changes the file name and adds a number to avoid conflicts.
        * **overwrite**: deletes any old file with the same file name.
        * **fail**: returns an error; in this case, another `PUT` request with a different file name may be sent.

        Please ensure that all chunks have been transferred correctly before finishing the upload.  
        Download share id (if exists) gets changed if:
        - node with the same name exists in the target container
        - `resolutionStrategy` is `overwrite`
        - `keepShareLinks` is `true`

        ### Node naming convention:
        * Node (room, folder, file) names are limited to **150** characters.
        * Illegal names:  
        `'CON', 'PRN', 'AUX', 'NUL', 'COM1', 'COM2', 'COM3', 'COM4', 'COM5', 'COM6', 'COM7', 'COM8', 'COM9', 'LPT1', 'LPT2', 'LPT3', 'LPT4', 'LPT5', 'LPT6', 'LPT7', 'LPT8', 'LPT9', (and any of those with an extension)`
        * Illegal characters in names:  
        `'\\', '<','>', ':', '\"', '|', '?', '*', '/', leading '-', trailing '.' `

        ### Description:  
        Requests a list of missing file keys that may be generated by the current user.  

        ### Precondition:
        User has a key pair.  
        Only returns users that owns one of the following permissions: <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128275; manage</span>, <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128275; read</span>, <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128275; manage download share</span>

        ### Postcondition:
        None.

        ### Further Information:
        Clients **SHOULD** regularly request missing file keys to provide access to files for other users.  
        The returned list is ordered by priority (emergency passwords / rescue keys are returned first).
        There is an enforced limit of **100** items per request.
        A total value greater than limit signals that there are more entries but does not necessarily reflect the precise
        number of total items.

        ### Description:
        Creates a new room at the provided parent node.  
        Creation of top level rooms provided.

        ### Precondition:
        User has <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128275; manage</span> permissions in the parent room.

        ### Postcondition:
        A new room is created.

        ### Further Information:  
        Rooms may only have other rooms as parent.  
        Rooms on top level do **NOT** have any parent.  
        Rooms may have rooms as children on n hierarchy levels.  
        If permission inheritance is disabled, there **MUST** be at least one admin user / group (with neither the group nor the user having an expiration date).

        Notes are limited to **255** characters.

        Provided (or default) classification is taken from room when file gets uploaded without any classification.

        ### Node naming convention:
        * Node (room, folder, file) names are limited to **150** characters.
        * Illegal names:  
        `'CON', 'PRN', 'AUX', 'NUL', 'COM1', 'COM2', 'COM3', 'COM4', 'COM5', 'COM6', 'COM7', 'COM8', 'COM9', 'LPT1', 'LPT2', 'LPT3', 'LPT4', 'LPT5', 'LPT6', 'LPT7', 'LPT8', 'LPT9', (and any of those with an extension)`

        `ORDER` can be `asc` or `desc`.  
        Multiple sort criteria are possible.  
        Fields are connected via logical conjunction **AND**.

        <details style="padding-left: 10px">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; outline: none"><strong>Example</strong></summary>

        `name:desc`  
        Sort by `name` descending.

        </details>

        ### Sorting options:
        <details style="padding: 10px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #AAA; border-radius: 5px;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; outline: none"><strong>Expand</strong></summary>

        ### Description:  
        Retrieve all room rescue key pairs to allow migrating room-rescue-key-encrypted file keys.

        ### Precondition:
        User has <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128275; read</span> permissions in that room.

        ### Postcondition:
        List of key pairs is returned.

        ### Further Information:
        In the case of an algorithm migration to a room rescue key pair, one should create the new key pair before deleting the old one. This allows re-encrypting file keys with the new key pair, using the old one.

        This API allows to retrieve both key pairs, in contrast to `GET /nodes/rooms/{room_id}/keypair`, which only delivers the preferred one.

        ### Description:  
        Create room rescue key pair and preserve copy of old private key.

        ### Precondition:
        User needs to be a <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128100; Room Administrator</span>.

        ### Postcondition:
        Room rescue key pair is created.  
        Copy of old private key is preserved.

        ### Further Information:
        You can submit your old private key, encrypted with your current password.  
        This allows migrating file keys encrypted with your old key pair to the new one.

        ### Description:
        Copies nodes (folder, file) to another parent.

        ### Precondition:
        Authenticated user with <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128275; read</span> permissions in the source parent and <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128275; create</span> permissions in the target parent node.

        ### Postcondition:
        Nodes are copied to target parent.

        ### Further Information:
        Nodes **MUST** be in same source parent.  
        **Rooms **CANNOT** be copied.**

        Download share id (if exists) gets changed if:
        - node with the same name exists in the target container
        - `resolutionStrategy` is `overwrite`
        - `keepShareLinks` is `true`

        ### Node naming convention:
        * Node (room, folder, file) names are limited to **150** characters.
        * Illegal names:  
        `'CON', 'PRN', 'AUX', 'NUL', 'COM1', 'COM2', 'COM3', 'COM4', 'COM5', 'COM6', 'COM7', 'COM8', 'COM9', 'LPT1', 'LPT2', 'LPT3', 'LPT4', 'LPT5', 'LPT6', 'LPT7', 'LPT8', 'LPT9', (and any of those with an extension)`
        * Illegal characters in names:  
        `'\\', '<','>', ':', '\"', '|', '?', '*', '/', leading '-', trailing '.' `

        ### Description:  
        Retrieve a list of deleted nodes in a recycle bin.

        ### Precondition:
        User can access parent room and has <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128275; read recycle bin</span> permissions.

        ### Postcondition:
        List of deleted nodes is returned.

        ### Further Information:
        Only room IDs are accepted as parent ID since only rooms may have a recycle bin.

        ### Filtering:
        All filter fields are connected via logical conjunction (**AND**)  
        Filter string syntax: `FIELD_NAME:OPERATOR:VALUE[:VALUE...]`  

        <details style="padding-left: 10px">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; outline: none"><strong>Example</strong></summary>

        `type:eq:file:folder|name:cn:searchString_1|parentPath:cn:searchString_2`  
        Get deleted nodes where type equals (`file` **OR** `folder`) **AND** deleted node name containing `searchString_1` **AND** deleted node parent path containing `searchString 2`.

        </details>

        ### Filtering options:
        <details style="padding: 10px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #AAA; border-radius: 5px;">

        | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
        | `type` | Node type filter | `eq` | Node type equals value(s).<br>Multiple values are allowed and will be connected via logical disjunction (**OR**).<br>e.g. `type:eq:folder:file` | <ul><li>`folder`</li><li>`file`</li></ul> |
        | `name` | Node name filter | `cn` | Node name contains value. | `search String` |
        | `parentPath` | Parent path filter | `cn` | Parent path contains value. | `search String` |
        | `timestampCreation` | Creation timestamp filter | `ge, le` | Creation timestamp is greater / less equals than value.<br>Multiple operator values are allowed and will be connected via logical conjunction (**AND**).<br>e.g. `timestampCreation:ge:2016-12-31`&#124;<br>`timestampCreation:le:2018-01-01` | `Date (yyyy-MM-dd)` |
        | `timestampModification` | Modification timestamp filter | `ge, le` | Modification timestamp is greater / less equals than value.<br>Multiple operator values are allowed and will be connected via logical conjunction (**AND**).<br>e.g. `timestampModification:ge:2016-12-31T23:00:00.123`&#124;<br>`timestampModification:le:2018-01-01T11:00:00.540` | `Date (yyyy-MM-dd)` |

        </details>

        ### Sorting:
        Sort string syntax: `FIELD_NAME:ORDER`  
        `ORDER` can be `asc` or `desc`.  
        Multiple sort criteria are possible.  
        Fields are connected via logical conjunction **AND**.  
        Nodes are sorted by type first, then by sent sort string.  

        <details style="padding-left: 10px">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; outline: none"><strong>Example</strong></summary>

        `name:desc|timestampCreation:asc`  
        Sort by `name` descending **AND** `timestampCreation` ascending.

        </details>

        ### Description:  
        Retrieve all deleted versions of a node.

        ### Precondition:
        User can access parent room and has <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128275; read recycle bin</span> permissions.

        ### Postcondition:
        List of deleted versions of a node is returned.

        ### Further Information:
        The node is identified by three parameters:
        * parent ID
        * name
        * type (file, folder).

        Sort string syntax: `FIELD_NAME:ORDER`  
        `ORDER` can be `asc` or `desc`.  
        Multiple sort criteria are possible.  
        Fields are connected via logical conjunction **AND**.

        <details style="padding-left: 10px">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; outline: none"><strong>Example</strong></summary>

        `expireAt:desc|size:asc`  
        Sort by `expireAt` descending **AND** `size` ascending.

        </details>

        ### Sorting options:
        <details style="padding: 10px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #AAA; border-radius: 5px;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; outline: none"><strong>Expand</strong></summary>

        | `FIELD_NAME` | Description |
        | :--- | :--- |
        | `expireAt` | Expiration date |
        | `accessedAt` | Last access date |
        | `size` | Node size |
        | `classification` | Classification ID:<ul><li>1 - public</li><li>2 - internal</li><li>3 - confidential</li><li>4 - strictly confidential</li></ul> |
        | `createdAt` | Creation date |
        | `createdBy` | Creator first name, last name |
        | `updatedAt` | Last modification date |
        | `updatedBy` | Last modifier first name, last name |
        | `deletedAt` | Deleted date |
        | `deletedBy` | Deleter first name, last name |

        ### Description:  
        Moves nodes (folder, file) to another parent.

        ### Precondition:
        Authenticated user with <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128275; read</span> and <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128275; delete</span> permissions in the source parent and <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128275; create</span> permissions in the target parent node.

        ### Postcondition:
        Nodes are moved to target parent.

        ### Further Information:
        Nodes **MUST** be in same source parent.  
        **Rooms **CANNOT** be moved.**

        Download share id (if exists) gets changed if:
        - node with the same name exists in the target container
        - `resolutionStrategy` is `overwrite`
        - `keepShareLinks` is `true`

        ### Node naming convention:
        * Node (room, folder, file) names are limited to **150** characters.
        * Illegal names:  
        `'CON', 'PRN', 'AUX', 'NUL', 'COM1', 'COM2', 'COM3', 'COM4', 'COM5', 'COM6', 'COM7', 'COM8', 'COM9', 'LPT1', 'LPT2', 'LPT3', 'LPT4', 'LPT5', 'LPT6', 'LPT7', 'LPT8', 'LPT9', (and any of those with an extension)`
        * Illegal characters in names:  
        `'\\', '<','>', ':', '\"', '|', '?', '*', '/', leading '-', trailing '.' `

        ### Description:
        Create a new customer.

        ### Precondition:
        Authentication with `X-Sds-Service-Token` required.  

        ### Postcondition:
        A new customer is created.

        ### Further Information:
        If no company name is set, first letter of the first name separated by dot followed by last name of the first administrator is used (e.g. `J.Doe`).  
        Max quota has to be at least `1 MB` (= `1.048.576 B`).

        If `basic` authentication is enabled, the first administrator will get `basic` authentication by default.  
        To create a first administrator without `basic` authentication it **MUST** be disabled explicitly.  

        Forbidden characters in passwords: [`&`, `'`, `<`, `>`]

        ### Authentication Method Options:
        <details style="padding: 10px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #AAA; border-radius: 5px;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; outline: none"><strong>Expand</strong></summary>

        | Authentication Method | Option Key | Option Value |
        | :--- | :--- | :--- |
        | `basic` / `sql` | `username` | Unique user identifier |
        | `active_directory` | `ad_config_id` (optional) | Active Directory configuration ID |
        |  | `username` | Active Directory username according to authentication setting `userFilter` |
        | `radius` | `username` | RADIUS username |
        | `openid` | `openid_config_id` (optional) | OpenID Connect configuration ID |
        |  | `username` | OpenID Connect username according to authentication setting `mappingClaim` |

        ### Description:  
        Retrieve all system rescue key pairs to allow migrating system-rescue-key-encrypted file keys.

        ### Precondition:
        * Right <span style='padding: 3px; background-color: #F6F7F8; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; display: inline;'>&#128275; change config</span>
        * Existence of own key pair

        ### Postcondition:
        List of key pairs is returned.

        ### Further Information:
        In the case of an algorithm migration of a system rescue key, one should create the new key pair before deleting the old one.  
        This allows re-encrypting file keys with the new key pair, using the old one.  

        This API allows to retrieve both key pairs, in contrast to `GET /settings/keypair`, which only delivers the preferred one.

        ### Auth token restrictions:

        A restriction is a lower bound for a token timeout and defines a duration after which a token is invalidated when it wasn't used.  
        The access/refresh token validity duration of the client is the upper bound. A token is invalidated - in any case - when it has passed.  

        Auth token restrictions are enabled by default.

        * Default access token validity: **2 hours**  
        * Default refresh token validity: **30 days**

        ### Description:
        Finish uploading a file.

        ### Precondition:
        Valid upload token.

        ### Postcondition:
        File created.

        ### Further Information:
        The provided file name might be changed in accordance with the resolution strategy:

        * **autorename**: changes the file name and adds a number to avoid conflicts.
        * **overwrite**: deletes any old file with the same file name.
        * **fail**: returns an error; in this case, another `PUT` request with a different file name may be sent.

        Please ensure that all chunks have been transferred correctly before finishing the upload.

        Download share id (if exists) gets changed if:
        - node with the same name exists in the target container
        - `resolutionStrategy` is `overwrite`
        - `keepShareLinks` is `true`

        Delete user key pair.

        ### Precondition:
        Authenticated user.

        ### Postcondition:
        Key pair is deleted.

        ### Further Information:
        If parameter `version` is not set and two key versions exist, this API deletes version A.      
        If two keys with the same version are set, this API deletes the older one.

        This will also remove all file keys that were encrypted with the user public key.
        If the user had exclusive access to some files, those are removed as well since decrypting them became impossible.
