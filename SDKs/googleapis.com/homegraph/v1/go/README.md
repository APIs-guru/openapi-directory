## SDK Available Operations

### agentUsers

* `HomegraphAgentUsersDelete` - Unlinks the given third-party user from your smart home Action. All data related to this user will be deleted. For more details on how users link their accounts, see [fulfillment and authentication](https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/concepts/fulfillment-authentication). The third-party user's identity is passed in via the `agent_user_id` (see DeleteAgentUserRequest). This request must be authorized using service account credentials from your Actions console project.

### devices

* `HomegraphDevicesQuery` - Gets the current states in Home Graph for the given set of the third-party user's devices. The third-party user's identity is passed in via the `agent_user_id` (see QueryRequest). This request must be authorized using service account credentials from your Actions console project.
* `HomegraphDevicesReportStateAndNotification` - Reports device state and optionally sends device notifications. Called by your smart home Action when the state of a third-party device changes or you need to send a notification about the device. See [Implement Report State](https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/develop/report-state) for more information. This method updates the device state according to its declared [traits](https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/concepts/devices-traits). Publishing a new state value outside of these traits will result in an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error response. The third-party user's identity is passed in via the `agent_user_id` (see ReportStateAndNotificationRequest). This request must be authorized using service account credentials from your Actions console project.
* `HomegraphDevicesRequestSync` - Requests Google to send an `action.devices.SYNC` [intent](https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/reference/intent/sync) to your smart home Action to update device metadata for the given user. The third-party user's identity is passed via the `agent_user_id` (see RequestSyncDevicesRequest). This request must be authorized using service account credentials from your Actions console project.
* `HomegraphDevicesSync` - Gets all the devices associated with the given third-party user. The third-party user's identity is passed in via the `agent_user_id` (see SyncRequest). This request must be authorized using service account credentials from your Actions console project.
