     * healthcareProjectsLocationsDatasetsFhirStoresFhirConditionalUpdate - If a resource is found based on the search criteria specified in the query parameters, updates the entire contents of that resource. Implements the FHIR standard conditional update interaction ([DSTU2](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#2.1.0.10.2), [STU3](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#cond-update), [R4](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#cond-update)). Search terms are provided as query parameters following the same pattern as the search method. If the search criteria identify more than one match, the request returns a `412 Precondition Failed` error. If the search criteria identify zero matches, and the supplied resource body contains an `id`, and the FHIR store has enable_update_create set, creates the resource with the client-specified ID. It is strongly advised not to include or encode any sensitive data such as patient identifiers in client-specified resource IDs. Those IDs are part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud Audit Logs and Pub/Sub notifications. Those IDs can also be contained in reference fields within other resources. If the search criteria identify zero matches, and the supplied resource body does not contain an `id`, the resource is created with a server-assigned ID as per the create method. The request body must contain a JSON-encoded FHIR resource, and the request headers must contain `Content-Type: application/fhir+json`. On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of the updated resource, including the server-assigned version ID. Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. This method requires the`healthcare.fhirStores.searchResources` and `healthcare.fhirResources.update` permissions on the parent FHIR store.

Supports all interactions within a bundle, except search. This method accepts Bundles of type `batch` and `transaction`, processing them according to the batch processing rules ([DSTU2](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#2.1.0.16.1), [STU3](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#2.21.0.17.1), [R4](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#brules)) and transaction processing rules ([DSTU2](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#2.1.0.16.2), [STU3](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#2.21.0.17.2), [R4](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#trules)). The request body must contain a JSON-encoded FHIR `Bundle` resource, and the request headers must contain `Content-Type: application/fhir+json`. For a batch bundle or a successful transaction, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of a `Bundle` resource of type `batch-response` or `transaction-response` containing one entry for each entry in the request, with the outcome of processing the entry. In the case of an error for a transaction bundle, the response body contains a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. This method checks permissions for each request in the bundle. The `executeBundle` permission is required to call this method, but you must also grant sufficient permissions to execute the individual requests in the bundle. For example, if the bundle contains a request to create a FHIR resource, the caller must also have been granted the `healthcare.fhirResources.create` permission. You can use audit logs to view the permissions for `executeBundle` and each request in the bundle. For more information, see [Viewing Cloud Audit logs](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare-api/docs/how-tos/audit-logging).

Supports four methods of search defined by the specification: * `GET [base]?[parameters]` to search across all resources. * `GET [base]/[type]?[parameters]` to search resources of a specified type. * `POST [base]/_search?[parameters]` as an alternate form having the same semantics as the `GET` method across all resources. * `POST [base]/[type]/_search?[parameters]` as an alternate form having the same semantics as the `GET` method for the specified type. The `GET` and `POST` methods do not support compartment searches. The `POST` method does not support `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` search parameters. On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of a `Bundle` resource of type `searchset`, containing the results of the search. Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead.

A list of all search parameters defined by the specification can be found in the FHIR Search Parameter Registry ([STU3](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/searchparameter-registry.html), [R4](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/searchparameter-registry.html)). FHIR search parameters for DSTU2 can be found on each resource's definition page. Supported search modifiers: `:missing`, `:exact`, `:contains`, `:text`, `:in`, `:not-in`, `:above`, `:below`, `:[type]`, `:not`, and `:recurse`. Supported search result parameters: `_sort`, `_count`, `_include`, `_revinclude`, `_summary=text`, `_summary=data`, and `_elements`. The maximum number of search results returned defaults to 100, which can be overridden by the `_count` parameter up to a maximum limit of 1000. If there are additional results, the returned `Bundle` contains a link of `relation` "next", which has a `_page_token` parameter for an opaque pagination token that can be used to retrieve the next page. Resources with a total size larger than 5MB or a field count larger than 50,000 might not be fully searchable as the server might trim its generated search index in those cases. Note: FHIR resources are indexed asynchronously, so there might be a slight delay between the time a resource is created or changes and when the change is reflected in search results.

This method is optimized to load large quantities of data using import semantics that ignore some HL7v2 store configuration options and are not suitable for all use cases. It is primarily intended to load data into an empty HL7v2 store that is not being used by other clients. An existing message will be overwritten if a duplicate message is imported. A duplicate message is a message with the same raw bytes as a message that already exists in this HL7v2 store. When a message is overwritten, its labels will also be overwritten. The import operation is idempotent unless the input data contains multiple valid messages with the same raw bytes but different labels. In that case, after the import completes, the store contains exactly one message with those raw bytes but there is no ordering guarantee on which version of the labels it has. The operation result counters do not count duplicated raw bytes as an error and count one success for each message in the input, which might result in a success count larger than the number of messages in the HL7v2 store. If some messages fail to import, for example due to parsing errors, successfully imported messages are not rolled back. This method returns an Operation that can be used to track the status of the import by calling GetOperation. Immediate fatal errors appear in the error field, errors are also logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)).
