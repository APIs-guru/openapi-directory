## SDK Available Operations

### projects

* `cloudbuild_projects_locations_operations_cancel` - Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
* `cloudbuild_projects_locations_worker_pools_create` - Creates a `WorkerPool` to run the builds, and returns the new worker pool. NOTE: As of now, this method returns an `Operation` that is always complete.
* `cloudbuild_projects_locations_worker_pools_delete` - Deletes a `WorkerPool`. NOTE: As of now, this method returns an `Operation` that is always complete.
* `cloudbuild_projects_locations_worker_pools_get` - Returns details of a `WorkerPool`.
* `cloudbuild_projects_locations_worker_pools_list` - Lists `WorkerPool`s in the given project.
* `cloudbuild_projects_locations_worker_pools_patch` - Updates a `WorkerPool`. NOTE: As of now, this method returns an `Operation` that is always complete.
