## SDK Available Operations

### projects

* `osconfig_projects_locations_instances_inventories_list` - List inventory data for all VM instances in the specified zone.
* `osconfig_projects_locations_instances_os_policy_assignments_reports_list` - List OS policy asssignment reports for all Compute Engine VM instances in the specified zone.
* `osconfig_projects_locations_instances_vulnerability_reports_list` - List vulnerability reports for all VM instances in the specified zone.
* `osconfig_projects_locations_os_policy_assignments_create` - Create an OS policy assignment. This method also creates the first revision of the OS policy assignment. This method returns a long running operation (LRO) that contains the rollout details. The rollout can be cancelled by cancelling the LRO. For more information, see [Method: projects.locations.osPolicyAssignments.operations.cancel](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/osconfig/rest/v1/projects.locations.osPolicyAssignments.operations/cancel).
* `osconfig_projects_locations_os_policy_assignments_list` - List the OS policy assignments under the parent resource. For each OS policy assignment, the latest revision is returned.
* `osconfig_projects_locations_os_policy_assignments_list_revisions` - List the OS policy assignment revisions for a given OS policy assignment.
* `osconfig_projects_patch_deployments_create` - Create an OS Config patch deployment.
* `osconfig_projects_patch_deployments_delete` - Delete an OS Config patch deployment.
* `osconfig_projects_patch_deployments_list` - Get a page of OS Config patch deployments.
* `osconfig_projects_patch_deployments_patch` - Update an OS Config patch deployment.
* `osconfig_projects_patch_deployments_pause` - Change state of patch deployment to "PAUSED". Patch deployment in paused state doesn't generate patch jobs.
* `osconfig_projects_patch_deployments_resume` - Change state of patch deployment back to "ACTIVE". Patch deployment in active state continues to generate patch jobs.
* `osconfig_projects_patch_jobs_cancel` - Cancel a patch job. The patch job must be active. Canceled patch jobs cannot be restarted.
* `osconfig_projects_patch_jobs_execute` - Patch VM instances by creating and running a patch job.
* `osconfig_projects_patch_jobs_get` - Get the patch job. This can be used to track the progress of an ongoing patch job or review the details of completed jobs.
* `osconfig_projects_patch_jobs_instance_details_list` - Get a list of instance details for a given patch job.
* `osconfig_projects_patch_jobs_list` - Get a list of patch jobs.
