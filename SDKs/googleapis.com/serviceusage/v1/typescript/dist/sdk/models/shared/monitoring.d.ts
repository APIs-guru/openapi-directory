 * Monitoring configuration of the service. The example below shows how to configure monitored resources and metrics for monitoring. In the example, a monitored resource and two metrics are defined. The `library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count` metric is sent to both producer and consumer projects, whereas the `library.googleapis.com/book/num_overdue` metric is only sent to the consumer project. monitored_resources: - type: library.googleapis.com/Branch display_name: "Library Branch" description: "A branch of a library." launch_stage: GA labels: - key: resource_container description: "The Cloud container (ie. project id) for the Branch." - key: location description: "The location of the library branch." - key: branch_id description: "The id of the branch." metrics: - name: library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count display_name: "Books Returned" description: "The count of books that have been returned." launch_stage: GA metric_kind: DELTA value_type: INT64 unit: "1" labels: - key: customer_id description: "The id of the customer." - name: library.googleapis.com/book/num_overdue display_name: "Books Overdue" description: "The current number of overdue books." launch_stage: GA metric_kind: GAUGE value_type: INT64 unit: "1" labels: - key: customer_id description: "The id of the customer." monitoring: producer_destinations: - monitored_resource: library.googleapis.com/Branch metrics: - library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count consumer_destinations: - monitored_resource: library.googleapis.com/Branch metrics: - library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count - library.googleapis.com/book/num_overdue
