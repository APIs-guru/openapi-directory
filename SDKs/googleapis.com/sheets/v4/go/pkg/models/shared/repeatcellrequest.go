// RepeatCellRequest
// Updates all cells in the range to the values in the given Cell object. Only the fields listed in the fields field are updated; others are unchanged. If writing a cell with a formula, the formula's ranges will automatically increment for each field in the range. For example, if writing a cell with formula `=A1` into range B2:C4, B2 would be `=A1`, B3 would be `=A2`, B4 would be `=A3`, C2 would be `=B1`, C3 would be `=B2`, C4 would be `=B3`. To keep the formula's ranges static, use the `$` indicator. For example, use the formula `=$A$1` to prevent both the row and the column from incrementing.
type RepeatCellRequest struct {
	Cell   *CellData  `json:"cell,omitempty"`
	Fields *string    `json:"fields,omitempty"`
	Range  *GridRange `json:"range,omitempty"`
