It must be called before the operation is executed. If feasible, the client should cache the check results and reuse them for 60 seconds. In case of any server errors, the client should rely on the cached results for much longer time to avoid outage.

Clients should carefully choose the aggregation time window to avoid data loss risk more than 0.01% for business and compliance reasons.
