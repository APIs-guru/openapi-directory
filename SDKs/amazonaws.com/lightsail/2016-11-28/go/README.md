## SDK Available Operations

### SDK SDK

* `AllocateStaticIP` - Allocates a static IP address.
* `AttachCertificateToDistribution` - <p>Attaches an SSL/TLS certificate to your Amazon Lightsail content delivery network (CDN) distribution.</p> <p>After the certificate is attached, your distribution accepts HTTPS traffic for all of the domains that are associated with the certificate.</p> <p>Use the <code>CreateCertificate</code> action to create a certificate that you can attach to your distribution.</p> <important> <p>Only certificates created in the <code>us-east-1</code> AWS Region can be attached to Lightsail distributions. Lightsail distributions are global resources that can reference an origin in any AWS Region, and distribute its content globally. However, all distributions are located in the <code>us-east-1</code> Region.</p> </important>
* `AttachDisk` - <p>Attaches a block storage disk to a running or stopped Lightsail instance and exposes it to the instance with the specified disk name.</p> <p>The <code>attach disk</code> operation supports tag-based access control via resource tags applied to the resource identified by <code>disk name</code>. For more information, see the <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-controlling-access-using-tags">Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide</a>.</p>
* `AttachInstancesToLoadBalancer` - <p>Attaches one or more Lightsail instances to a load balancer.</p> <p>After some time, the instances are attached to the load balancer and the health check status is available.</p> <p>The <code>attach instances to load balancer</code> operation supports tag-based access control via resource tags applied to the resource identified by <code>load balancer name</code>. For more information, see the <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-controlling-access-using-tags">Lightsail Developer Guide</a>.</p>
* `AttachLoadBalancerTLSCertificate` - <p>Attaches a Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate to your load balancer. TLS is just an updated, more secure version of Secure Socket Layer (SSL).</p> <p>Once you create and validate your certificate, you can attach it to your load balancer. You can also use this API to rotate the certificates on your account. Use the <code>AttachLoadBalancerTlsCertificate</code> action with the non-attached certificate, and it will replace the existing one and become the attached certificate.</p> <p>The <code>AttachLoadBalancerTlsCertificate</code> operation supports tag-based access control via resource tags applied to the resource identified by <code>load balancer name</code>. For more information, see the <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-controlling-access-using-tags">Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide</a>.</p>
* `AttachStaticIP` - Attaches a static IP address to a specific Amazon Lightsail instance.
* `CloseInstancePublicPorts` - <p>Closes ports for a specific Amazon Lightsail instance.</p> <p>The <code>CloseInstancePublicPorts</code> action supports tag-based access control via resource tags applied to the resource identified by <code>instanceName</code>. For more information, see the <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-controlling-access-using-tags">Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide</a>.</p>
* `CopySnapshot` - <p>Copies a manual snapshot of an instance or disk as another manual snapshot, or copies an automatic snapshot of an instance or disk as a manual snapshot. This operation can also be used to copy a manual or automatic snapshot of an instance or a disk from one AWS Region to another in Amazon Lightsail.</p> <p>When copying a <i>manual snapshot</i>, be sure to define the <code>source region</code>, <code>source snapshot name</code>, and <code>target snapshot name</code> parameters.</p> <p>When copying an <i>automatic snapshot</i>, be sure to define the <code>source region</code>, <code>source resource name</code>, <code>target snapshot name</code>, and either the <code>restore date</code> or the <code>use latest restorable auto snapshot</code> parameters.</p>
* `CreateBucket` - <p>Creates an Amazon Lightsail bucket.</p> <p>A bucket is a cloud storage resource available in the Lightsail object storage service. Use buckets to store objects such as data and its descriptive metadata. For more information about buckets, see <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/buckets-in-amazon-lightsail">Buckets in Amazon Lightsail</a> in the <i>Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide</i>.</p>
* `CreateBucketAccessKey` - <p>Creates a new access key for the specified Amazon Lightsail bucket. Access keys consist of an access key ID and corresponding secret access key.</p> <p>Access keys grant full programmatic access to the specified bucket and its objects. You can have a maximum of two access keys per bucket. Use the <a>GetBucketAccessKeys</a> action to get a list of current access keys for a specific bucket. For more information about access keys, see <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-creating-bucket-access-keys">Creating access keys for a bucket in Amazon Lightsail</a> in the <i>Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide</i>.</p> <important> <p>The <code>secretAccessKey</code> value is returned only in response to the <code>CreateBucketAccessKey</code> action. You can get a secret access key only when you first create an access key; you cannot get the secret access key later. If you lose the secret access key, you must create a new access key.</p> </important>
* `CreateCertificate` - <p>Creates an SSL/TLS certificate for an Amazon Lightsail content delivery network (CDN) distribution and a container service.</p> <p>After the certificate is valid, use the <code>AttachCertificateToDistribution</code> action to use the certificate and its domains with your distribution. Or use the <code>UpdateContainerService</code> action to use the certificate and its domains with your container service.</p> <important> <p>Only certificates created in the <code>us-east-1</code> AWS Region can be attached to Lightsail distributions. Lightsail distributions are global resources that can reference an origin in any AWS Region, and distribute its content globally. However, all distributions are located in the <code>us-east-1</code> Region.</p> </important>
* `CreateCloudFormationStack` - <p>Creates an AWS CloudFormation stack, which creates a new Amazon EC2 instance from an exported Amazon Lightsail snapshot. This operation results in a CloudFormation stack record that can be used to track the AWS CloudFormation stack created. Use the <code>get cloud formation stack records</code> operation to get a list of the CloudFormation stacks created.</p> <important> <p>Wait until after your new Amazon EC2 instance is created before running the <code>create cloud formation stack</code> operation again with the same export snapshot record.</p> </important>
* `CreateContactMethod` - <p>Creates an email or SMS text message contact method.</p> <p>A contact method is used to send you notifications about your Amazon Lightsail resources. You can add one email address and one mobile phone number contact method in each AWS Region. However, SMS text messaging is not supported in some AWS Regions, and SMS text messages cannot be sent to some countries/regions. For more information, see <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-notifications">Notifications in Amazon Lightsail</a>.</p>
* `CreateContainerService` - <p>Creates an Amazon Lightsail container service.</p> <p>A Lightsail container service is a compute resource to which you can deploy containers. For more information, see <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-container-services">Container services in Amazon Lightsail</a> in the <i>Lightsail Dev Guide</i>.</p>
* `CreateContainerServiceDeployment` - <p>Creates a deployment for your Amazon Lightsail container service.</p> <p>A deployment specifies the containers that will be launched on the container service and their settings, such as the ports to open, the environment variables to apply, and the launch command to run. It also specifies the container that will serve as the public endpoint of the deployment and its settings, such as the HTTP or HTTPS port to use, and the health check configuration.</p> <p>You can deploy containers to your container service using container images from a public registry like Docker Hub, or from your local machine. For more information, see <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-creating-container-images">Creating container images for your Amazon Lightsail container services</a> in the <i>Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide</i>.</p>
* `CreateContainerServiceRegistryLogin` - <p>Creates a temporary set of log in credentials that you can use to log in to the Docker process on your local machine. After you're logged in, you can use the native Docker commands to push your local container images to the container image registry of your Amazon Lightsail account so that you can use them with your Lightsail container service. The log in credentials expire 12 hours after they are created, at which point you will need to create a new set of log in credentials.</p> <note> <p>You can only push container images to the container service registry of your Lightsail account. You cannot pull container images or perform any other container image management actions on the container service registry.</p> </note> <p>After you push your container images to the container image registry of your Lightsail account, use the <code>RegisterContainerImage</code> action to register the pushed images to a specific Lightsail container service.</p> <note> <p>This action is not required if you install and use the Lightsail Control (lightsailctl) plugin to push container images to your Lightsail container service. For more information, see <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-pushing-container-images">Pushing and managing container images on your Amazon Lightsail container services</a> in the <i>Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide</i>.</p> </note>
* `CreateDisk` - <p>Creates a block storage disk that can be attached to an Amazon Lightsail instance in the same Availability Zone (e.g., <code>us-east-2a</code>).</p> <p>The <code>create disk</code> operation supports tag-based access control via request tags. For more information, see the <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-controlling-access-using-tags">Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide</a>.</p>
* `CreateDiskFromSnapshot` - <p>Creates a block storage disk from a manual or automatic snapshot of a disk. The resulting disk can be attached to an Amazon Lightsail instance in the same Availability Zone (e.g., <code>us-east-2a</code>).</p> <p>The <code>create disk from snapshot</code> operation supports tag-based access control via request tags and resource tags applied to the resource identified by <code>disk snapshot name</code>. For more information, see the <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-controlling-access-using-tags">Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide</a>.</p>
* `CreateDiskSnapshot` - <p>Creates a snapshot of a block storage disk. You can use snapshots for backups, to make copies of disks, and to save data before shutting down a Lightsail instance.</p> <p>You can take a snapshot of an attached disk that is in use; however, snapshots only capture data that has been written to your disk at the time the snapshot command is issued. This may exclude any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating system. If you can pause any file systems on the disk long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete. Nevertheless, if you cannot pause all file writes to the disk, you should unmount the disk from within the Lightsail instance, issue the create disk snapshot command, and then remount the disk to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount and use your disk while the snapshot status is pending.</p> <p>You can also use this operation to create a snapshot of an instance's system volume. You might want to do this, for example, to recover data from the system volume of a botched instance or to create a backup of the system volume like you would for a block storage disk. To create a snapshot of a system volume, just define the <code>instance name</code> parameter when issuing the snapshot command, and a snapshot of the defined instance's system volume will be created. After the snapshot is available, you can create a block storage disk from the snapshot and attach it to a running instance to access the data on the disk.</p> <p>The <code>create disk snapshot</code> operation supports tag-based access control via request tags. For more information, see the <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-controlling-access-using-tags">Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide</a>.</p>
