### SDK SDK

* `AcceptAdministratorInvitation` - <p>Accepts the invitation to be a member account and be monitored by the Security Hub administrator account that the invitation was sent from.</p> <p>This operation is only used by member accounts that are not added through Organizations.</p> <p>When the member account accepts the invitation, permission is granted to the administrator account to view findings generated in the member account.</p>
* `AcceptInvitation` - <p>This method is deprecated. Instead, use <code>AcceptAdministratorInvitation</code>.</p> <p>The Security Hub console continues to use <code>AcceptInvitation</code>. It will eventually change to use <code>AcceptAdministratorInvitation</code>. Any IAM policies that specifically control access to this function must continue to use <code>AcceptInvitation</code>. You should also add <code>AcceptAdministratorInvitation</code> to your policies to ensure that the correct permissions are in place after the console begins to use <code>AcceptAdministratorInvitation</code>.</p> <p>Accepts the invitation to be a member account and be monitored by the Security Hub administrator account that the invitation was sent from.</p> <p>This operation is only used by member accounts that are not added through Organizations.</p> <p>When the member account accepts the invitation, permission is granted to the administrator account to view findings generated in the member account.</p>
* `BatchDisableStandards` - <p>Disables the standards specified by the provided <code>StandardsSubscriptionArns</code>.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-standards.html">Security Standards</a> section of the <i>Security Hub User Guide</i>.</p>
* `BatchEnableStandards` - <p>Enables the standards specified by the provided <code>StandardsArn</code>. To obtain the ARN for a standard, use the <code>DescribeStandards</code> operation.</p> <p>For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-standards.html">Security Standards</a> section of the <i>Security Hub User Guide</i>.</p>
* `BatchImportFindings` - <p>Imports security findings generated from an integrated product into Security Hub. This action is requested by the integrated product to import its findings into Security Hub.</p> <p>The maximum allowed size for a finding is 240 Kb. An error is returned for any finding larger than 240 Kb.</p> <p>After a finding is created, <code>BatchImportFindings</code> cannot be used to update the following finding fields and objects, which Security Hub customers use to manage their investigation workflow.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>Note</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>UserDefinedFields</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>VerificationState</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Workflow</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>Finding providers also should not use <code>BatchImportFindings</code> to update the following attributes.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>Confidence</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Criticality</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>RelatedFindings</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Severity</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Types</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>Instead, finding providers use <code>FindingProviderFields</code> to provide values for these attributes.</p>
* `BatchUpdateFindings` - <p>Used by Security Hub customers to update information about their investigation into a finding. Requested by administrator accounts or member accounts. Administrator accounts can update findings for their account and their member accounts. Member accounts can update findings for their account.</p> <p>Updates from <code>BatchUpdateFindings</code> do not affect the value of <code>UpdatedAt</code> for a finding.</p> <p>Administrator and member accounts can use <code>BatchUpdateFindings</code> to update the following finding fields and objects.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>Confidence</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Criticality</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Note</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>RelatedFindings</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Severity</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Types</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>UserDefinedFields</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>VerificationState</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Workflow</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>You can configure IAM policies to restrict access to fields and field values. For example, you might not want member accounts to be able to suppress findings or change the finding severity. See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/finding-update-batchupdatefindings.html#batchupdatefindings-configure-access">Configuring access to BatchUpdateFindings</a> in the <i>Security Hub User Guide</i>.</p>
* `CreateActionTarget` - <p>Creates a custom action target in Security Hub.</p> <p>You can use custom actions on findings and insights in Security Hub to trigger target actions in Amazon CloudWatch Events.</p>
* `CreateInsight` - <p>Creates a custom insight in Security Hub. An insight is a consolidation of findings that relate to a security issue that requires attention or remediation.</p> <p>To group the related findings in the insight, use the <code>GroupByAttribute</code>.</p>
* `CreateMembers` - <p>Creates a member association in Security Hub between the specified accounts and the account used to make the request, which is the administrator account. If you are integrated with Organizations, then the administrator account is designated by the organization management account.</p> <p> <code>CreateMembers</code> is always used to add accounts that are not organization members.</p> <p>For accounts that are managed using Organizations, <code>CreateMembers</code> is only used in the following cases:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Security Hub is not configured to automatically add new organization accounts.</p> </li> <li> <p>The account was disassociated or deleted in Security Hub.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This action can only be used by an account that has Security Hub enabled. To enable Security Hub, you can use the <code>EnableSecurityHub</code> operation.</p> <p>For accounts that are not organization members, you create the account association and then send an invitation to the member account. To send the invitation, you use the <code>InviteMembers</code> operation. If the account owner accepts the invitation, the account becomes a member account in Security Hub.</p> <p>Accounts that are managed using Organizations do not receive an invitation. They automatically become a member account in Security Hub, and Security Hub is automatically enabled for those accounts. Note that Security Hub cannot be enabled automatically for the organization management account. The organization management account must enable Security Hub before the administrator account enables it as a member account.</p> <p>A permissions policy is added that permits the administrator account to view the findings generated in the member account. When Security Hub is enabled in a member account, the member account findings are also visible to the administrator account. </p> <p>To remove the association between the administrator and member accounts, use the <code>DisassociateFromMasterAccount</code> or <code>DisassociateMembers</code> operation.</p>
* `DeclineInvitations` - <p>Declines invitations to become a member account.</p> <p>This operation is only used by accounts that are not part of an organization. Organization accounts do not receive invitations.</p>

* `DescribeStandards` - <p>Returns a list of the available standards in Security Hub.</p> <p>For each standard, the results include the standard ARN, the name, and a description. </p>

Any standards that were enabled are disabled, and your administrator and member account associations are removed.</p> <p>If you want to save your existing findings, you must export them before you disable Security Hub.</p>
* `DisassociateFromAdministratorAccount` - <p>Disassociates the current Security Hub member account from the associated administrator account.</p> <p>This operation is only used by accounts that are not part of an organization.
