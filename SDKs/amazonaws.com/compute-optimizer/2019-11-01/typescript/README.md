### SDK SDK

* `describeRecommendationExportJobs` - <p>Describes recommendation export jobs created in the last seven days.</p> <p>Use the <a>ExportAutoScalingGroupRecommendations</a> or <a>ExportEC2InstanceRecommendations</a> actions to request an export of your recommendations. Then use the <a>DescribeRecommendationExportJobs</a> action to view your export jobs.</p>
* `exportAutoScalingGroupRecommendations` - <p>Exports optimization recommendations for Auto Scaling groups.</p> <p>Recommendations are exported in a comma-separated values (.csv) file, and its metadata in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) (.json) file, to an existing Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that you specify. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/exporting-recommendations.html">Exporting Recommendations</a> in the <i>Compute Optimizer User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can have only one Auto Scaling group export job in progress per Amazon Web Services Region.</p>
* `exportEbsVolumeRecommendations` - <p>Exports optimization recommendations for Amazon EBS volumes.</p> <p>Recommendations are exported in a comma-separated values (.csv) file, and its metadata in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) (.json) file, to an existing Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that you specify. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/exporting-recommendations.html">Exporting Recommendations</a> in the <i>Compute Optimizer User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can have only one Amazon EBS volume export job in progress per Amazon Web Services Region.</p>
* `exportEc2InstanceRecommendations` - <p>Exports optimization recommendations for Amazon EC2 instances.</p> <p>Recommendations are exported in a comma-separated values (.csv) file, and its metadata in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) (.json) file, to an existing Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that you specify. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/exporting-recommendations.html">Exporting Recommendations</a> in the <i>Compute Optimizer User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can have only one Amazon EC2 instance export job in progress per Amazon Web Services Region.</p>
* `exportLambdaFunctionRecommendations` - <p>Exports optimization recommendations for Lambda functions.</p> <p>Recommendations are exported in a comma-separated values (.csv) file, and its metadata in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) (.json) file, to an existing Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that you specify.

* `getEc2RecommendationProjectedMetrics` - <p>Returns the projected utilization metrics of Amazon EC2 instance recommendations.</p> <note> <p>The <code>Cpu</code> and <code>Memory</code> metrics are the only projected utilization metrics returned when you run this action. Additionally, the <code>Memory</code> metric is returned only for resources that have the unified CloudWatch agent installed on them. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/metrics.html#cw-agent">Enabling Memory Utilization with the CloudWatch Agent</a>.</p> </note>
* `getEnrollmentStatus` - <p>Returns the enrollment (opt in) status of an account to the Compute Optimizer service.</p> <p>If the account is the management account of an organization, this action also confirms the enrollment status of member accounts of the organization.
