// ProjectedMetric
// <p>Describes a projected utilization metric of a recommendation option, such as an Amazon EC2 instance. This represents the projected utilization of a recommendation option had you used that resource during the analyzed period.</p> <p>Compare the utilization metric data of your resource against its projected utilization metric data to determine the performance difference between your current resource and the recommended option.</p> <note> <p>The <code>Cpu</code> and <code>Memory</code> metrics are the only projected utilization metrics returned when you run the <a>GetEC2RecommendationProjectedMetrics</a> action. Additionally, the <code>Memory</code> metric is returned only for resources that have the unified CloudWatch agent installed on them. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/metrics.html#cw-agent">Enabling Memory Utilization with the CloudWatch Agent</a>.</p> </note>
