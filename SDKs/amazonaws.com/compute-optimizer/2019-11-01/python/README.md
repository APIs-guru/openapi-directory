### SDK SDK

* `describe_recommendation_export_jobs` - <p>Describes recommendation export jobs created in the last seven days.</p> <p>Use the <a>ExportAutoScalingGroupRecommendations</a> or <a>ExportEC2InstanceRecommendations</a> actions to request an export of your recommendations. Then use the <a>DescribeRecommendationExportJobs</a> action to view your export jobs.</p>
* `export_auto_scaling_group_recommendations` - <p>Exports optimization recommendations for Auto Scaling groups.</p> <p>Recommendations are exported in a comma-separated values (.csv) file, and its metadata in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) (.json) file, to an existing Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that you specify. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/exporting-recommendations.html">Exporting Recommendations</a> in the <i>Compute Optimizer User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can have only one Auto Scaling group export job in progress per Amazon Web Services Region.</p>
