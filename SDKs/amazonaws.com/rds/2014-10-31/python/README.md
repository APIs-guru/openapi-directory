* `get_add_role_to_db_instance` - <p>Associates an Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with a DB instance.</p> <note> <p>To add a role to a DB instance, the status of the DB instance must be <code>available</code>.</p> </note>
* `get_add_source_identifier_to_subscription` - Adds a source identifier to an existing RDS event notification subscription.
* `get_apply_pending_maintenance_action` - Applies a pending maintenance action to a resource (for example, to a DB instance).
* `get_authorize_db_security_group_ingress` - <p>Enables ingress to a DBSecurityGroup using one of two forms of authorization. First, EC2 or VPC security groups can be added to the DBSecurityGroup if the application using the database is running on EC2 or VPC instances. Second, IP ranges are available if the application accessing your database is running on the Internet. Required parameters for this API are one of CIDR range, EC2SecurityGroupId for VPC, or (EC2SecurityGroupOwnerId and either EC2SecurityGroupName or EC2SecurityGroupId for non-VPC).</p> <note> <p>You can't authorize ingress from an EC2 security group in one Amazon Web Services Region to an Amazon RDS DB instance in another. You can't authorize ingress from a VPC security group in one VPC to an Amazon RDS DB instance in another.</p> </note> <p>For an overview of CIDR ranges, go to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing">Wikipedia Tutorial</a>. </p>

* `get_create_custom_availability_zone` - <p>Creates a custom Availability Zone (AZ).</p> <p>A custom AZ is an on-premises AZ that is integrated with a VMware vSphere cluster.</p> <p>For more information about RDS on VMware, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/RDSonVMwareUserGuide/rds-on-vmware.html"> RDS on VMware User Guide.</a> </p>
* `get_create_global_cluster` - <p> Creates an Aurora global database spread across multiple Amazon Web Services Regions. The global database contains a single primary cluster with read-write capability, and a read-only secondary cluster that receives data from the primary cluster through high-speed replication performed by the Aurora storage subsystem. </p> <p> You can create a global database that is initially empty, and then add a primary cluster and a secondary cluster to it. Or you can specify an existing Aurora cluster during the create operation, and this cluster becomes the primary cluster of the global database. </p> <note> <p>This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.</p> </note>
* `get_delete_custom_availability_zone` - <p>Deletes a custom Availability Zone (AZ).</p> <p>A custom AZ is an on-premises AZ that is integrated with a VMware vSphere cluster.</p> <p>For more information about RDS on VMware, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/RDSonVMwareUserGuide/rds-on-vmware.html"> RDS on VMware User Guide.</a> </p>

When you delete a DB instance, all automated backups for that instance are deleted and can't be recovered. Manual DB snapshots of the DB instance to be deleted by <code>DeleteDBInstance</code> are not deleted.</p> <p> If you request a final DB snapshot the status of the Amazon RDS DB instance is <code>deleting</code> until the DB snapshot is created. The API action <code>DescribeDBInstance</code> is used to monitor the status of this operation. The action can't be canceled or reverted once submitted. </p> <p>When a DB instance is in a failure state and has a status of <code>failed</code>, <code>incompatible-restore</code>, or <code>incompatible-network</code>, you can only delete it when you skip creation of the final snapshot with the <code>SkipFinalSnapshot</code> parameter.</p> <p>If the specified DB instance is part of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster, you can't delete the DB instance if both of the following conditions are true:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The DB cluster is a read replica of another Amazon Aurora DB cluster.</p> </li> <li> <p>The DB instance is the only instance in the DB cluster.</p> </li> </ul> <p>To delete a DB instance in this case, first call the <code>PromoteReadReplicaDBCluster</code> API action to promote the DB cluster so it's no longer a read replica. After the promotion completes, then call the <code>DeleteDBInstance</code> API action to delete the final instance in the DB cluster.</p>

* `get_delete_option_group` - Deletes an existing option group.
* `get_deregister_db_proxy_targets` - Remove the association between one or more <code>DBProxyTarget</code> data structures and a <code>DBProxyTargetGroup</code>.
* `get_describe_account_attributes` - <p>Lists all of the attributes for a customer account. The attributes include Amazon RDS quotas for the account, such as the number of DB instances allowed. The description for a quota includes the quota name, current usage toward that quota, and the quota's maximum value.</p> <p>This command doesn't take any parameters.</p>
* `get_describe_db_cluster_snapshot_attributes` - <p>Returns a list of DB cluster snapshot attribute names and values for a manual DB cluster snapshot.</p> <p>When sharing snapshots with other Amazon Web Services accounts, <code>DescribeDBClusterSnapshotAttributes</code> returns the <code>restore</code> attribute and a list of IDs for the Amazon Web Services accounts that are authorized to copy or restore the manual DB cluster snapshot. If <code>all</code> is included in the list of values for the <code>restore</code> attribute, then the manual DB cluster snapshot is public and can be copied or restored by all Amazon Web Services accounts.</p> <p>To add or remove access for an Amazon Web Services account to copy or restore a manual DB cluster snapshot, or to make the manual DB cluster snapshot public or private, use the <code>ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute</code> API action.</p> <note> <p>This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.</p> </note>
* `get_describe_db_snapshot_attributes` - <p>Returns a list of DB snapshot attribute names and values for a manual DB snapshot.</p> <p>When sharing snapshots with other Amazon Web Services accounts, <code>DescribeDBSnapshotAttributes</code> returns the <code>restore</code> attribute and a list of IDs for the Amazon Web Services accounts that are authorized to copy or restore the manual DB snapshot. If <code>all</code> is included in the list of values for the <code>restore</code> attribute, then the manual DB snapshot is public and can be copied or restored by all Amazon Web Services accounts.</p> <p>To add or remove access for an Amazon Web Services account to copy or restore a manual DB snapshot, or to make the manual DB snapshot public or private, use the <code>ModifyDBSnapshotAttribute</code> API action.</p>
* `get_describe_valid_db_instance_modifications` - You can call <code>DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications</code> to learn what modifications you can make to your DB instance. You can use this information when you call <code>ModifyDBInstance</code>. 
* `get_download_db_log_file_portion` - Downloads all or a portion of the specified log file, up to 1 MB in size.
* `get_failover_db_cluster` - <p>Forces a failover for a DB cluster.</p> <p>A failover for a DB cluster promotes one of the Aurora Replicas (read-only instances) in the DB cluster to be the primary instance (the cluster writer).</p> <p>Amazon Aurora will automatically fail over to an Aurora Replica, if one exists, when the primary instance fails. You can force a failover when you want to simulate a failure of a primary instance for testing. Because each instance in a DB cluster has its own endpoint address, you will need to clean up and re-establish any existing connections that use those endpoint addresses when the failover is complete.</p> <p>For more information on Amazon Aurora, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html"> What Is Amazon Aurora?</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide.</i> </p> <note> <p>This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.</p> </note>
* `get_failover_global_cluster` - <p>Initiates the failover process for an Aurora global database (<a>GlobalCluster</a>).</p> <p>A failover for an Aurora global database promotes one of secondary read-only DB clusters to be the primary DB cluster and demotes the primary DB cluster to being a secondary (read-only) DB cluster. In other words, the role of the current primary DB cluster and the selected (target) DB cluster are switched. The selected secondary DB cluster assumes full read/write capabilities for the Aurora global database.</p> <p>For more information about failing over an Amazon Aurora global database, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.html#aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.managed-failover">Managed planned failover for Amazon Aurora global databases</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide.</i> </p> <note> <p>This action applies to <a>GlobalCluster</a> (Aurora global databases) only. Use this action only on healthy Aurora global databases with running Aurora DB clusters and no Region-wide outages, to test disaster recovery scenarios or to reconfigure your Aurora global database topology. </p> </note>
* `get_import_installation_media` - Imports the installation media for a DB engine that requires an on-premises customer provided license, such as SQL Server.
* `get_modify_certificates` - <p>Override the system-default Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificate for Amazon RDS for new DB instances temporarily, or remove the override.</p> <p>By using this operation, you can specify an RDS-approved SSL/TLS certificate for new DB instances that is different from the default certificate provided by RDS. You can also use this operation to remove the override, so that new DB instances use the default certificate provided by RDS.</p> <p>You might need to override the default certificate in the following situations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You already migrated your applications to support the latest certificate authority (CA) certificate, but the new CA certificate is not yet the RDS default CA certificate for the specified Amazon Web Services Region.</p> </li> <li> <p>RDS has already moved to a new default CA certificate for the specified Amazon Web Services Region, but you are still in the process of supporting the new CA certificate. In this case, you temporarily need additional time to finish your application changes.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about rotating your SSL/TLS certificate for RDS DB engines, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html"> Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information about rotating your SSL/TLS certificate for Aurora DB engines, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html"> Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p>
* `get_modify_current_db_cluster_capacity` - <p>Set the capacity of an Aurora Serverless DB cluster to a specific value.</p> <p>Aurora Serverless scales seamlessly based on the workload on the DB cluster. In some cases, the capacity might not scale fast enough to meet a sudden change in workload, such as a large number of new transactions. Call <code>ModifyCurrentDBClusterCapacity</code> to set the capacity explicitly.</p> <p>After this call sets the DB cluster capacity, Aurora Serverless can automatically scale the DB cluster based on the cooldown period for scaling up and the cooldown period for scaling down.</p> <p>For more information about Aurora Serverless, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.html">Using Amazon Aurora Serverless</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p> <important> <p>If you call <code>ModifyCurrentDBClusterCapacity</code> with the default <code>TimeoutAction</code>, connections that prevent Aurora Serverless from finding a scaling point might be dropped. For more information about scaling points, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.how-it-works.html#aurora-serverless.how-it-works.auto-scaling"> Autoscaling for Aurora Serverless</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p> </important> <note> <p>This action only applies to Aurora Serverless DB clusters.</p> </note>

* `get_modify_db_cluster_snapshot_attribute` - <p>Adds an attribute and values to, or removes an attribute and values from, a manual DB cluster snapshot.</p> <p>To share a manual DB cluster snapshot with other Amazon Web Services accounts, specify <code>restore</code> as the <code>AttributeName</code> and use the <code>ValuesToAdd</code> parameter to add a list of IDs of the Amazon Web Services accounts that are authorized to restore the manual DB cluster snapshot. Use the value <code>all</code> to make the manual DB cluster snapshot public, which means that it can be copied or restored by all Amazon Web Services accounts.</p> <note> <p>Don't add the <code>all</code> value for any manual DB cluster snapshots that contain private information that you don't want available to all Amazon Web Services accounts.</p> </note> <p>If a manual DB cluster snapshot is encrypted, it can be shared, but only by specifying a list of authorized Amazon Web Services account IDs for the <code>ValuesToAdd</code> parameter. You can't use <code>all</code> as a value for that parameter in this case.</p> <p>To view which Amazon Web Services accounts have access to copy or restore a manual DB cluster snapshot, or whether a manual DB cluster snapshot is public or private, use the <a>DescribeDBClusterSnapshotAttributes</a> API action. The accounts are returned as values for the <code>restore</code> attribute.</p> <note> <p>This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.</p> </note>

* `post_copy_db_cluster_snapshot` - <p>Copies a snapshot of a DB cluster.</p> <p>To copy a DB cluster snapshot from a shared manual DB cluster snapshot, <code>SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the shared DB cluster snapshot.</p> <p>You can copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Services Region. In that case, the Amazon Web Services Region where you call the <code>CopyDBClusterSnapshot</code> action is the destination Amazon Web Services Region for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied to. To copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Services Region, you must provide the following values:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>KmsKeyId</code> - The Amazon Web Services Key Management System (Amazon Web Services KMS) key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>PreSignedUrl</code> - A URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the <code>CopyDBClusterSnapshot</code> action to be called in the source Amazon Web Services Region where the DB cluster snapshot is copied from. The pre-signed URL must be a valid request for the <code>CopyDBClusterSnapshot</code> API action that can be executed in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied.</p> <p>The pre-signed URL request must contain the following parameter values:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>KmsKeyId</code> - The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for the customer master key (CMK) to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same identifier for both the <code>CopyDBClusterSnapshot</code> action that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the action contained in the pre-signed URL.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DestinationRegion</code> - The name of the Amazon Web Services Region that the DB cluster snapshot is to be created in.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your <code>SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> looks like the following example: <code>arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster-snapshot:aurora-cluster1-snapshot-20161115</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html"> Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html"> Signature Version 4 Signing Process</a>.</p> <note> <p>If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify <code>SourceRegion</code> (or <code>--source-region</code> for the CLI) instead of specifying <code>PreSignedUrl</code> manually. Specifying <code>SourceRegion</code> autogenerates a pre-signed URL that is a valid request for the operation that can be executed in the source Amazon Web Services Region.</p> </note> </li> <li> <p> <code>TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> - The identifier for the new copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the ARN format for the source Amazon Web Services Region and is the same value as the <code>SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> in the pre-signed URL. </p> </li> </ul> <p>To cancel the copy operation once it is in progress, delete the target DB cluster snapshot identified by <code>TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> while that DB cluster snapshot is in "copying" status.</p> <p>For more information on copying encrypted DB cluster snapshots from one Amazon Web Services Region to another, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_CopySnapshot.html"> Copying a Snapshot</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide.</i> </p> <p>For more information on Amazon Aurora, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html"> What Is Amazon Aurora?</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide.</i> </p> <note> <p>This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.</p> </note>
* `post_copy_db_parameter_group` - Copies the specified DB parameter group.
* `post_copy_db_snapshot` - <p>Copies the specified DB snapshot. The source DB snapshot must be in the <code>available</code> state.</p> <p>You can copy a snapshot from one Amazon Web Services Region to another. In that case, the Amazon Web Services Region where you call the <code>CopyDBSnapshot</code> action is the destination Amazon Web Services Region for the DB snapshot copy. </p> <p>For more information about copying snapshots, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CopySnapshot.html#USER_CopyDBSnapshot">Copying a DB Snapshot</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide.</i> </p>
* `post_copy_option_group` - Copies the specified option group.

* `post_create_db_cluster_parameter_group` - <p>Creates a new DB cluster parameter group.</p> <p>Parameters in a DB cluster parameter group apply to all of the instances in a DB cluster.</p> <p> A DB cluster parameter group is initially created with the default parameters for the database engine used by instances in the DB cluster. To provide custom values for any of the parameters, you must modify the group after creating it using <code>ModifyDBClusterParameterGroup</code>. Once you've created a DB cluster parameter group, you need to associate it with your DB cluster using <code>ModifyDBCluster</code>. When you associate a new DB cluster parameter group with a running DB cluster, you need to reboot the DB instances in the DB cluster without failover for the new DB cluster parameter group and associated settings to take effect. </p> <important> <p>After you create a DB cluster parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB cluster that uses that DB cluster parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon RDS to fully complete the create action before the DB cluster parameter group is used as the default for a new DB cluster. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB cluster, such as the character set for the default database defined by the <code>character_set_database</code> parameter. You can use the <i>Parameter Groups</i> option of the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon RDS console</a> or the <code>DescribeDBClusterParameters</code> action to verify that your DB cluster parameter group has been created or modified.</p> </important> <p>For more information on Amazon Aurora, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html"> What Is Amazon Aurora?</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide.</i> </p> <note> <p>This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.</p> </note>

* `post_create_db_instance` - Creates a new DB instance.
* `post_create_db_instance_read_replica` - <p>Creates a new DB instance that acts as a read replica for an existing source DB instance. You can create a read replica for a DB instance running MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html">Working with Read Replicas</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i>. </p> <p>Amazon Aurora doesn't support this action. Call the <code>CreateDBInstance</code> action to create a DB instance for an Aurora DB cluster.</p> <p>All read replica DB instances are created with backups disabled. All other DB instance attributes (including DB security groups and DB parameter groups) are inherited from the source DB instance, except as specified.</p> <important> <p>Your source DB instance must have backup retention enabled. </p> </important>
* `post_create_db_parameter_group` - <p>Creates a new DB parameter group.</p> <p> A DB parameter group is initially created with the default parameters for the database engine used by the DB instance. To provide custom values for any of the parameters, you must modify the group after creating it using <i>ModifyDBParameterGroup</i>. Once you've created a DB parameter group, you need to associate it with your DB instance using <i>ModifyDBInstance</i>. When you associate a new DB parameter group with a running DB instance, you need to reboot the DB instance without failover for the new DB parameter group and associated settings to take effect. </p> <important> <p>After you create a DB parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB instance that uses that DB parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon RDS to fully complete the create action before the parameter group is used as the default for a new DB instance. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB instance, such as the character set for the default database defined by the <code>character_set_database</code> parameter. You can use the <i>Parameter Groups</i> option of the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon RDS console</a> or the <i>DescribeDBParameters</i> command to verify that your DB parameter group has been created or modified.</p> </important>
* `post_create_db_proxy` - Creates a new DB proxy.

The ARN is displayed in the SNS console.</p> <p>You can specify the type of source (<code>SourceType</code>) that you want to be notified of and provide a list of RDS sources (<code>SourceIds</code>) that triggers the events. You can also provide a list of event categories (<code>EventCategories</code>) for events that you want to be notified of. For example, you can specify <code>SourceType</code> = <code>db-instance</code>, <code>SourceIds</code> = <code>mydbinstance1</code>, <code>mydbinstance2</code> and <code>EventCategories</code> = <code>Availability</code>, <code>Backup</code>.</p> <p>If you specify both the <code>SourceType</code> and <code>SourceIds</code>, such as <code>SourceType</code> = <code>db-instance</code> and <code>SourceIdentifier</code> = <code>myDBInstance1</code>, you are notified of all the <code>db-instance</code> events for the specified source. If you specify a <code>SourceType</code> but do not specify a <code>SourceIdentifier</code>, you receive notice of the events for that source type for all your RDS sources. If you don't specify either the SourceType or the <code>SourceIdentifier</code>, you are notified of events generated from all RDS sources belonging to your customer account.</p> <note> <p>RDS event notification is only available for unencrypted SNS topics. If you specify an encrypted SNS topic, event notifications aren't sent for the topic.</p> </note>
* `post_create_global_cluster` - <p> Creates an Aurora global database spread across multiple Amazon Web Services Regions. The global database contains a single primary cluster with read-write capability, and a read-only secondary cluster that receives data from the primary cluster through high-speed replication performed by the Aurora storage subsystem. </p> <p> You can create a global database that is initially empty, and then add a primary cluster and a secondary cluster to it.

* `post_download_db_log_file_portion` - Downloads all or a portion of the specified log file, up to 1 MB in size.
* `post_failover_db_cluster` - <p>Forces a failover for a DB cluster.</p> <p>A failover for a DB cluster promotes one of the Aurora Replicas (read-only instances) in the DB cluster to be the primary instance (the cluster writer).</p> <p>Amazon Aurora will automatically fail over to an Aurora Replica, if one exists, when the primary instance fails. You can force a failover when you want to simulate a failure of a primary instance for testing. Because each instance in a DB cluster has its own endpoint address, you will need to clean up and re-establish any existing connections that use those endpoint addresses when the failover is complete.</p> <p>For more information on Amazon Aurora, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html"> What Is Amazon Aurora?</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide.</i> </p> <note> <p>This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.</p> </note>
* `post_failover_global_cluster` - <p>Initiates the failover process for an Aurora global database (<a>GlobalCluster</a>).</p> <p>A failover for an Aurora global database promotes one of secondary read-only DB clusters to be the primary DB cluster and demotes the primary DB cluster to being a secondary (read-only) DB cluster. In other words, the role of the current primary DB cluster and the selected (target) DB cluster are switched. The selected secondary DB cluster assumes full read/write capabilities for the Aurora global database.</p> <p>For more information about failing over an Amazon Aurora global database, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.html#aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.managed-failover">Managed planned failover for Amazon Aurora global databases</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide.</i> </p> <note> <p>This action applies to <a>GlobalCluster</a> (Aurora global databases) only.

* `post_modify_certificates` - <p>Override the system-default Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificate for Amazon RDS for new DB instances temporarily, or remove the override.</p> <p>By using this operation, you can specify an RDS-approved SSL/TLS certificate for new DB instances that is different from the default certificate provided by RDS. You can also use this operation to remove the override, so that new DB instances use the default certificate provided by RDS.</p> <p>You might need to override the default certificate in the following situations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You already migrated your applications to support the latest certificate authority (CA) certificate, but the new CA certificate is not yet the RDS default CA certificate for the specified Amazon Web Services Region.</p> </li> <li> <p>RDS has already moved to a new default CA certificate for the specified Amazon Web Services Region, but you are still in the process of supporting the new CA certificate. In this case, you temporarily need additional time to finish your application changes.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about rotating your SSL/TLS certificate for RDS DB engines, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html"> Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information about rotating your SSL/TLS certificate for Aurora DB engines, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html"> Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p>
* `post_modify_current_db_cluster_capacity` - <p>Set the capacity of an Aurora Serverless DB cluster to a specific value.</p> <p>Aurora Serverless scales seamlessly based on the workload on the DB cluster. In some cases, the capacity might not scale fast enough to meet a sudden change in workload, such as a large number of new transactions. Call <code>ModifyCurrentDBClusterCapacity</code> to set the capacity explicitly.</p> <p>After this call sets the DB cluster capacity, Aurora Serverless can automatically scale the DB cluster based on the cooldown period for scaling up and the cooldown period for scaling down.</p> <p>For more information about Aurora Serverless, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.html">Using Amazon Aurora Serverless</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p> <important> <p>If you call <code>ModifyCurrentDBClusterCapacity</code> with the default <code>TimeoutAction</code>, connections that prevent Aurora Serverless from finding a scaling point might be dropped. For more information about scaling points, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.how-it-works.html#aurora-serverless.how-it-works.auto-scaling"> Autoscaling for Aurora Serverless</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide</i>.</p> </important> <note> <p>This action only applies to Aurora Serverless DB clusters.</p> </note>

To modify more than one parameter, submit a list of the following: <code>ParameterName</code>, <code>ParameterValue</code>, and <code>ApplyMethod</code>. A maximum of 20 parameters can be modified in a single request. </p> <p>For more information on Amazon Aurora, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html"> What Is Amazon Aurora?</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide.</i> </p> <important> <p>After you create a DB cluster parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB cluster that uses that DB cluster parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon RDS to fully complete the create action before the parameter group is used as the default for a new DB cluster. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB cluster, such as the character set for the default database defined by the <code>character_set_database</code> parameter. You can use the <i>Parameter Groups</i> option of the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon RDS console</a> or the <code>DescribeDBClusterParameters</code> action to verify that your DB cluster parameter group has been created or modified.</p> <p>If the modified DB cluster parameter group is used by an Aurora Serverless cluster, Aurora applies the update immediately. The cluster restart might interrupt your workload. In that case, your application must reopen any connections and retry any transactions that were active when the parameter changes took effect.</p> </important> <note> <p>This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.</p> </note>
* `post_modify_db_cluster_snapshot_attribute` - <p>Adds an attribute and values to, or removes an attribute and values from, a manual DB cluster snapshot.</p> <p>To share a manual DB cluster snapshot with other Amazon Web Services accounts, specify <code>restore</code> as the <code>AttributeName</code> and use the <code>ValuesToAdd</code> parameter to add a list of IDs of the Amazon Web Services accounts that are authorized to restore the manual DB cluster snapshot. Use the value <code>all</code> to make the manual DB cluster snapshot public, which means that it can be copied or restored by all Amazon Web Services accounts.</p> <note> <p>Don't add the <code>all</code> value for any manual DB cluster snapshots that contain private information that you don't want available to all Amazon Web Services accounts.</p> </note> <p>If a manual DB cluster snapshot is encrypted, it can be shared, but only by specifying a list of authorized Amazon Web Services account IDs for the <code>ValuesToAdd</code> parameter. You can't use <code>all</code> as a value for that parameter in this case.</p> <p>To view which Amazon Web Services accounts have access to copy or restore a manual DB cluster snapshot, or whether a manual DB cluster snapshot is public or private, use the <a>DescribeDBClusterSnapshotAttributes</a> API action. The accounts are returned as values for the <code>restore</code> attribute.</p> <note> <p>This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.</p> </note>
* `post_modify_db_instance` - Modifies settings for a DB instance. You can change one or more database configuration parameters by specifying these parameters and the new values in the request. To learn what modifications you can make to your DB instance, call <code>DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications</code> before you call <code>ModifyDBInstance</code>. 
* `post_modify_db_parameter_group` - <p> Modifies the parameters of a DB parameter group. To modify more than one parameter, submit a list of the following: <code>ParameterName</code>, <code>ParameterValue</code>, and <code>ApplyMethod</code>. A maximum of 20 parameters can be modified in a single request. </p> <important> <p>After you modify a DB parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB instance that uses that DB parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon RDS to fully complete the modify action before the parameter group is used as the default for a new DB instance. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB instance, such as the character set for the default database defined by the <code>character_set_database</code> parameter. You can use the <i>Parameter Groups</i> option of the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon RDS console</a> or the <i>DescribeDBParameters</i> command to verify that your DB parameter group has been created or modified.</p> </important>

* `post_restore_db_instance_from_db_snapshot` - <p>Creates a new DB instance from a DB snapshot. The target database is created from the source database restore point with most of the source's original configuration, including the default security group and DB parameter group. By default, the new DB instance is created as a Single-AZ deployment, except when the instance is a SQL Server instance that has an option group associated with mirroring. In this case, the instance becomes a Multi-AZ deployment, not a Single-AZ deployment.</p> <p>If you want to replace your original DB instance with the new, restored DB instance, then rename your original DB instance before you call the RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot action. RDS doesn't allow two DB instances with the same name. After you have renamed your original DB instance with a different identifier, then you can pass the original name of the DB instance as the DBInstanceIdentifier in the call to the RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot action. The result is that you replace the original DB instance with the DB instance created from the snapshot.</p> <p>If you are restoring from a shared manual DB snapshot, the <code>DBSnapshotIdentifier</code> must be the ARN of the shared DB snapshot.</p> <note> <p>This command doesn't apply to Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL. For Aurora, use <code>RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot</code>.</p> </note>
