/**
 * <p>A complex type that contains information about an optional custom health check. A custom health check, which requires that you use a third-party health checker to evaluate the health of your resources, is useful in the following circumstances:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You can't use a health check that's defined by <code>HealthCheckConfig</code> because the resource isn't available over the internet. For example, you can use a custom health check when the instance is in an Amazon VPC. (To check the health of resources in a VPC, the health checker must also be in the VPC.)</p> </li> <li> <p>You want to use a third-party health checker regardless of where your resources are located.</p> </li> </ul> <important> <p>If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either <code>HealthCheckCustomConfig</code> or <code>HealthCheckConfig</code> but not both.</p> </important> <p>To change the status of a custom health check, submit an <code>UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus</code> request. Cloud Map doesn't monitor the status of the resource, it just keeps a record of the status specified in the most recent <code>UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus</code> request.</p> <p>Here's how custom health checks work:</p> <ol> <li> <p>You create a service.</p> </li> <li> <p>You register an instance.</p> </li> <li> <p>You configure a third-party health checker to monitor the resource that's associated with the new instance. </p> <note> <p>Cloud Map doesn't check the health of the resource directly. </p> </note> </li> <li> <p>The third-party health-checker determines that the resource is unhealthy and notifies your application.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your application submits an <code>UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus</code> request.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cloud Map waits for 30 seconds.</p> </li> <li> <p>If another <code>UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus</code> request doesn't arrive during that time to change the status back to healthy, Cloud Map stops routing traffic to the resource.</p> </li> </ol>
