### SDK SDK

* `associate_assets` - Associates a child asset with the given parent asset through a hierarchy defined in the parent asset's model. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/add-associated-assets.html">Associating assets</a> in the <i>IoT SiteWise User Guide</i>.
* `batch_associate_project_assets` - Associates a group (batch) of assets with an IoT SiteWise Monitor project.
* `batch_disassociate_project_assets` - Disassociates a group (batch) of assets from an IoT SiteWise Monitor project.
* `batch_put_asset_property_value` - <p>Sends a list of asset property values to IoT SiteWise. Each value is a timestamp-quality-value (TQV) data point. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/ingest-api.html">Ingesting data using the API</a> in the <i>IoT SiteWise User Guide</i>.</p> <p>To identify an asset property, you must specify one of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The <code>assetId</code> and <code>propertyId</code> of an asset property.</p> </li> <li> <p>A <code>propertyAlias</code>, which is a data stream alias (for example, <code>/company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature</code>). To define an asset property's alias, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAssetProperty.html">UpdateAssetProperty</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <important> <p>With respect to Unix epoch time, IoT SiteWise accepts only TQVs that have a timestamp of no more than 7 days in the past and no more than 10 minutes in the future. IoT SiteWise rejects timestamps outside of the inclusive range of [-7 days, +10 minutes] and returns a <code>TimestampOutOfRangeException</code> error.</p> <p>For each asset property, IoT SiteWise overwrites TQVs with duplicate timestamps unless the newer TQV has a different quality. For example, if you store a TQV <code>{T1, GOOD, V1}</code>, then storing <code>{T1, GOOD, V2}</code> replaces the existing TQV.</p> </important> <p>IoT SiteWise authorizes access to each <code>BatchPutAssetPropertyValue</code> entry individually. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-batchputassetpropertyvalue-action">BatchPutAssetPropertyValue authorization</a> in the <i>IoT SiteWise User Guide</i>.</p>

* `create_asset_model` - Creates an asset model from specified property and hierarchy definitions. You create assets from asset models. With asset models, you can easily create assets of the same type that have standardized definitions. Each asset created from a model inherits the asset model's property and hierarchy definitions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/define-models.html">Defining asset models</a> in the <i>IoT SiteWise User Guide</i>.
* `create_dashboard` - Creates a dashboard in an IoT SiteWise Monitor project.

* `create_portal` - <p>Creates a portal, which can contain projects and dashboards. IoT SiteWise Monitor uses Amazon Web Services SSO or IAM to authenticate portal users and manage user permissions.</p> <note> <p>Before you can sign in to a new portal, you must add at least one identity to that portal. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/administer-portals.html#portal-change-admins">Adding or removing portal administrators</a> in the <i>IoT SiteWise User Guide</i>.</p> </note>

For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_DisassociateAssets.html">DisassociateAssets</a>.</p> </note>
* `delete_asset_model` - Deletes an asset model. This action can't be undone. You must delete all assets created from an asset model before you can delete the model. Also, you can't delete an asset model if a parent asset model exists that contains a property formula expression that depends on the asset model that you want to delete.

* `describe_asset_property` - <p>Retrieves information about an asset property.</p> <note> <p>When you call this operation for an attribute property, this response includes the default attribute value that you define in the asset model. If you update the default value in the model, this operation's response includes the new default value.</p> </note> <p>This operation doesn't return the value of the asset property. To get the value of an asset property, use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_GetAssetPropertyValue.html">GetAssetPropertyValue</a>.</p>

* `describe_gateway` - Retrieves information about a gateway.
* `describe_gateway_capability_configuration` - Retrieves information about a gateway capability configuration. Each gateway capability defines data sources for a gateway. A capability configuration can contain multiple data source configurations. If you define OPC-UA sources for a gateway in the IoT SiteWise console, all of your OPC-UA sources are stored in one capability configuration.
