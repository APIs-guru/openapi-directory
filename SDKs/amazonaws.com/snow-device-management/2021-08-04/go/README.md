## SDK Available Operations

### SDK SDK

* `CancelTask` - <p>Sends a cancel request for a specified task. You can cancel a task only if it's still in a <code>QUEUED</code> state. Tasks that are already running can't be cancelled.</p> <note> <p>A task might still run if it's processed from the queue before the <code>CancelTask</code> operation changes the task's state.</p> </note>
* `CreateTask` - Instructs one or more devices to start a task, such as unlocking or rebooting.
* `DescribeDevice` - Checks device-specific information, such as the device type, software version, IP addresses, and lock status.
* `DescribeDeviceEc2Instances` - Checks the current state of the Amazon EC2 instances. The output is similar to <code>describeDevice</code>, but the results are sourced from the device cache in the Amazon Web Services Cloud and include a subset of the available fields. 
* `DescribeExecution` - Checks the status of a remote task running on one or more target devices.
* `DescribeTask` - Checks the metadata for a given task on a device. 
* `ListDeviceResources` - Returns a list of the Amazon Web Services resources available for a device. Currently, Amazon EC2 instances are the only supported resource type.
* `ListDevices` - Returns a list of all devices on your Amazon Web Services account that have Amazon Web Services Snow Device Management enabled in the Amazon Web Services Region where the command is run.
* `ListExecutions` - Returns the status of tasks for one or more target devices.
* `ListTagsForResource` - Returns a list of tags for a managed device or task.
* `ListTasks` - Returns a list of tasks that can be filtered by state.
* `TagResource` - Adds or replaces tags on a device or task.
* `UntagResource` - Removes a tag from a device or task.
