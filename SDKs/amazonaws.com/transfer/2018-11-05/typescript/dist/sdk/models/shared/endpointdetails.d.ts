To control incoming internet traffic, invoke the <code>UpdateServer</code> API and attach an Elastic IP address to your server's endpoint.</p> <note> <p> After May 19, 2021, you won't be able to create a server using <code>EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT</code> in your Amazon Web Servicesaccount if your account hasn't already done so before May 19, 2021.

After this date, use <code>EndpointType</code>=<code>VPC</code>.</p> <p>For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint.</p> </note>
