// ExportedEnvironmentVariable
// <p>Contains information about an exported environment variable. </p> <p>Exported environment variables are used in conjunction with CodePipeline to export environment variables from the current build stage to subsequent stages in the pipeline. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/actions-variables.html">Working with variables</a> in the <i>CodePipeline User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p> During a build, the value of a variable is available starting with the <code>install</code> phase. It can be updated between the start of the <code>install</code> phase and the end of the <code>post_build</code> phase. After the <code>post_build</code> phase ends, the value of exported variables cannot change.</p> </note>
