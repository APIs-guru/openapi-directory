## SDK Available Operations

### SDK SDK

* `createNotificationRule` - Creates a notification rule for a resource. The rule specifies the events you want notifications about and the targets (such as SNS topics) where you want to receive them.
* `deleteNotificationRule` - Deletes a notification rule for a resource.
* `deleteTarget` - Deletes a specified target for notifications.
* `describeNotificationRule` - Returns information about a specified notification rule.
* `listEventTypes` - Returns information about the event types available for configuring notifications.
* `listNotificationRules` - Returns a list of the notification rules for an AWS account.
* `listTagsForResource` - Returns a list of the tags associated with a notification rule.
* `listTargets` - Returns a list of the notification rule targets for an AWS account.
* `subscribe` - Creates an association between a notification rule and an SNS topic so that the associated target can receive notifications when the events described in the rule are triggered.
* `tagResource` - Associates a set of provided tags with a notification rule.
* `unsubscribe` - Removes an association between a notification rule and an Amazon SNS topic so that subscribers to that topic stop receiving notifications when the events described in the rule are triggered.
* `untagResource` - Removes the association between one or more provided tags and a notification rule.
* `updateNotificationRule` - <p>Updates a notification rule for a resource. You can change the events that trigger the notification rule, the status of the rule, and the targets that receive the notifications.</p> <note> <p>To add or remove tags for a notification rule, you must use <a>TagResource</a> and <a>UntagResource</a>.</p> </note>
