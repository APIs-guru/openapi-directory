* `createEnvironment` - Deploy a new environment. An AWS Proton environment is created from an environment template that defines infrastructure and resources that can be shared across services. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/adminguide/ag-environments.html">Environments</a> in the <i>AWS Proton Administrator Guide.</i> 
* `createEnvironmentAccountConnection` - <p>Create an environment account connection in an environment account so that environment infrastructure resources can be provisioned in the environment account from a management account.</p> <p>An environment account connection is a secure bi-directional connection between a <i>management account</i> and an <i>environment account</i> that maintains authorization and permissions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/adminguide/ag-env-account-connections.html">Environment account connections</a> in the <i>AWS Proton Administrator guide</i>.</p>

AWS Proton <i>doesn't</i> manage your existing provisioned infrastructure. To create an environment template for customer provisioned and managed infrastructure, include the <code>provisioning</code> parameter and set the value to <code>CUSTOMER_MANAGED</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/adminguide/template-create.html">Register and publish an environment template</a> in the <i>AWS Proton Administrator Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul>
* `createEnvironmentTemplateVersion` - Create a new major or minor version of an environment template. A major version of an environment template is a version that <i>isn't</i> backwards compatible. A minor version of an environment template is a version that's backwards compatible within its major version.
* `createService` - Create an AWS Proton service. An AWS Proton service is an instantiation of a service template and often includes several service instances and pipeline. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/adminguide/ag-services.html">Services</a> in the <i>AWS Proton Administrator Guide</i> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ug-service.html">Services</a> in the <i>AWS Proton User Guide</i>.
* `createServiceTemplate` - Create a service template. The administrator creates a service template to define standardized infrastructure and an optional CICD service pipeline. Developers, in turn, select the service template from AWS Proton. If the selected service template includes a service pipeline definition, they provide a link to their source code repository. AWS Proton then deploys and manages the infrastructure defined by the selected service template. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/adminguide/managing-svc-templates.html">Service Templates</a> in the <i>AWS Proton Administrator Guide</i>.

* `deleteEnvironmentTemplateVersion` - <p>If no other minor versions of an environment template exist, delete a major version of the environment template if it's not the <code>Recommended</code> version. Delete the <code>Recommended</code> version of the environment template if no other major versions or minor versions of the environment template exist. A major version of an environment template is a version that's not backwards compatible.</p> <p>Delete a minor version of an environment template if it <i>isn't</i> the <code>Recommended</code> version. Delete a <code>Recommended</code> minor version of the environment template if no other minor versions of the environment template exist. A minor version of an environment template is a version that's backwards compatible.</p>
* `deleteService` - Delete a service.
* `deleteServiceTemplate` - If no other major or minor versions of the service template exist, delete the service template.
* `deleteServiceTemplateVersion` - <p>If no other minor versions of a service template exist, delete a major version of the service template if it's not the <code>Recommended</code> version.
