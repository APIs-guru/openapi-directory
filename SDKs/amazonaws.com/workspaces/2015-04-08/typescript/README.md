* `associateConnectionAlias` - <p>Associates the specified connection alias with the specified directory to enable cross-Region redirection. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/cross-region-redirection.html"> Cross-Region Redirection for Amazon WorkSpaces</a>.</p> <note> <p>Before performing this operation, call <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/api/API_DescribeConnectionAliases.html"> DescribeConnectionAliases</a> to make sure that the current state of the connection alias is <code>CREATED</code>.</p> </note>
* `associateIpGroups` - Associates the specified IP access control group with the specified directory.
* `authorizeIpRules` - <p>Adds one or more rules to the specified IP access control group.</p> <p>This action gives users permission to access their WorkSpaces from the CIDR address ranges specified in the rules.</p>
* `copyWorkspaceImage` - <p>Copies the specified image from the specified Region to the current Region. For more information about copying images, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/copy-custom-image.html"> Copy a Custom WorkSpaces Image</a>.</p> <note> <p>In the China (Ningxia) Region, you can copy images only within the same Region.</p> <p>In the AWS GovCloud (US-West) Region, to copy images to and from other AWS Regions, contact AWS Support.</p> </note> <important> <p>Before copying a shared image, be sure to verify that it has been shared from the correct AWS account. To determine if an image has been shared and to see the AWS account ID that owns an image, use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/api/API_DescribeWorkspaceImages.html">DescribeWorkSpaceImages</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/api/API_DescribeWorkspaceImagePermissions.html">DescribeWorkspaceImagePermissions</a> API operations. </p> </important>
* `createConnectionAlias` - Creates the specified connection alias for use with cross-Region redirection. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/cross-region-redirection.html"> Cross-Region Redirection for Amazon WorkSpaces</a>.
* `createIpGroup` - <p>Creates an IP access control group.</p> <p>An IP access control group provides you with the ability to control the IP addresses from which users are allowed to access their WorkSpaces. To specify the CIDR address ranges, add rules to your IP access control group and then associate the group with your directory. You can add rules when you create the group or at any time using <a>AuthorizeIpRules</a>.</p> <p>There is a default IP access control group associated with your directory. If you don't associate an IP access control group with your directory, the default group is used. The default group includes a default rule that allows users to access their WorkSpaces from anywhere. You cannot modify the default IP access control group for your directory.</p>
* `createTags` - Creates the specified tags for the specified WorkSpaces resource.
* `createWorkspaceBundle` - Creates the specified WorkSpace bundle. For more information about creating WorkSpace bundles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/create-custom-bundle.html"> Create a Custom WorkSpaces Image and Bundle</a>.
* `createWorkspaces` - <p>Creates one or more WorkSpaces.</p> <p>This operation is asynchronous and returns before the WorkSpaces are created.</p>
* `deleteConnectionAlias` - <p>Deletes the specified connection alias. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/cross-region-redirection.html"> Cross-Region Redirection for Amazon WorkSpaces</a>.</p> <important> <p> <b>If you will no longer be using a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) as the registration code for your WorkSpaces users, you must take certain precautions to prevent potential security issues.</b> For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/cross-region-redirection.html#cross-region-redirection-security-considerations"> Security Considerations if You Stop Using Cross-Region Redirection</a>.</p> </important> <note> <p>To delete a connection alias that has been shared, the shared account must first disassociate the connection alias from any directories it has been associated with. Then you must unshare the connection alias from the account it has been shared with. You can delete a connection alias only after it is no longer shared with any accounts or associated with any directories.</p> </note>
* `deleteIpGroup` - <p>Deletes the specified IP access control group.</p> <p>You cannot delete an IP access control group that is associated with a directory.</p>
* `deleteTags` - Deletes the specified tags from the specified WorkSpaces resource.
* `deleteWorkspaceBundle` - Deletes the specified WorkSpace bundle. For more information about deleting WorkSpace bundles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/delete_bundle.html"> Delete a Custom WorkSpaces Bundle or Image</a>.

It is used for interactive streaming of the WorkSpace desktop to Amazon WorkSpaces clients, and to allow Amazon WorkSpaces to manage the WorkSpace.</p>
* `migrateWorkspace` - <p>Migrates a WorkSpace from one operating system or bundle type to another, while retaining the data on the user volume.</p> <p>The migration process recreates the WorkSpace by using a new root volume from the target bundle image and the user volume from the last available snapshot of the original WorkSpace. During migration, the original <code>D:\Users\%USERNAME%</code> user profile folder is renamed to <code>D:\Users\%USERNAME%MMddyyTHHmmss%.NotMigrated</code>. A new <code>D:\Users\%USERNAME%\</code> folder is generated by the new OS. Certain files in the old user profile are moved to the new user profile.</p> <p>For available migration scenarios, details about what happens during migration, and best practices, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/migrate-workspaces.html">Migrate a WorkSpace</a>.</p>

* `modifyWorkspaceState` - <p>Sets the state of the specified WorkSpace.</p> <p>To maintain a WorkSpace without being interrupted, set the WorkSpace state to <code>ADMIN_MAINTENANCE</code>. WorkSpaces in this state do not respond to requests to reboot, stop, start, rebuild, or restore. An AutoStop WorkSpace in this state is not stopped. Users cannot log into a WorkSpace in the <code>ADMIN_MAINTENANCE</code> state.</p>
* `rebootWorkspaces` - <p>Reboots the specified WorkSpaces.</p> <p>You cannot reboot a WorkSpace unless its state is <code>AVAILABLE</code> or <code>UNHEALTHY</code>.</p> <p>This operation is asynchronous and returns before the WorkSpaces have rebooted.</p>
* `rebuildWorkspaces` - <p>Rebuilds the specified WorkSpace.</p> <p>You cannot rebuild a WorkSpace unless its state is <code>AVAILABLE</code>, <code>ERROR</code>, <code>UNHEALTHY</code>, <code>STOPPED</code>, or <code>REBOOTING</code>.</p> <p>Rebuilding a WorkSpace is a potentially destructive action that can result in the loss of data. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/reset-workspace.html">Rebuild a WorkSpace</a>.</p> <p>This operation is asynchronous and returns before the WorkSpaces have been completely rebuilt.</p>
* `registerWorkspaceDirectory` - Registers the specified directory. This operation is asynchronous and returns before the WorkSpace directory is registered. If this is the first time you are registering a directory, you will need to create the workspaces_DefaultRole role before you can register a directory. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/workspaces-access-control.html#create-default-role"> Creating the workspaces_DefaultRole Role</a>.
* `restoreWorkspace` - <p>Restores the specified WorkSpace to its last known healthy state.</p> <p>You cannot restore a WorkSpace unless its state is <code> AVAILABLE</code>, <code>ERROR</code>, <code>UNHEALTHY</code>, or <code>STOPPED</code>.</p> <p>Restoring a WorkSpace is a potentially destructive action that can result in the loss of data. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/restore-workspace.html">Restore a WorkSpace</a>.</p> <p>This operation is asynchronous and returns before the WorkSpace is completely restored.</p>
* `revokeIpRules` - Removes one or more rules from the specified IP access control group.
* `startWorkspaces` - <p>Starts the specified WorkSpaces.</p> <p>You cannot start a WorkSpace unless it has a running mode of <code>AutoStop</code> and a state of <code>STOPPED</code>.</p>

* `terminateWorkspaces` - <p>Terminates the specified WorkSpaces.</p> <important> <p>Terminating a WorkSpace is a permanent action and cannot be undone. The user's data is destroyed. If you need to archive any user data, contact AWS Support before terminating the WorkSpace.</p> </important> <p>You can terminate a WorkSpace that is in any state except <code>SUSPENDED</code>.</p> <p>This operation is asynchronous and returns before the WorkSpaces have been completely terminated. After a WorkSpace is terminated, the <code>TERMINATED</code> state is returned only briefly before the WorkSpace directory metadata is cleaned up, so this state is rarely returned. To confirm that a WorkSpace is terminated, check for the WorkSpace ID by using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/api/API_DescribeWorkspaces.html"> DescribeWorkSpaces</a>. If the WorkSpace ID isn't returned, then the WorkSpace has been successfully terminated.</p> <note> <p>Simple AD and AD Connector are made available to you free of charge to use with WorkSpaces. If there are no WorkSpaces being used with your Simple AD or AD Connector directory for 30 consecutive days, this directory will be automatically deregistered for use with Amazon WorkSpaces, and you will be charged for this directory as per the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/pricing/">AWS Directory Services pricing terms</a>.</p> <p>To delete empty directories, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/delete-workspaces-directory.html"> Delete the Directory for Your WorkSpaces</a>.
