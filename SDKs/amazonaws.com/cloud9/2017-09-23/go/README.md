### SDK SDK

* `CreateEnvironmentEc2` - Creates an Cloud9 development environment, launches an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, and then connects from the instance to the environment.
* `CreateEnvironmentMembership` - Adds an environment member to an Cloud9 development environment.
* `DeleteEnvironment` - Deletes an Cloud9 development environment. If an Amazon EC2 instance is connected to the environment, also terminates the instance.
* `DeleteEnvironmentMembership` - Deletes an environment member from an Cloud9 development environment.
* `DescribeEnvironmentMemberships` - Gets information about environment members for an Cloud9 development environment.
* `DescribeEnvironmentStatus` - Gets status information for an Cloud9 development environment.
* `DescribeEnvironments` - Gets information about Cloud9 development environments.
* `ListEnvironments` - Gets a list of Cloud9 development environment identifiers.
* `ListTagsForResource` - Gets a list of the tags associated with an Cloud9 development environment.
* `TagResource` - <p>Adds tags to an Cloud9 development environment.</p> <important> <p>Tags that you add to an Cloud9 environment by using this method will NOT be automatically propagated to underlying resources.</p> </important>
* `UntagResource` - Removes tags from an Cloud9 development environment.
* `UpdateEnvironment` - Changes the settings of an existing Cloud9 development environment.
* `UpdateEnvironmentMembership` - Changes the settings of an existing environment member for an Cloud9 development environment.
