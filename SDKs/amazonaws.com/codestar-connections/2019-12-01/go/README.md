## SDK Available Operations

### SDK SDK

* `CreateConnection` - Creates a connection that can then be given to other AWS services like CodePipeline so that it can access third-party code repositories. The connection is in pending status until the third-party connection handshake is completed from the console.
* `CreateHost` - <p>Creates a resource that represents the infrastructure where a third-party provider is installed. The host is used when you create connections to an installed third-party provider type, such as GitHub Enterprise Server. You create one host for all connections to that provider.</p> <note> <p>A host created through the CLI or the SDK is in `PENDING` status by default. You can make its status `AVAILABLE` by setting up the host in the console.</p> </note>
* `DeleteConnection` - The connection to be deleted.
* `DeleteHost` - <p>The host to be deleted. Before you delete a host, all connections associated to the host must be deleted.</p> <note> <p>A host cannot be deleted if it is in the VPC_CONFIG_INITIALIZING or VPC_CONFIG_DELETING state.</p> </note>
* `GetConnection` - Returns the connection ARN and details such as status, owner, and provider type.
* `GetHost` - Returns the host ARN and details such as status, provider type, endpoint, and, if applicable, the VPC configuration.
* `ListConnections` - Lists the connections associated with your account.
* `ListHosts` - Lists the hosts associated with your account.
* `ListTagsForResource` - Gets the set of key-value pairs (metadata) that are used to manage the resource.
* `TagResource` - Adds to or modifies the tags of the given resource. Tags are metadata that can be used to manage a resource.
* `UntagResource` - Removes tags from an AWS resource.
* `UpdateHost` - Updates a specified host with the provided configurations.
