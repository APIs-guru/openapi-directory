## SDK Available Operations

### SDK SDK

* `get_accept_transit_gateway_multicast_domain_associations` - Accepts a request to associate subnets with a transit gateway multicast domain.
* `get_accept_transit_gateway_peering_attachment` - Accepts a transit gateway peering attachment request. The peering attachment must be in the <code>pendingAcceptance</code> state.
* `get_accept_transit_gateway_vpc_attachment` - <p>Accepts a request to attach a VPC to a transit gateway.</p> <p>The VPC attachment must be in the <code>pendingAcceptance</code> state. Use <a>DescribeTransitGatewayVpcAttachments</a> to view your pending VPC attachment requests. Use <a>RejectTransitGatewayVpcAttachment</a> to reject a VPC attachment request.</p>
* `get_accept_vpc_endpoint_connections` - Accepts one or more interface VPC endpoint connection requests to your VPC endpoint service.
* `get_accept_vpc_peering_connection` - <p>Accept a VPC peering connection request. To accept a request, the VPC peering connection must be in the <code>pending-acceptance</code> state, and you must be the owner of the peer VPC. Use <a>DescribeVpcPeeringConnections</a> to view your outstanding VPC peering connection requests.</p> <p>For an inter-Region VPC peering connection request, you must accept the VPC peering connection in the Region of the accepter VPC.</p>
* `get_advertise_byoip_cidr` - <p>Advertises an IPv4 or IPv6 address range that is provisioned for use with your Amazon Web Services resources through bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP).</p> <p>You can perform this operation at most once every 10 seconds, even if you specify different address ranges each time.</p> <p>We recommend that you stop advertising the BYOIP CIDR from other locations when you advertise it from Amazon Web Services. To minimize down time, you can configure your Amazon Web Services resources to use an address from a BYOIP CIDR before it is advertised, and then simultaneously stop advertising it from the current location and start advertising it through Amazon Web Services.</p> <p>It can take a few minutes before traffic to the specified addresses starts routing to Amazon Web Services because of BGP propagation delays.</p> <p>To stop advertising the BYOIP CIDR, use <a>WithdrawByoipCidr</a>.</p>
* `get_apply_security_groups_to_client_vpn_target_network` - Applies a security group to the association between the target network and the Client VPN endpoint. This action replaces the existing security groups with the specified security groups.
* `get_assign_ipv6_addresses` - <p>Assigns one or more IPv6 addresses to the specified network interface. You can specify one or more specific IPv6 addresses, or you can specify the number of IPv6 addresses to be automatically assigned from within the subnet's IPv6 CIDR block range. You can assign as many IPv6 addresses to a network interface as you can assign private IPv4 addresses, and the limit varies per instance type. For information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html#AvailableIpPerENI">IP Addresses Per Network Interface Per Instance Type</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You must specify either the IPv6 addresses or the IPv6 address count in the request. </p> <p>You can optionally use Prefix Delegation on the network interface. You must specify either the IPV6 Prefix Delegation prefixes, or the IPv6 Prefix Delegation count. For information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-prefix-eni.html"> Assigning prefixes to Amazon EC2 network interfaces</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
* `get_assign_private_ip_addresses` - <p>Assigns one or more secondary private IP addresses to the specified network interface.</p> <p>You can specify one or more specific secondary IP addresses, or you can specify the number of secondary IP addresses to be automatically assigned within the subnet's CIDR block range. The number of secondary IP addresses that you can assign to an instance varies by instance type. For information about instance types, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html">Instance Types</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>. For more information about Elastic IP addresses, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html">Elastic IP Addresses</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p> <p>When you move a secondary private IP address to another network interface, any Elastic IP address that is associated with the IP address is also moved.</p> <p>Remapping an IP address is an asynchronous operation. When you move an IP address from one network interface to another, check <code>network/interfaces/macs/mac/local-ipv4s</code> in the instance metadata to confirm that the remapping is complete.</p> <p>You must specify either the IP addresses or the IP address count in the request.</p> <p>You can optionally use Prefix Delegation on the network interface. You must specify either the IPv4 Prefix Delegation prefixes, or the IPv4 Prefix Delegation count. For information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-prefix-eni.html"> Assigning prefixes to Amazon EC2 network interfaces</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
* `get_associate_address` - <p>Associates an Elastic IP address, or carrier IP address (for instances that are in subnets in Wavelength Zones) with an instance or a network interface. Before you can use an Elastic IP address, you must allocate it to your account.</p> <p>An Elastic IP address is for use in either the EC2-Classic platform or in a VPC. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html">Elastic IP Addresses</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p> <p>[EC2-Classic, VPC in an EC2-VPC-only account] If the Elastic IP address is already associated with a different instance, it is disassociated from that instance and associated with the specified instance. If you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance that has an existing Elastic IP address, the existing address is disassociated from the instance, but remains allocated to your account.</p> <p>[VPC in an EC2-Classic account] If you don't specify a private IP address, the Elastic IP address is associated with the primary IP address. If the Elastic IP address is already associated with a different instance or a network interface, you get an error unless you allow reassociation. You cannot associate an Elastic IP address with an instance or network interface that has an existing Elastic IP address.</p> <p>[Subnets in Wavelength Zones] You can associate an IP address from the telecommunication carrier to the instance or network interface. </p> <p>You cannot associate an Elastic IP address with an interface in a different network border group.</p> <important> <p>This is an idempotent operation. If you perform the operation more than once, Amazon EC2 doesn't return an error, and you may be charged for each time the Elastic IP address is remapped to the same instance. For more information, see the <i>Elastic IP Addresses</i> section of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/">Amazon EC2 Pricing</a>.</p> </important>
* `get_associate_client_vpn_target_network` - <p>Associates a target network with a Client VPN endpoint. A target network is a subnet in a VPC. You can associate multiple subnets from the same VPC with a Client VPN endpoint. You can associate only one subnet in each Availability Zone. We recommend that you associate at least two subnets to provide Availability Zone redundancy.</p> <p>If you specified a VPC when you created the Client VPN endpoint or if you have previous subnet associations, the specified subnet must be in the same VPC. To specify a subnet that's in a different VPC, you must first modify the Client VPN endpoint (<a>ModifyClientVpnEndpoint</a>) and change the VPC that's associated with it.</p>
* `get_associate_dhcp_options` - <p>Associates a set of DHCP options (that you've previously created) with the specified VPC, or associates no DHCP options with the VPC.</p> <p>After you associate the options with the VPC, any existing instances and all new instances that you launch in that VPC use the options. You don't need to restart or relaunch the instances. They automatically pick up the changes within a few hours, depending on how frequently the instance renews its DHCP lease. You can explicitly renew the lease using the operating system on the instance.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html">DHCP options sets</a> in the <i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
* `get_associate_enclave_certificate_iam_role` - <p>Associates an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with an Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate. This enables the certificate to be used by the ACM for Nitro Enclaves application inside an enclave. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave-refapp.html">Certificate Manager for Nitro Enclaves</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves User Guide</i>.</p> <p>When the IAM role is associated with the ACM certificate, the certificate, certificate chain, and encrypted private key are placed in an Amazon S3 bucket that only the associated IAM role can access. The private key of the certificate is encrypted with an Amazon Web Services managed key that has an attached attestation-based key policy.</p> <p>To enable the IAM role to access the Amazon S3 object, you must grant it permission to call <code>s3:GetObject</code> on the Amazon S3 bucket returned by the command. To enable the IAM role to access the KMS key, you must grant it permission to call <code>kms:Decrypt</code> on the KMS key returned by the command. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave-refapp.html#add-policy"> Grant the role permission to access the certificate and encryption key</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves User Guide</i>.</p>

Use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTransitGatewayAttachments.html">DescribeTransitGatewayAttachments</a> to see the state of the attachment.</p>
* `get_associate_transit_gateway_route_table` - Associates the specified attachment with the specified transit gateway route table. You can associate only one route table with an attachment.
* `get_associate_trunk_interface` - <note> <p>This API action is currently in <b>limited preview only</b>. If you are interested in using this feature, contact your account manager.</p> </note> <p>Associates a branch network interface with a trunk network interface.</p> <p>Before you create the association, run the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateNetworkInterface.html">create-network-interface</a> command and set <code>--interface-type</code> to <code>trunk</code>. You must also create a network interface for each branch network interface that you want to associate with the trunk network interface.</p>
* `get_associate_vpc_cidr_block` - <p>Associates a CIDR block with your VPC. You can associate a secondary IPv4 CIDR block, an Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR block, or an IPv6 CIDR block from an IPv6 address pool that you provisioned through bring your own IP addresses (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-byoip.html">BYOIP</a>). The IPv6 CIDR block size is fixed at /56.</p> <p>You must specify one of the following in the request: an IPv4 CIDR block, an IPv6 pool, or an Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR block.</p> <p>For more information about associating CIDR blocks with your VPC and applicable restrictions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html#VPC_Sizing">VPC and subnet sizing</a> in the <i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
* `get_attach_classic_link_vpc` - <p>Links an EC2-Classic instance to a ClassicLink-enabled VPC through one or more of the VPC's security groups. You cannot link an EC2-Classic instance to more than one VPC at a time. You can only link an instance that's in the <code>running</code> state. An instance is automatically unlinked from a VPC when it's stopped - you can link it to the VPC again when you restart it.</p> <p>After you've linked an instance, you cannot change the VPC security groups that are associated with it. To change the security groups, you must first unlink the instance, and then link it again.</p> <p>Linking your instance to a VPC is sometimes referred to as <i>attaching</i> your instance.</p>
* `get_attach_internet_gateway` - Attaches an internet gateway or a virtual private gateway to a VPC, enabling connectivity between the internet and the VPC.

* `get_cancel_capacity_reservation` - <p>Cancels the specified Capacity Reservation, releases the reserved capacity, and changes the Capacity Reservation's state to <code>cancelled</code>.</p> <p>Instances running in the reserved capacity continue running until you stop them. Stopped instances that target the Capacity Reservation can no longer launch. Modify these instances to either target a different Capacity Reservation, launch On-Demand Instance capacity, or run in any open Capacity Reservation that has matching attributes and sufficient capacity.</p>
* `get_cancel_conversion_task` - <p>Cancels an active conversion task. The task can be the import of an instance or volume. The action removes all artifacts of the conversion, including a partially uploaded volume or instance. If the conversion is complete or is in the process of transferring the final disk image, the command fails and returns an exception.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/CommandLineReference/ec2-cli-vmimport-export.html">Importing a Virtual Machine Using the Amazon EC2 CLI</a>.</p>
* `get_cancel_export_task` - Cancels an active export task. The request removes all artifacts of the export, including any partially-created Amazon S3 objects. If the export task is complete or is in the process of transferring the final disk image, the command fails and returns an error.

* `get_copy_fpga_image` - Copies the specified Amazon FPGA Image (AFI) to the current Region.
* `get_copy_image` - <p>Initiates the copy of an AMI. You can copy an AMI from one Region to another, or from a Region to an Outpost. You can't copy an AMI from an Outpost to a Region, from one Outpost to another, or within the same Outpost. To copy an AMI to another partition, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateStoreImageTask.html">CreateStoreImageTask</a>.</p> <p>To copy an AMI from one Region to another, specify the source Region using the <b>SourceRegion</b> parameter, and specify the destination Region using its endpoint. Copies of encrypted backing snapshots for the AMI are encrypted. Copies of unencrypted backing snapshots remain unencrypted, unless you set <code>Encrypted</code> during the copy operation. You cannot create an unencrypted copy of an encrypted backing snapshot.</p> <p>To copy an AMI from a Region to an Outpost, specify the source Region using the <b>SourceRegion</b> parameter, and specify the ARN of the destination Outpost using <b>DestinationOutpostArn</b>. Backing snapshots copied to an Outpost are encrypted by default using the default encryption key for the Region, or a different key that you specify in the request using <b>KmsKeyId</b>. Outposts do not support unencrypted snapshots. For more information, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/snapshots-outposts.html#ami"> Amazon EBS local snapshots on Outposts</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information about the prerequisites and limits when copying an AMI, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/CopyingAMIs.html">Copying an AMI</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
* `get_create_client_vpn_route` - Adds a route to a network to a Client VPN endpoint. Each Client VPN endpoint has a route table that describes the available destination network routes. Each route in the route table specifies the path for traﬃc to speciﬁc resources or networks.
* `get_create_default_subnet` - Creates a default subnet with a size <code>/20</code> IPv4 CIDR block in the specified Availability Zone in your default VPC. You can have only one default subnet per Availability Zone. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/default-vpc.html#create-default-subnet">Creating a default subnet</a> in the <i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>.
* `get_create_default_vpc` - <p>Creates a default VPC with a size <code>/16</code> IPv4 CIDR block and a default subnet in each Availability Zone. For more information about the components of a default VPC, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/default-vpc.html">Default VPC and default subnets</a> in the <i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>. You cannot specify the components of the default VPC yourself.</p> <p>If you deleted your previous default VPC, you can create a default VPC. You cannot have more than one default VPC per Region.</p> <p>If your account supports EC2-Classic, you cannot use this action to create a default VPC in a Region that supports EC2-Classic. If you want a default VPC in a Region that supports EC2-Classic, see "I really want a default VPC for my existing EC2 account. Is that possible?" in the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/#Default_VPCs">Default VPCs FAQ</a>.</p>
* `get_create_local_gateway_route` - Creates a static route for the specified local gateway route table.
* `get_create_network_acl_entry` - <p>Creates an entry (a rule) in a network ACL with the specified rule number. Each network ACL has a set of numbered ingress rules and a separate set of numbered egress rules. When determining whether a packet should be allowed in or out of a subnet associated with the ACL, we process the entries in the ACL according to the rule numbers, in ascending order. Each network ACL has a set of ingress rules and a separate set of egress rules.</p> <p>We recommend that you leave room between the rule numbers (for example, 100, 110, 120, ...), and not number them one right after the other (for example, 101, 102, 103, ...). This makes it easier to add a rule between existing ones without having to renumber the rules.</p> <p>After you add an entry, you can't modify it; you must either replace it, or create an entry and delete the old one.</p> <p>For more information about network ACLs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_ACLs.html">Network ACLs</a> in the <i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
* `get_create_network_interface_permission` - <p>Grants an Amazon Web Services-authorized account permission to attach the specified network interface to an instance in their account.</p> <p>You can grant permission to a single Amazon Web Services account only, and only one account at a time.</p>
* `get_create_route` - <p>Creates a route in a route table within a VPC.</p> <p>You must specify one of the following targets: internet gateway or virtual private gateway, NAT instance, NAT gateway, VPC peering connection, network interface, egress-only internet gateway, or transit gateway.</p> <p>When determining how to route traffic, we use the route with the most specific match. For example, traffic is destined for the IPv4 address <code>192.0.2.3</code>, and the route table includes the following two IPv4 routes:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>192.0.2.0/24</code> (goes to some target A)</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>192.0.2.0/28</code> (goes to some target B)</p> </li> </ul> <p>Both routes apply to the traffic destined for <code>192.0.2.3</code>. However, the second route in the list covers a smaller number of IP addresses and is therefore more specific, so we use that route to determine where to target the traffic.</p> <p>For more information about route tables, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html">Route tables</a> in the <i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
* `get_create_spot_datafeed_subscription` - Creates a data feed for Spot Instances, enabling you to view Spot Instance usage logs. You can create one data feed per Amazon Web Services account. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-data-feeds.html">Spot Instance data feed</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances</i>.
* `get_create_traffic_mirror_filter_rule` - <p>Creates a Traffic Mirror filter rule. </p> <p>A Traffic Mirror rule defines the Traffic Mirror source traffic to mirror.</p> <p>You need the Traffic Mirror filter ID when you create the rule.</p>

* `get_delete_client_vpn_endpoint` - Deletes the specified Client VPN endpoint. You must disassociate all target networks before you can delete a Client VPN endpoint.
* `get_delete_client_vpn_route` - Deletes a route from a Client VPN endpoint. You can only delete routes that you manually added using the <b>CreateClientVpnRoute</b> action. You cannot delete routes that were automatically added when associating a subnet. To remove routes that have been automatically added, disassociate the target subnet from the Client VPN endpoint.
* `get_delete_customer_gateway` - Deletes the specified customer gateway. You must delete the VPN connection before you can delete the customer gateway.
* `get_delete_dhcp_options` - Deletes the specified set of DHCP options. You must disassociate the set of DHCP options before you can delete it. You can disassociate the set of DHCP options by associating either a new set of options or the default set of options with the VPC.
* `get_delete_egress_only_internet_gateway` - Deletes an egress-only internet gateway.
* `get_delete_fleets` - <p>Deletes the specified EC2 Fleet.</p> <p>After you delete an EC2 Fleet, it launches no new instances.</p> <p>You must specify whether a deleted EC2 Fleet should also terminate its instances. If you choose to terminate the instances, the EC2 Fleet enters the <code>deleted_terminating</code> state. Otherwise, the EC2 Fleet enters the <code>deleted_running</code> state, and the instances continue to run until they are interrupted or you terminate them manually.</p> <p>For <code>instant</code> fleets, EC2 Fleet must terminate the instances when the fleet is deleted.

For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html#recognize-expanded-volume-linux">Extend a Linux file system</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html#recognize-expanded-volume-windows">Extend a Windows file system</a>.</p> <p> You can use CloudWatch Events to check the status of a modification to an EBS volume. For information about CloudWatch Events, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/">Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide</a>. You can also track the status of a modification using <a>DescribeVolumesModifications</a>. For information about tracking status changes using either method, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-volume-modifications.html">Monitor the progress of volume modifications</a>.</p> <p>With previous-generation instance types, resizing an EBS volume might require detaching and reattaching the volume or stopping and restarting the instance.</p> <p>If you reach the maximum volume modification rate per volume limit, you must wait at least six hours before applying further modifications to the affected EBS volume.</p>
* `get_modify_volume_attribute` - <p>Modifies a volume attribute.</p> <p>By default, all I/O operations for the volume are suspended when the data on the volume is determined to be potentially inconsistent, to prevent undetectable, latent data corruption. The I/O access to the volume can be resumed by first enabling I/O access and then checking the data consistency on your volume.</p> <p>You can change the default behavior to resume I/O operations. We recommend that you change this only for boot volumes or for volumes that are stateless or disposable.</p>
* `get_modify_vpc_attribute` - Modifies the specified attribute of the specified VPC.
* `get_modify_vpc_endpoint` - Modifies attributes of a specified VPC endpoint. The attributes that you can modify depend on the type of VPC endpoint (interface, gateway, or Gateway Load Balancer).

You can add or remove permissions for service consumers (IAM users, IAM roles, and AWS accounts) to connect to your endpoint service.</p> <p>If you grant permissions to all principals, the service is public. Any users who know the name of a public service can send a request to attach an endpoint. If the service does not require manual approval, attachments are automatically approved.</p>
* `get_modify_vpc_peering_connection_options` - <p>Modifies the VPC peering connection options on one side of a VPC peering connection. You can do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Enable/disable communication over the peering connection between an EC2-Classic instance that's linked to your VPC (using ClassicLink) and instances in the peer VPC.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enable/disable communication over the peering connection between instances in your VPC and an EC2-Classic instance that's linked to the peer VPC.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enable/disable the ability to resolve public DNS hostnames to private IP addresses when queried from instances in the peer VPC.</p> </li> </ul> <p>If the peered VPCs are in the same Amazon Web Services account, you can enable DNS resolution for queries from the local VPC. This ensures that queries from the local VPC resolve to private IP addresses in the peer VPC. This option is not available if the peered VPCs are in different different Amazon Web Services accounts or different Regions. For peered VPCs in different Amazon Web Services accounts, each Amazon Web Services account owner must initiate a separate request to modify the peering connection options. For inter-region peering connections, you must use the Region for the requester VPC to modify the requester VPC peering options and the Region for the accepter VPC to modify the accepter VPC peering options. To verify which VPCs are the accepter and the requester for a VPC peering connection, use the <a>DescribeVpcPeeringConnections</a> command.</p>
* `get_modify_vpc_tenancy` - <p>Modifies the instance tenancy attribute of the specified VPC. You can change the instance tenancy attribute of a VPC to <code>default</code> only. You cannot change the instance tenancy attribute to <code>dedicated</code>.</p> <p>After you modify the tenancy of the VPC, any new instances that you launch into the VPC have a tenancy of <code>default</code>, unless you specify otherwise during launch. The tenancy of any existing instances in the VPC is not affected.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-instance.html">Dedicated Instances</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
* `get_modify_vpn_connection` - <p>Modifies the customer gateway or the target gateway of an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. To modify the target gateway, the following migration options are available:</p> <ul> <li> <p>An existing virtual private gateway to a new virtual private gateway</p> </li> <li> <p>An existing virtual private gateway to a transit gateway</p> </li> <li> <p>An existing transit gateway to a new transit gateway</p> </li> <li> <p>An existing transit gateway to a virtual private gateway</p> </li> </ul> <p>Before you perform the migration to the new gateway, you must configure the new gateway. Use <a>CreateVpnGateway</a> to create a virtual private gateway, or <a>CreateTransitGateway</a> to create a transit gateway.</p> <p>This step is required when you migrate from a virtual private gateway with static routes to a transit gateway. </p> <p>You must delete the static routes before you migrate to the new gateway.</p> <p>Keep a copy of the static route before you delete it. You will need to add back these routes to the transit gateway after the VPN connection migration is complete.</p> <p>After you migrate to the new gateway, you might need to modify your VPC route table. Use <a>CreateRoute</a> and <a>DeleteRoute</a> to make the changes described in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/modify-vpn-target.html#step-update-routing">VPN Gateway Target Modification Required VPC Route Table Updates</a> in the <i>AWS Site-to-Site VPN User Guide</i>.</p> <p> When the new gateway is a transit gateway, modify the transit gateway route table to allow traffic between the VPC and the AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. Use <a>CreateTransitGatewayRoute</a> to add the routes.</p> <p> If you deleted VPN static routes, you must add the static routes to the transit gateway route table.</p> <p>After you perform this operation, the AWS VPN endpoint's IP addresses on the AWS side and the tunnel options remain intact. Your AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection will be temporarily unavailable for a brief period while we provision the new endpoints.</p>
* `get_modify_vpn_connection_options` - <p>Modifies the connection options for your Site-to-Site VPN connection.</p> <p>When you modify the VPN connection options, the VPN endpoint IP addresses on the AWS side do not change, and the tunnel options do not change.

* `get_release_address` - <p>Releases the specified Elastic IP address.</p> <p>[EC2-Classic, default VPC] Releasing an Elastic IP address automatically disassociates it from any instance that it's associated with. To disassociate an Elastic IP address without releasing it, use <a>DisassociateAddress</a>.</p> <p>[Nondefault VPC] You must use <a>DisassociateAddress</a> to disassociate the Elastic IP address before you can release it. Otherwise, Amazon EC2 returns an error (<code>InvalidIPAddress.InUse</code>).</p> <p>After releasing an Elastic IP address, it is released to the IP address pool. Be sure to update your DNS records and any servers or devices that communicate with the address. If you attempt to release an Elastic IP address that you already released, you'll get an <code>AuthFailure</code> error if the address is already allocated to another Amazon Web Services account.</p> <p>[EC2-VPC] After you release an Elastic IP address for use in a VPC, you might be able to recover it. For more information, see <a>AllocateAddress</a>.</p>
* `get_release_hosts` - <p>When you no longer want to use an On-Demand Dedicated Host it can be released. On-Demand billing is stopped and the host goes into <code>released</code> state. The host ID of Dedicated Hosts that have been released can no longer be specified in another request, for example, to modify the host. You must stop or terminate all instances on a host before it can be released.</p> <p>When Dedicated Hosts are released, it may take some time for them to stop counting toward your limit and you may receive capacity errors when trying to allocate new Dedicated Hosts. Wait a few minutes and then try again.</p> <p>Released hosts still appear in a <a>DescribeHosts</a> response.</p>
* `get_replace_iam_instance_profile_association` - <p>Replaces an IAM instance profile for the specified running instance. You can use this action to change the IAM instance profile that's associated with an instance without having to disassociate the existing IAM instance profile first.</p> <p>Use <a>DescribeIamInstanceProfileAssociations</a> to get the association ID.</p>
* `get_replace_network_acl_association` - <p>Changes which network ACL a subnet is associated with. By default when you create a subnet, it's automatically associated with the default network ACL.

* `get_restore_address_to_classic` - Restores an Elastic IP address that was previously moved to the EC2-VPC platform back to the EC2-Classic platform. You cannot move an Elastic IP address that was originally allocated for use in EC2-VPC. The Elastic IP address must not be associated with an instance or network interface.
* `get_restore_managed_prefix_list_version` - Restores the entries from a previous version of a managed prefix list to a new version of the prefix list.
* `get_revoke_client_vpn_ingress` - Removes an ingress authorization rule from a Client VPN endpoint. 
* `get_send_diagnostic_interrupt` - <p>Sends a diagnostic interrupt to the specified Amazon EC2 instance to trigger a <i>kernel panic</i> (on Linux instances), or a <i>blue screen</i>/<i>stop error</i> (on Windows instances). For instances based on Intel and AMD processors, the interrupt is received as a <i>non-maskable interrupt</i> (NMI).</p> <p>In general, the operating system crashes and reboots when a kernel panic or stop error is triggered. The operating system can also be configured to perform diagnostic tasks, such as generating a memory dump file, loading a secondary kernel, or obtaining a call trace.</p> <p>Before sending a diagnostic interrupt to your instance, ensure that its operating system is configured to perform the required diagnostic tasks.</p> <p>For more information about configuring your operating system to generate a crash dump when a kernel panic or stop error occurs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/diagnostic-interrupt.html">Send a diagnostic interrupt</a> (Linux instances) or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/diagnostic-interrupt.html">Send a Diagnostic Interrupt</a> (Windows instances).</p>
* `get_start_instances` - <p>Starts an Amazon EBS-backed instance that you've previously stopped.</p> <p>Instances that use Amazon EBS volumes as their root devices can be quickly stopped and started. When an instance is stopped, the compute resources are released and you are not billed for instance usage. However, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains and continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. You can restart your instance at any time. Every time you start your instance, Amazon EC2 charges a one-minute minimum for instance usage, and thereafter charges per second for instance usage.</p> <p>Before stopping an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM.</p> <p>Performing this operation on an instance that uses an instance store as its root device returns an error.</p> <p>If you attempt to start a T3 instance with <code>host</code> tenancy and the <code>unlimted</code> CPU credit option, the request fails. The <code>unlimited</code> CPU credit option is not supported on Dedicated Hosts. Before you start the instance, either change its CPU credit option to <code>standard</code>, or change its tenancy to <code>default</code> or <code>dedicated</code>.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html">Stopping instances</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p>
* `get_start_vpc_endpoint_service_private_dns_verification` - <p>Initiates the verification process to prove that the service provider owns the private DNS name domain for the endpoint service.</p> <p>The service provider must successfully perform the verification before the consumer can use the name to access the service.</p> <p>Before the service provider runs this command, they must add a record to the DNS server. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/endpoint-services-dns-validation.html#add-dns-txt-record">Adding a TXT Record to Your Domain's DNS Server </a> in the <i>Amazon VPC User Guide</i>.</p>
* `get_stop_instances` - <p>Stops an Amazon EBS-backed instance.</p> <p>You can use the Stop action to hibernate an instance if the instance is <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Hibernate.html#enabling-hibernation">enabled for hibernation</a> and it meets the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Hibernate.html#hibernating-prerequisites">hibernation prerequisites</a>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Hibernate.html">Hibernate your instance</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p> <p>We don't charge usage for a stopped instance, or data transfer fees; however, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains and continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. Every time you start your instance, Amazon EC2 charges a one-minute minimum for instance usage, and thereafter charges per second for instance usage.</p> <p>You can't stop or hibernate instance store-backed instances. You can't use the Stop action to hibernate Spot Instances, but you can specify that Amazon EC2 should hibernate Spot Instances when they are interrupted. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-interruptions.html#hibernate-spot-instances">Hibernating interrupted Spot Instances</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p> <p>When you stop or hibernate an instance, we shut it down. You can restart your instance at any time. Before stopping or hibernating an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM, but hibernating an instance does preserve data stored in RAM. If an instance cannot hibernate successfully, a normal shutdown occurs.</p> <p>Stopping and hibernating an instance is different to rebooting or terminating it. For example, when you stop or hibernate an instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, the root device and any other devices attached during the instance launch are automatically deleted. For more information about the differences between rebooting, stopping, hibernating, and terminating instances, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html">Instance lifecycle</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p> <p>When you stop an instance, we attempt to shut it down forcibly after a short while. If your instance appears stuck in the stopping state after a period of time, there may be an issue with the underlying host computer. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesStopping.html">Troubleshooting stopping your instance</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p>
* `get_terminate_client_vpn_connections` - Terminates active Client VPN endpoint connections. This action can be used to terminate a specific client connection, or up to five connections established by a specific user.
* `get_terminate_instances` - <p>Shuts down the specified instances. This operation is idempotent; if you terminate an instance more than once, each call succeeds. </p> <p>If you specify multiple instances and the request fails (for example, because of a single incorrect instance ID), none of the instances are terminated.</p> <p>If you terminate multiple instances across multiple Availability Zones, and one or more of the specified instances are enabled for termination protection, the request fails with the following results:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The specified instances that are in the same Availability Zone as the protected instance are not terminated.</p> </li> <li> <p>The specified instances that are in different Availability Zones, where no other specified instances are protected, are successfully terminated.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For example, say you have the following instances:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Instance A: <code>us-east-1a</code>; Not protected</p> </li> <li> <p>Instance B: <code>us-east-1a</code>; Not protected</p> </li> <li> <p>Instance C: <code>us-east-1b</code>; Protected</p> </li> <li> <p>Instance D: <code>us-east-1b</code>; not protected</p> </li> </ul> <p>If you attempt to terminate all of these instances in the same request, the request reports failure with the following results:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Instance A and Instance B are successfully terminated because none of the specified instances in <code>us-east-1a</code> are enabled for termination protection.</p> </li> <li> <p>Instance C and Instance D fail to terminate because at least one of the specified instances in <code>us-east-1b</code> (Instance C) is enabled for termination protection.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Terminated instances remain visible after termination (for approximately one hour).</p> <p>By default, Amazon EC2 deletes all EBS volumes that were attached when the instance launched. Volumes attached after instance launch continue running.</p> <p>You can stop, start, and terminate EBS-backed instances. You can only terminate instance store-backed instances. What happens to an instance differs if you stop it or terminate it. For example, when you stop an instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, any attached EBS volumes with the <code>DeleteOnTermination</code> block device mapping parameter set to <code>true</code> are automatically deleted. For more information about the differences between stopping and terminating instances, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html">Instance lifecycle</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information about troubleshooting, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesShuttingDown.html">Troubleshooting terminating your instance</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p>

* `post_advertise_byoip_cidr` - <p>Advertises an IPv4 or IPv6 address range that is provisioned for use with your Amazon Web Services resources through bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP).</p> <p>You can perform this operation at most once every 10 seconds, even if you specify different address ranges each time.</p> <p>We recommend that you stop advertising the BYOIP CIDR from other locations when you advertise it from Amazon Web Services. To minimize down time, you can configure your Amazon Web Services resources to use an address from a BYOIP CIDR before it is advertised, and then simultaneously stop advertising it from the current location and start advertising it through Amazon Web Services.</p> <p>It can take a few minutes before traffic to the specified addresses starts routing to Amazon Web Services because of BGP propagation delays.</p> <p>To stop advertising the BYOIP CIDR, use <a>WithdrawByoipCidr</a>.</p>
* `post_allocate_address` - <p>Allocates an Elastic IP address to your Amazon Web Services account. After you allocate the Elastic IP address you can associate it with an instance or network interface. After you release an Elastic IP address, it is released to the IP address pool and can be allocated to a different Amazon Web Services account.</p> <p>You can allocate an Elastic IP address from an address pool owned by Amazon Web Services or from an address pool created from a public IPv4 address range that you have brought to Amazon Web Services for use with your Amazon Web Services resources using bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP). For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-byoip.html">Bring Your Own IP Addresses (BYOIP)</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p> <p>[EC2-VPC] If you release an Elastic IP address, you might be able to recover it. You cannot recover an Elastic IP address that you released after it is allocated to another Amazon Web Services account. You cannot recover an Elastic IP address for EC2-Classic. To attempt to recover an Elastic IP address that you released, specify it in this operation.</p> <p>An Elastic IP address is for use either in the EC2-Classic platform or in a VPC. By default, you can allocate 5 Elastic IP addresses for EC2-Classic per Region and 5 Elastic IP addresses for EC2-VPC per Region.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html">Elastic IP Addresses</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can allocate a carrier IP address which is a public IP address from a telecommunication carrier, to a network interface which resides in a subnet in a Wavelength Zone (for example an EC2 instance). </p>

For more information about Elastic IP addresses, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html">Elastic IP Addresses</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p> <p>When you move a secondary private IP address to another network interface, any Elastic IP address that is associated with the IP address is also moved.</p> <p>Remapping an IP address is an asynchronous operation. When you move an IP address from one network interface to another, check <code>network/interfaces/macs/mac/local-ipv4s</code> in the instance metadata to confirm that the remapping is complete.</p> <p>You must specify either the IP addresses or the IP address count in the request.</p> <p>You can optionally use Prefix Delegation on the network interface. You must specify either the IPv4 Prefix Delegation prefixes, or the IPv4 Prefix Delegation count. For information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-prefix-eni.html"> Assigning prefixes to Amazon EC2 network interfaces</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
* `post_associate_address` - <p>Associates an Elastic IP address, or carrier IP address (for instances that are in subnets in Wavelength Zones) with an instance or a network interface. Before you can use an Elastic IP address, you must allocate it to your account.</p> <p>An Elastic IP address is for use in either the EC2-Classic platform or in a VPC. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html">Elastic IP Addresses</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p> <p>[EC2-Classic, VPC in an EC2-VPC-only account] If the Elastic IP address is already associated with a different instance, it is disassociated from that instance and associated with the specified instance. If you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance that has an existing Elastic IP address, the existing address is disassociated from the instance, but remains allocated to your account.</p> <p>[VPC in an EC2-Classic account] If you don't specify a private IP address, the Elastic IP address is associated with the primary IP address. If the Elastic IP address is already associated with a different instance or a network interface, you get an error unless you allow reassociation. You cannot associate an Elastic IP address with an instance or network interface that has an existing Elastic IP address.</p> <p>[Subnets in Wavelength Zones] You can associate an IP address from the telecommunication carrier to the instance or network interface. </p> <p>You cannot associate an Elastic IP address with an interface in a different network border group.</p> <important> <p>This is an idempotent operation. If you perform the operation more than once, Amazon EC2 doesn't return an error, and you may be charged for each time the Elastic IP address is remapped to the same instance. For more information, see the <i>Elastic IP Addresses</i> section of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/">Amazon EC2 Pricing</a>.</p> </important>
* `post_associate_client_vpn_target_network` - <p>Associates a target network with a Client VPN endpoint. A target network is a subnet in a VPC.

You cannot specify the components of the default VPC yourself.</p> <p>If you deleted your previous default VPC, you can create a default VPC. You cannot have more than one default VPC per Region.</p> <p>If your account supports EC2-Classic, you cannot use this action to create a default VPC in a Region that supports EC2-Classic. If you want a default VPC in a Region that supports EC2-Classic, see "I really want a default VPC for my existing EC2 account. Is that possible?" in the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/#Default_VPCs">Default VPCs FAQ</a>.</p>
* `post_create_dhcp_options` - <p>Creates a set of DHCP options for your VPC. After creating the set, you must associate it with the VPC, causing all existing and new instances that you launch in the VPC to use this set of DHCP options. The following are the individual DHCP options you can specify. For more information about the options, see <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2132.txt">RFC 2132</a>.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>domain-name-servers</code> - The IP addresses of up to four domain name servers, or AmazonProvidedDNS. The default DHCP option set specifies AmazonProvidedDNS. If specifying more than one domain name server, specify the IP addresses in a single parameter, separated by commas. To have your instance receive a custom DNS hostname as specified in <code>domain-name</code>, you must set <code>domain-name-servers</code> to a custom DNS server.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>domain-name</code> - If you're using AmazonProvidedDNS in <code>us-east-1</code>, specify <code>ec2.internal</code>. If you're using AmazonProvidedDNS in another Region, specify <code>region.compute.internal</code> (for example, <code>ap-northeast-1.compute.internal</code>). Otherwise, specify a domain name (for example, <code>ExampleCompany.com</code>). This value is used to complete unqualified DNS hostnames. <b>Important</b>: Some Linux operating systems accept multiple domain names separated by spaces. However, Windows and other Linux operating systems treat the value as a single domain, which results in unexpected behavior. If your DHCP options set is associated with a VPC that has instances with multiple operating systems, specify only one domain name.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ntp-servers</code> - The IP addresses of up to four Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>netbios-name-servers</code> - The IP addresses of up to four NetBIOS name servers.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>netbios-node-type</code> - The NetBIOS node type (1, 2, 4, or 8). We recommend that you specify 2 (broadcast and multicast are not currently supported). For more information about these node types, see <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2132.txt">RFC 2132</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Your VPC automatically starts out with a set of DHCP options that includes only a DNS server that we provide (AmazonProvidedDNS). If you create a set of options, and if your VPC has an internet gateway, make sure to set the <code>domain-name-servers</code> option either to <code>AmazonProvidedDNS</code> or to a domain name server of your choice. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html">DHCP options sets</a> in the <i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>

Convertible Reserved Instances cannot be sold.</p> </note> <p>The Reserved Instance Marketplace matches sellers who want to resell Standard Reserved Instance capacity that they no longer need with buyers who want to purchase additional capacity. Reserved Instances bought and sold through the Reserved Instance Marketplace work like any other Reserved Instances.</p> <p>To sell your Standard Reserved Instances, you must first register as a seller in the Reserved Instance Marketplace. After completing the registration process, you can create a Reserved Instance Marketplace listing of some or all of your Standard Reserved Instances, and specify the upfront price to receive for them. Your Standard Reserved Instance listings then become available for purchase. To view the details of your Standard Reserved Instance listing, you can use the <a>DescribeReservedInstancesListings</a> operation.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ri-market-general.html">Reserved Instance Marketplace</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p>
* `post_create_restore_image_task` - <p>Starts a task that restores an AMI from an Amazon S3 object that was previously created by using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateStoreImageTask.html">CreateStoreImageTask</a>.</p> <p>To use this API, you must have the required permissions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ami-store-restore.html#ami-s3-permissions">Permissions for storing and restoring AMIs using Amazon S3</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ami-store-restore.html">Store and restore an AMI using Amazon S3</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
* `post_create_route` - <p>Creates a route in a route table within a VPC.</p> <p>You must specify one of the following targets: internet gateway or virtual private gateway, NAT instance, NAT gateway, VPC peering connection, network interface, egress-only internet gateway, or transit gateway.</p> <p>When determining how to route traffic, we use the route with the most specific match. For example, traffic is destined for the IPv4 address <code>192.0.2.3</code>, and the route table includes the following two IPv4 routes:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>192.0.2.0/24</code> (goes to some target A)</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>192.0.2.0/28</code> (goes to some target B)</p> </li> </ul> <p>Both routes apply to the traffic destined for <code>192.0.2.3</code>. However, the second route in the list covers a smaller number of IP addresses and is therefore more specific, so we use that route to determine where to target the traffic.</p> <p>For more information about route tables, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html">Route tables</a> in the <i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
* `post_create_route_table` - <p>Creates a route table for the specified VPC. After you create a route table, you can add routes and associate the table with a subnet.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html">Route tables</a> in the <i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
* `post_create_security_group` - <p>Creates a security group.</p> <p>A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic.

You can have a security group for use in EC2-Classic with the same name as a security group for use in a VPC. However, you can't have two security groups for use in EC2-Classic with the same name or two security groups for use in a VPC with the same name.</p> <p>You have a default security group for use in EC2-Classic and a default security group for use in your VPC. If you don't specify a security group when you launch an instance, the instance is launched into the appropriate default security group. A default security group includes a default rule that grants instances unrestricted network access to each other.</p> <p>You can add or remove rules from your security groups using <a>AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress</a>, <a>AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress</a>, <a>RevokeSecurityGroupIngress</a>, and <a>RevokeSecurityGroupEgress</a>.</p> <p>For more information about VPC security group limits, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html">Amazon VPC Limits</a>.</p>
* `post_create_snapshot` - <p>Creates a snapshot of an EBS volume and stores it in Amazon S3. You can use snapshots for backups, to make copies of EBS volumes, and to save data before shutting down an instance.</p> <p>You can create snapshots of volumes in a Region and volumes on an Outpost. If you create a snapshot of a volume in a Region, the snapshot must be stored in the same Region as the volume. If you create a snapshot of a volume on an Outpost, the snapshot can be stored on the same Outpost as the volume, or in the Region for that Outpost.</p> <p>When a snapshot is created, any Amazon Web Services Marketplace product codes that are associated with the source volume are propagated to the snapshot.</p> <p>You can take a snapshot of an attached volume that is in use. However, snapshots only capture data that has been written to your Amazon EBS volume at the time the snapshot command is issued; this might exclude any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating system. If you can pause any file systems on the volume long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete. However, if you cannot pause all file writes to the volume, you should unmount the volume from within the instance, issue the snapshot command, and then remount the volume to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount and use your volume while the snapshot status is <code>pending</code>.</p> <p>To create a snapshot for Amazon EBS volumes that serve as root devices, you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot.</p> <p>Snapshots that are taken from encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted. Volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are also automatically encrypted. Your encrypted volumes and any associated snapshots always remain protected.</p> <p>You can tag your snapshots during creation. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html">Tag your Amazon EC2 resources</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html">Amazon Elastic Block Store</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html">Amazon EBS encryption</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
* `post_create_snapshots` - <p>Creates crash-consistent snapshots of multiple EBS volumes and stores the data in S3. Volumes are chosen by specifying an instance. Any attached volumes will produce one snapshot each that is crash-consistent across the instance. Boot volumes can be excluded by changing the parameters. </p> <p>You can create multi-volume snapshots of instances in a Region and instances on an Outpost. If you create snapshots from an instance in a Region, the snapshots must be stored in the same Region as the instance. If you create snapshots from an instance on an Outpost, the snapshots can be stored on the same Outpost as the instance, or in the Region for that Outpost.</p>
* `post_create_spot_datafeed_subscription` - Creates a data feed for Spot Instances, enabling you to view Spot Instance usage logs. You can create one data feed per Amazon Web Services account.

* `post_create_subnet` - <p>Creates a subnet in a specified VPC.</p> <p>You must specify an IPv4 CIDR block for the subnet. After you create a subnet, you can't change its CIDR block. The allowed block size is between a /16 netmask (65,536 IP addresses) and /28 netmask (16 IP addresses). The CIDR block must not overlap with the CIDR block of an existing subnet in the VPC.</p> <p>If you've associated an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC, you can create a subnet with an IPv6 CIDR block that uses a /64 prefix length. </p> <important> <p>Amazon Web Services reserves both the first four and the last IPv4 address in each subnet's CIDR block. They're not available for use.</p> </important> <p>If you add more than one subnet to a VPC, they're set up in a star topology with a logical router in the middle.</p> <p>When you stop an instance in a subnet, it retains its private IPv4 address. It's therefore possible to have a subnet with no running instances (they're all stopped), but no remaining IP addresses available.</p> <p>For more information about subnets, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html">Your VPC and subnets</a> in the <i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>

For more information about volume status, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-volume-status.html">Monitor the status of your volumes</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <i>Events</i>: Reflect the cause of a volume status and might require you to take action. For example, if your volume returns an <code>impaired</code> status, then the volume event might be <code>potential-data-inconsistency</code>. This means that your volume has been affected by an issue with the underlying host, has all I/O operations disabled, and might have inconsistent data.</p> <p> <i>Actions</i>: Reflect the actions you might have to take in response to an event. For example, if the status of the volume is <code>impaired</code> and the volume event shows <code>potential-data-inconsistency</code>, then the action shows <code>enable-volume-io</code>. This means that you may want to enable the I/O operations for the volume by calling the <a>EnableVolumeIO</a> action and then check the volume for data consistency.</p> <p>Volume status is based on the volume status checks, and does not reflect the volume state. Therefore, volume status does not indicate volumes in the <code>error</code> state (for example, when a volume is incapable of accepting I/O.)</p>

* `post_modify_availability_zone_group` - <p>Changes the opt-in status of the Local Zone and Wavelength Zone group for your account.</p> <p>Use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAvailabilityZones.html"> DescribeAvailabilityZones</a> to view the value for <code>GroupName</code>.</p>
* `post_modify_capacity_reservation` - Modifies a Capacity Reservation's capacity and the conditions under which it is to be released. You cannot change a Capacity Reservation's instance type, EBS optimization, instance store settings, platform, Availability Zone, or instance eligibility. If you need to modify any of these attributes, we recommend that you cancel the Capacity Reservation, and then create a new one with the required attributes.
* `post_modify_client_vpn_endpoint` - Modifies the specified Client VPN endpoint. Modifying the DNS server resets existing client connections.
* `post_modify_default_credit_specification` - <p>Modifies the default credit option for CPU usage of burstable performance instances. The default credit option is set at the account level per Amazon Web Services Region, and is specified per instance family. All new burstable performance instances in the account launch using the default credit option.</p> <p> <code>ModifyDefaultCreditSpecification</code> is an asynchronous operation, which works at an Amazon Web Services Region level and modifies the credit option for each Availability Zone. All zones in a Region are updated within five minutes. But if instances are launched during this operation, they might not get the new credit option until the zone is updated. To verify whether the update has occurred, you can call <code>GetDefaultCreditSpecification</code> and check <code>DefaultCreditSpecification</code> for updates.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html">Burstable performance instances</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p>
* `post_modify_ebs_default_kms_key_id` - <p>Changes the default KMS key for EBS encryption by default for your account in this Region.</p> <p>Amazon Web Services creates a unique Amazon Web Services managed KMS key in each Region for use with encryption by default. If you change the default KMS key to a symmetric customer managed KMS key, it is used instead of the Amazon Web Services managed KMS key. To reset the default KMS key to the Amazon Web Services managed KMS key for EBS, use <a>ResetEbsDefaultKmsKeyId</a>. Amazon EBS does not support asymmetric KMS keys.</p> <p>If you delete or disable the customer managed KMS key that you specified for use with encryption by default, your instances will fail to launch.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html">Amazon EBS encryption</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
* `post_modify_fleet` - <p>Modifies the specified EC2 Fleet.</p> <p>You can only modify an EC2 Fleet request of type <code>maintain</code>.</p> <p>While the EC2 Fleet is being modified, it is in the <code>modifying</code> state.</p> <p>To scale up your EC2 Fleet, increase its target capacity. The EC2 Fleet launches the additional Spot Instances according to the allocation strategy for the EC2 Fleet request. If the allocation strategy is <code>lowest-price</code>, the EC2 Fleet launches instances using the Spot Instance pool with the lowest price. If the allocation strategy is <code>diversified</code>, the EC2 Fleet distributes the instances across the Spot Instance pools. If the allocation strategy is <code>capacity-optimized</code>, EC2 Fleet launches instances from Spot Instance pools with optimal capacity for the number of instances that are launching.</p> <p>To scale down your EC2 Fleet, decrease its target capacity. First, the EC2 Fleet cancels any open requests that exceed the new target capacity. You can request that the EC2 Fleet terminate Spot Instances until the size of the fleet no longer exceeds the new target capacity. If the allocation strategy is <code>lowest-price</code>, the EC2 Fleet terminates the instances with the highest price per unit. If the allocation strategy is <code>capacity-optimized</code>, the EC2 Fleet terminates the instances in the Spot Instance pools that have the least available Spot Instance capacity. If the allocation strategy is <code>diversified</code>, the EC2 Fleet terminates instances across the Spot Instance pools. Alternatively, you can request that the EC2 Fleet keep the fleet at its current size, but not replace any Spot Instances that are interrupted or that you terminate manually.</p> <p>If you are finished with your EC2 Fleet for now, but will use it again later, you can set the target capacity to 0.</p>
* `post_modify_fpga_image_attribute` - Modifies the specified attribute of the specified Amazon FPGA Image (AFI).
* `post_modify_hosts` - <p>Modify the auto-placement setting of a Dedicated Host. When auto-placement is enabled, any instances that you launch with a tenancy of <code>host</code> but without a specific host ID are placed onto any available Dedicated Host in your account that has auto-placement enabled. When auto-placement is disabled, you need to provide a host ID to have the instance launch onto a specific host. If no host ID is provided, the instance is launched onto a suitable host with auto-placement enabled.</p> <p>You can also use this API action to modify a Dedicated Host to support either multiple instance types in an instance family, or to support a specific instance type only.</p>
* `post_modify_id_format` - <p>Modifies the ID format for the specified resource on a per-Region basis.

* `post_modify_transit_gateway_vpc_attachment` - Modifies the specified VPC attachment.
* `post_modify_volume` - <p>You can modify several parameters of an existing EBS volume, including volume size, volume type, and IOPS capacity. If your EBS volume is attached to a current-generation EC2 instance type, you might be able to apply these changes without stopping the instance or detaching the volume from it. For more information about modifying EBS volumes, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-modify-volume.html">Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes</a> (Linux instances) or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ebs-modify-volume.html">Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes</a> (Windows instances).</p> <p>When you complete a resize operation on your volume, you need to extend the volume's file-system size to take advantage of the new storage capacity. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html#recognize-expanded-volume-linux">Extend a Linux file system</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html#recognize-expanded-volume-windows">Extend a Windows file system</a>.</p> <p> You can use CloudWatch Events to check the status of a modification to an EBS volume. For information about CloudWatch Events, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/">Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide</a>. You can also track the status of a modification using <a>DescribeVolumesModifications</a>. For information about tracking status changes using either method, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-volume-modifications.html">Monitor the progress of volume modifications</a>.</p> <p>With previous-generation instance types, resizing an EBS volume might require detaching and reattaching the volume or stopping and restarting the instance.</p> <p>If you reach the maximum volume modification rate per volume limit, you must wait at least six hours before applying further modifications to the affected EBS volume.</p>
* `post_modify_volume_attribute` - <p>Modifies a volume attribute.</p> <p>By default, all I/O operations for the volume are suspended when the data on the volume is determined to be potentially inconsistent, to prevent undetectable, latent data corruption. The I/O access to the volume can be resumed by first enabling I/O access and then checking the data consistency on your volume.</p> <p>You can change the default behavior to resume I/O operations. We recommend that you change this only for boot volumes or for volumes that are stateless or disposable.</p>
* `post_modify_vpc_attribute` - Modifies the specified attribute of the specified VPC.
* `post_modify_vpc_endpoint` - Modifies attributes of a specified VPC endpoint. The attributes that you can modify depend on the type of VPC endpoint (interface, gateway, or Gateway Load Balancer). For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html">VPC Endpoints</a> in the <i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>.

* `post_modify_vpc_endpoint_service_configuration` - <p>Modifies the attributes of your VPC endpoint service configuration. You can change the Network Load Balancers or Gateway Load Balancers for your service, and you can specify whether acceptance is required for requests to connect to your endpoint service through an interface VPC endpoint.</p> <p>If you set or modify the private DNS name, you must prove that you own the private DNS domain name. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/endpoint-services-dns-validation.html">VPC Endpoint Service Private DNS Name Verification</a> in the <i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
* `post_modify_vpc_endpoint_service_permissions` - <p>Modifies the permissions for your <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/endpoint-service.html">VPC endpoint service</a>. You can add or remove permissions for service consumers (IAM users, IAM roles, and AWS accounts) to connect to your endpoint service.</p> <p>If you grant permissions to all principals, the service is public. Any users who know the name of a public service can send a request to attach an endpoint. If the service does not require manual approval, attachments are automatically approved.</p>
* `post_modify_vpc_peering_connection_options` - <p>Modifies the VPC peering connection options on one side of a VPC peering connection. You can do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Enable/disable communication over the peering connection between an EC2-Classic instance that's linked to your VPC (using ClassicLink) and instances in the peer VPC.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enable/disable communication over the peering connection between instances in your VPC and an EC2-Classic instance that's linked to the peer VPC.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enable/disable the ability to resolve public DNS hostnames to private IP addresses when queried from instances in the peer VPC.</p> </li> </ul> <p>If the peered VPCs are in the same Amazon Web Services account, you can enable DNS resolution for queries from the local VPC. This ensures that queries from the local VPC resolve to private IP addresses in the peer VPC. This option is not available if the peered VPCs are in different different Amazon Web Services accounts or different Regions. For peered VPCs in different Amazon Web Services accounts, each Amazon Web Services account owner must initiate a separate request to modify the peering connection options. For inter-region peering connections, you must use the Region for the requester VPC to modify the requester VPC peering options and the Region for the accepter VPC to modify the accepter VPC peering options. To verify which VPCs are the accepter and the requester for a VPC peering connection, use the <a>DescribeVpcPeeringConnections</a> command.</p>
* `post_modify_vpc_tenancy` - <p>Modifies the instance tenancy attribute of the specified VPC. You can change the instance tenancy attribute of a VPC to <code>default</code> only. You cannot change the instance tenancy attribute to <code>dedicated</code>.</p> <p>After you modify the tenancy of the VPC, any new instances that you launch into the VPC have a tenancy of <code>default</code>, unless you specify otherwise during launch. The tenancy of any existing instances in the VPC is not affected.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-instance.html">Dedicated Instances</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
* `post_modify_vpn_connection` - <p>Modifies the customer gateway or the target gateway of an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. To modify the target gateway, the following migration options are available:</p> <ul> <li> <p>An existing virtual private gateway to a new virtual private gateway</p> </li> <li> <p>An existing virtual private gateway to a transit gateway</p> </li> <li> <p>An existing transit gateway to a new transit gateway</p> </li> <li> <p>An existing transit gateway to a virtual private gateway</p> </li> </ul> <p>Before you perform the migration to the new gateway, you must configure the new gateway. Use <a>CreateVpnGateway</a> to create a virtual private gateway, or <a>CreateTransitGateway</a> to create a transit gateway.</p> <p>This step is required when you migrate from a virtual private gateway with static routes to a transit gateway. </p> <p>You must delete the static routes before you migrate to the new gateway.</p> <p>Keep a copy of the static route before you delete it. You will need to add back these routes to the transit gateway after the VPN connection migration is complete.</p> <p>After you migrate to the new gateway, you might need to modify your VPC route table. Use <a>CreateRoute</a> and <a>DeleteRoute</a> to make the changes described in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/modify-vpn-target.html#step-update-routing">VPN Gateway Target Modification Required VPC Route Table Updates</a> in the <i>AWS Site-to-Site VPN User Guide</i>.</p> <p> When the new gateway is a transit gateway, modify the transit gateway route table to allow traffic between the VPC and the AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. Use <a>CreateTransitGatewayRoute</a> to add the routes.</p> <p> If you deleted VPN static routes, you must add the static routes to the transit gateway route table.</p> <p>After you perform this operation, the AWS VPN endpoint's IP addresses on the AWS side and the tunnel options remain intact. Your AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection will be temporarily unavailable for a brief period while we provision the new endpoints.</p>
* `post_modify_vpn_connection_options` - <p>Modifies the connection options for your Site-to-Site VPN connection.</p> <p>When you modify the VPN connection options, the VPN endpoint IP addresses on the AWS side do not change, and the tunnel options do not change. Your VPN connection will be temporarily unavailable for a brief period while the VPN connection is updated.</p>
* `post_modify_vpn_tunnel_certificate` - Modifies the VPN tunnel endpoint certificate.
* `post_modify_vpn_tunnel_options` - Modifies the options for a VPN tunnel in an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. You can modify multiple options for a tunnel in a single request, but you can only modify one tunnel at a time. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPNTunnels.html">Site-to-Site VPN Tunnel Options for Your Site-to-Site VPN Connection</a> in the <i>AWS Site-to-Site VPN User Guide</i>.
* `post_monitor_instances` - <p>Enables detailed monitoring for a running instance. Otherwise, basic monitoring is enabled.

* `post_move_address_to_vpc` - Moves an Elastic IP address from the EC2-Classic platform to the EC2-VPC platform. The Elastic IP address must be allocated to your account for more than 24 hours, and it must not be associated with an instance. After the Elastic IP address is moved, it is no longer available for use in the EC2-Classic platform, unless you move it back using the <a>RestoreAddressToClassic</a> request. You cannot move an Elastic IP address that was originally allocated for use in the EC2-VPC platform to the EC2-Classic platform. 
* `post_provision_byoip_cidr` - <p>Provisions an IPv4 or IPv6 address range for use with your Amazon Web Services resources through bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) and creates a corresponding address pool. After the address range is provisioned, it is ready to be advertised using <a>AdvertiseByoipCidr</a>.</p> <p>Amazon Web Services verifies that you own the address range and are authorized to advertise it. You must ensure that the address range is registered to you and that you created an RPKI ROA to authorize Amazon ASNs 16509 and 14618 to advertise the address range. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-byoip.html">Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP)</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Provisioning an address range is an asynchronous operation, so the call returns immediately, but the address range is not ready to use until its status changes from <code>pending-provision</code> to <code>provisioned</code>. To monitor the status of an address range, use <a>DescribeByoipCidrs</a>. To allocate an Elastic IP address from your IPv4 address pool, use <a>AllocateAddress</a> with either the specific address from the address pool or the ID of the address pool.</p>
* `post_purchase_host_reservation` - Purchase a reservation with configurations that match those of your Dedicated Host. You must have active Dedicated Hosts in your account before you purchase a reservation. This action results in the specified reservation being purchased and charged to your account.
* `post_purchase_reserved_instances_offering` - <p>Purchases a Reserved Instance for use with your account. With Reserved Instances, you pay a lower hourly rate compared to On-Demand instance pricing.</p> <p>Use <a>DescribeReservedInstancesOfferings</a> to get a list of Reserved Instance offerings that match your specifications. After you've purchased a Reserved Instance, you can check for your new Reserved Instance with <a>DescribeReservedInstances</a>.</p> <p>To queue a purchase for a future date and time, specify a purchase time. If you do not specify a purchase time, the default is the current time.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts-on-demand-reserved-instances.html">Reserved Instances</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ri-market-general.html">Reserved Instance Marketplace</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p>
* `post_purchase_scheduled_instances` - <p>Purchases the Scheduled Instances with the specified schedule.</p> <p>Scheduled Instances enable you to purchase Amazon EC2 compute capacity by the hour for a one-year term. Before you can purchase a Scheduled Instance, you must call <a>DescribeScheduledInstanceAvailability</a> to check for available schedules and obtain a purchase token. After you purchase a Scheduled Instance, you must call <a>RunScheduledInstances</a> during each scheduled time period.</p> <p>After you purchase a Scheduled Instance, you can't cancel, modify, or resell your purchase.</p>
* `post_reboot_instances` - <p>Requests a reboot of the specified instances. This operation is asynchronous; it only queues a request to reboot the specified instances. The operation succeeds if the instances are valid and belong to you. Requests to reboot terminated instances are ignored.</p> <p>If an instance does not cleanly shut down within a few minutes, Amazon EC2 performs a hard reboot.</p> <p>For more information about troubleshooting, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-console.html">Getting console output and rebooting instances</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p>
* `post_register_image` - <p>Registers an AMI. When you're creating an AMI, this is the final step you must complete before you can launch an instance from the AMI. For more information about creating AMIs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami.html">Creating your own AMIs</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>For Amazon EBS-backed instances, <a>CreateImage</a> creates and registers the AMI in a single request, so you don't have to register the AMI yourself.</p> </note> <p>If needed, you can deregister an AMI at any time. Any modifications you make to an AMI backed by an instance store volume invalidates its registration. If you make changes to an image, deregister the previous image and register the new image.</p> <p> <b>Register a snapshot of a root device volume</b> </p> <p>You can use <code>RegisterImage</code> to create an Amazon EBS-backed Linux AMI from a snapshot of a root device volume. You specify the snapshot using a block device mapping. You can't set the encryption state of the volume using the block device mapping. If the snapshot is encrypted, or encryption by default is enabled, the root volume of an instance launched from the AMI is encrypted.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-ebs.html#creating-launching-ami-from-snapshot">Create a Linux AMI from a snapshot</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIEncryption.html">Use encryption with Amazon EBS-backed AMIs</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Amazon Web Services Marketplace product codes</b> </p> <p>If any snapshots have Amazon Web Services Marketplace product codes, they are copied to the new AMI.</p> <p>Windows and some Linux distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), use the Amazon EC2 billing product code associated with an AMI to verify the subscription status for package updates. To create a new AMI for operating systems that require a billing product code, instead of registering the AMI, do the following to preserve the billing product code association:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Launch an instance from an existing AMI with that billing product code.</p> </li> <li> <p>Customize the instance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create an AMI from the instance using <a>CreateImage</a>.</p> </li> </ol> <p>If you purchase a Reserved Instance to apply to an On-Demand Instance that was launched from an AMI with a billing product code, make sure that the Reserved Instance has the matching billing product code. If you purchase a Reserved Instance without the matching billing product code, the Reserved Instance will not be applied to the On-Demand Instance. For information about how to obtain the platform details and billing information of an AMI, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ami-billing-info.html">Understanding AMI billing</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
* `post_register_instance_event_notification_attributes` - <p>Registers a set of tag keys to include in scheduled event notifications for your resources. </p> <p>To remove tags, use .</p>
* `post_register_transit_gateway_multicast_group_members` - <p>Registers members (network interfaces) with the transit gateway multicast group. A member is a network interface associated with a supported EC2 instance that receives multicast traffic. For information about supported instances, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/transit-gateway-limits.html#multicast-limits">Multicast Consideration</a> in <i>Amazon VPC Transit Gateways</i>.</p> <p>After you add the members, use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_SearchTransitGatewayMulticastGroups.html">SearchTransitGatewayMulticastGroups</a> to verify that the members were added to the transit gateway multicast group.</p>
* `post_register_transit_gateway_multicast_group_sources` - <p>Registers sources (network interfaces) with the specified transit gateway multicast group.</p> <p>A multicast source is a network interface attached to a supported instance that sends multicast traffic. For information about supported instances, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/transit-gateway-limits.html#multicast-limits">Multicast Considerations</a> in <i>Amazon VPC Transit Gateways</i>.</p> <p>After you add the source, use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_SearchTransitGatewayMulticastGroups.html">SearchTransitGatewayMulticastGroups</a> to verify that the source was added to the multicast group.</p>

* `post_reject_transit_gateway_vpc_attachment` - <p>Rejects a request to attach a VPC to a transit gateway.</p> <p>The VPC attachment must be in the <code>pendingAcceptance</code> state. Use <a>DescribeTransitGatewayVpcAttachments</a> to view your pending VPC attachment requests. Use <a>AcceptTransitGatewayVpcAttachment</a> to accept a VPC attachment request.</p>
* `post_reject_vpc_endpoint_connections` - Rejects one or more VPC endpoint connection requests to your VPC endpoint service.
* `post_reject_vpc_peering_connection` - Rejects a VPC peering connection request. The VPC peering connection must be in the <code>pending-acceptance</code> state. Use the <a>DescribeVpcPeeringConnections</a> request to view your outstanding VPC peering connection requests. To delete an active VPC peering connection, or to delete a VPC peering connection request that you initiated, use <a>DeleteVpcPeeringConnection</a>.
* `post_release_address` - <p>Releases the specified Elastic IP address.</p> <p>[EC2-Classic, default VPC] Releasing an Elastic IP address automatically disassociates it from any instance that it's associated with. To disassociate an Elastic IP address without releasing it, use <a>DisassociateAddress</a>.</p> <p>[Nondefault VPC] You must use <a>DisassociateAddress</a> to disassociate the Elastic IP address before you can release it. Otherwise, Amazon EC2 returns an error (<code>InvalidIPAddress.InUse</code>).</p> <p>After releasing an Elastic IP address, it is released to the IP address pool. Be sure to update your DNS records and any servers or devices that communicate with the address. If you attempt to release an Elastic IP address that you already released, you'll get an <code>AuthFailure</code> error if the address is already allocated to another Amazon Web Services account.</p> <p>[EC2-VPC] After you release an Elastic IP address for use in a VPC, you might be able to recover it. For more information, see <a>AllocateAddress</a>.</p>
* `post_release_hosts` - <p>When you no longer want to use an On-Demand Dedicated Host it can be released. On-Demand billing is stopped and the host goes into <code>released</code> state. The host ID of Dedicated Hosts that have been released can no longer be specified in another request, for example, to modify the host. You must stop or terminate all instances on a host before it can be released.</p> <p>When Dedicated Hosts are released, it may take some time for them to stop counting toward your limit and you may receive capacity errors when trying to allocate new Dedicated Hosts. Wait a few minutes and then try again.</p> <p>Released hosts still appear in a <a>DescribeHosts</a> response.</p>
* `post_replace_iam_instance_profile_association` - <p>Replaces an IAM instance profile for the specified running instance. You can use this action to change the IAM instance profile that's associated with an instance without having to disassociate the existing IAM instance profile first.</p> <p>Use <a>DescribeIamInstanceProfileAssociations</a> to get the association ID.</p>
* `post_replace_network_acl_association` - <p>Changes which network ACL a subnet is associated with. By default when you create a subnet, it's automatically associated with the default network ACL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_ACLs.html">Network ACLs</a> in the <i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>.</p> <p>This is an idempotent operation.</p>
* `post_replace_network_acl_entry` - Replaces an entry (rule) in a network ACL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_ACLs.html">Network ACLs</a> in the <i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>.
* `post_replace_route` - <p>Replaces an existing route within a route table in a VPC. You must provide only one of the following: internet gateway, virtual private gateway, NAT instance, NAT gateway, VPC peering connection, network interface, egress-only internet gateway, or transit gateway.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html">Route tables</a> in the <i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
* `post_replace_route_table_association` - <p>Changes the route table associated with a given subnet, internet gateway, or virtual private gateway in a VPC. After the operation completes, the subnet or gateway uses the routes in the new route table. For more information about route tables, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html">Route tables</a> in the <i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can also use this operation to change which table is the main route table in the VPC. Specify the main route table's association ID and the route table ID of the new main route table.</p>
* `post_replace_transit_gateway_route` - Replaces the specified route in the specified transit gateway route table.
* `post_report_instance_status` - <p>Submits feedback about the status of an instance. The instance must be in the <code>running</code> state. If your experience with the instance differs from the instance status returned by <a>DescribeInstanceStatus</a>, use <a>ReportInstanceStatus</a> to report your experience with the instance. Amazon EC2 collects this information to improve the accuracy of status checks.</p> <p>Use of this action does not change the value returned by <a>DescribeInstanceStatus</a>.</p>
* `post_request_spot_fleet` - <p>Creates a Spot Fleet request.</p> <p>The Spot Fleet request specifies the total target capacity and the On-Demand target capacity. Amazon EC2 calculates the difference between the total capacity and On-Demand capacity, and launches the difference as Spot capacity.</p> <p>You can submit a single request that includes multiple launch specifications that vary by instance type, AMI, Availability Zone, or subnet.</p> <p>By default, the Spot Fleet requests Spot Instances in the Spot Instance pool where the price per unit is the lowest. Each launch specification can include its own instance weighting that reflects the value of the instance type to your application workload.</p> <p>Alternatively, you can specify that the Spot Fleet distribute the target capacity across the Spot pools included in its launch specifications. By ensuring that the Spot Instances in your Spot Fleet are in different Spot pools, you can improve the availability of your fleet.</p> <p>You can specify tags for the Spot Fleet request and instances launched by the fleet. You cannot tag other resource types in a Spot Fleet request because only the <code>spot-fleet-request</code> and <code>instance</code> resource types are supported.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet-requests.html">Spot Fleet requests</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances</i>.</p>
* `post_request_spot_instances` - <p>Creates a Spot Instance request.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-requests.html">Spot Instance requests</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances</i>.</p>

* `post_restore_address_to_classic` - Restores an Elastic IP address that was previously moved to the EC2-VPC platform back to the EC2-Classic platform. You cannot move an Elastic IP address that was originally allocated for use in EC2-VPC. The Elastic IP address must not be associated with an instance or network interface.
* `post_restore_managed_prefix_list_version` - Restores the entries from a previous version of a managed prefix list to a new version of the prefix list.
* `post_revoke_client_vpn_ingress` - Removes an ingress authorization rule from a Client VPN endpoint. 
* `post_revoke_security_group_egress` - <p>[VPC only] Removes the specified outbound (egress) rules from a security group for EC2-VPC. This action does not apply to security groups for use in EC2-Classic.</p> <p>You can specify rules using either rule IDs or security group rule properties. If you use rule properties, the values that you specify (for example, ports) must match the existing rule's values exactly. Each rule has a protocol, from and to ports, and destination (CIDR range, security group, or prefix list). For the TCP and UDP protocols, you must also specify the destination port or range of ports. For the ICMP protocol, you must also specify the ICMP type and code. If the security group rule has a description, you do not need to specify the description to revoke the rule.</p> <p>[Default VPC] If the values you specify do not match the existing rule's values, no error is returned, and the output describes the security group rules that were not revoked.</p> <p>Amazon Web Services recommends that you describe the security group to verify that the rules were removed.</p> <p>Rule changes are propagated to instances within the security group as quickly as possible. However, a small delay might occur.</p>
* `post_revoke_security_group_ingress` - <p>Removes the specified inbound (ingress) rules from a security group.</p> <p>You can specify rules using either rule IDs or security group rule properties. If you use rule properties, the values that you specify (for example, ports) must match the existing rule's values exactly. Each rule has a protocol, from and to ports, and source (CIDR range, security group, or prefix list). For the TCP and UDP protocols, you must also specify the destination port or range of ports. For the ICMP protocol, you must also specify the ICMP type and code. If the security group rule has a description, you do not need to specify the description to revoke the rule.</p> <p>[EC2-Classic, default VPC] If the values you specify do not match the existing rule's values, no error is returned, and the output describes the security group rules that were not revoked.</p> <p>Amazon Web Services recommends that you describe the security group to verify that the rules were removed.</p> <p>Rule changes are propagated to instances within the security group as quickly as possible. However, a small delay might occur.</p>
* `post_run_instances` - <p>Launches the specified number of instances using an AMI for which you have permissions.</p> <p>You can specify a number of options, or leave the default options. The following rules apply:</p> <ul> <li> <p>[EC2-VPC] If you don't specify a subnet ID, we choose a default subnet from your default VPC for you. If you don't have a default VPC, you must specify a subnet ID in the request.</p> </li> <li> <p>[EC2-Classic] If don't specify an Availability Zone, we choose one for you.</p> </li> <li> <p>Some instance types must be launched into a VPC. If you do not have a default VPC, or if you do not specify a subnet ID, the request fails. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-vpc.html#vpc-only-instance-types">Instance types available only in a VPC</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>[EC2-VPC] All instances have a network interface with a primary private IPv4 address. If you don't specify this address, we choose one from the IPv4 range of your subnet.</p> </li> <li> <p>Not all instance types support IPv6 addresses. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html">Instance types</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you don't specify a security group ID, we use the default security group. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html">Security groups</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>If any of the AMIs have a product code attached for which the user has not subscribed, the request fails.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can create a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html">launch template</a>, which is a resource that contains the parameters to launch an instance. When you launch an instance using <a>RunInstances</a>, you can specify the launch template instead of specifying the launch parameters.</p> <p>To ensure faster instance launches, break up large requests into smaller batches. For example, create five separate launch requests for 100 instances each instead of one launch request for 500 instances.</p> <p>An instance is ready for you to use when it's in the <code>running</code> state. You can check the state of your instance using <a>DescribeInstances</a>. You can tag instances and EBS volumes during launch, after launch, or both. For more information, see <a>CreateTags</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html">Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources</a>.</p> <p>Linux instances have access to the public key of the key pair at boot. You can use this key to provide secure access to the instance. Amazon EC2 public images use this feature to provide secure access without passwords.

* `post_run_scheduled_instances` - <p>Launches the specified Scheduled Instances.</p> <p>Before you can launch a Scheduled Instance, you must purchase it and obtain an identifier using <a>PurchaseScheduledInstances</a>.</p> <p>You must launch a Scheduled Instance during its scheduled time period. You can't stop or reboot a Scheduled Instance, but you can terminate it as needed. If you terminate a Scheduled Instance before the current scheduled time period ends, you can launch it again after a few minutes. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-scheduled-instances.html">Scheduled Instances</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p>
* `post_search_local_gateway_routes` - Searches for routes in the specified local gateway route table.
* `post_search_transit_gateway_multicast_groups` - Searches one or more transit gateway multicast groups and returns the group membership information.
* `post_search_transit_gateway_routes` - Searches for routes in the specified transit gateway route table.
* `post_send_diagnostic_interrupt` - <p>Sends a diagnostic interrupt to the specified Amazon EC2 instance to trigger a <i>kernel panic</i> (on Linux instances), or a <i>blue screen</i>/<i>stop error</i> (on Windows instances). For instances based on Intel and AMD processors, the interrupt is received as a <i>non-maskable interrupt</i> (NMI).</p> <p>In general, the operating system crashes and reboots when a kernel panic or stop error is triggered. The operating system can also be configured to perform diagnostic tasks, such as generating a memory dump file, loading a secondary kernel, or obtaining a call trace.</p> <p>Before sending a diagnostic interrupt to your instance, ensure that its operating system is configured to perform the required diagnostic tasks.</p> <p>For more information about configuring your operating system to generate a crash dump when a kernel panic or stop error occurs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/diagnostic-interrupt.html">Send a diagnostic interrupt</a> (Linux instances) or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/diagnostic-interrupt.html">Send a Diagnostic Interrupt</a> (Windows instances).</p>
* `post_start_instances` - <p>Starts an Amazon EBS-backed instance that you've previously stopped.</p> <p>Instances that use Amazon EBS volumes as their root devices can be quickly stopped and started. When an instance is stopped, the compute resources are released and you are not billed for instance usage. However, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains and continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. You can restart your instance at any time. Every time you start your instance, Amazon EC2 charges a one-minute minimum for instance usage, and thereafter charges per second for instance usage.</p> <p>Before stopping an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM.</p> <p>Performing this operation on an instance that uses an instance store as its root device returns an error.</p> <p>If you attempt to start a T3 instance with <code>host</code> tenancy and the <code>unlimted</code> CPU credit option, the request fails. The <code>unlimited</code> CPU credit option is not supported on Dedicated Hosts. Before you start the instance, either change its CPU credit option to <code>standard</code>, or change its tenancy to <code>default</code> or <code>dedicated</code>.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html">Stopping instances</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p>
* `post_start_network_insights_analysis` - Starts analyzing the specified path. If the path is reachable, the operation returns the shortest feasible path.
* `post_start_vpc_endpoint_service_private_dns_verification` - <p>Initiates the verification process to prove that the service provider owns the private DNS name domain for the endpoint service.</p> <p>The service provider must successfully perform the verification before the consumer can use the name to access the service.</p> <p>Before the service provider runs this command, they must add a record to the DNS server. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/endpoint-services-dns-validation.html#add-dns-txt-record">Adding a TXT Record to Your Domain's DNS Server </a> in the <i>Amazon VPC User Guide</i>.</p>
* `post_stop_instances` - <p>Stops an Amazon EBS-backed instance.</p> <p>You can use the Stop action to hibernate an instance if the instance is <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Hibernate.html#enabling-hibernation">enabled for hibernation</a> and it meets the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Hibernate.html#hibernating-prerequisites">hibernation prerequisites</a>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Hibernate.html">Hibernate your instance</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p> <p>We don't charge usage for a stopped instance, or data transfer fees; however, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains and continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. Every time you start your instance, Amazon EC2 charges a one-minute minimum for instance usage, and thereafter charges per second for instance usage.</p> <p>You can't stop or hibernate instance store-backed instances. You can't use the Stop action to hibernate Spot Instances, but you can specify that Amazon EC2 should hibernate Spot Instances when they are interrupted. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-interruptions.html#hibernate-spot-instances">Hibernating interrupted Spot Instances</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p> <p>When you stop or hibernate an instance, we shut it down. You can restart your instance at any time. Before stopping or hibernating an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM, but hibernating an instance does preserve data stored in RAM. If an instance cannot hibernate successfully, a normal shutdown occurs.</p> <p>Stopping and hibernating an instance is different to rebooting or terminating it. For example, when you stop or hibernate an instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, the root device and any other devices attached during the instance launch are automatically deleted. For more information about the differences between rebooting, stopping, hibernating, and terminating instances, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html">Instance lifecycle</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p> <p>When you stop an instance, we attempt to shut it down forcibly after a short while. If your instance appears stuck in the stopping state after a period of time, there may be an issue with the underlying host computer. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesStopping.html">Troubleshooting stopping your instance</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p>
* `post_terminate_client_vpn_connections` - Terminates active Client VPN endpoint connections. This action can be used to terminate a specific client connection, or up to five connections established by a specific user.
* `post_terminate_instances` - <p>Shuts down the specified instances. This operation is idempotent; if you terminate an instance more than once, each call succeeds. </p> <p>If you specify multiple instances and the request fails (for example, because of a single incorrect instance ID), none of the instances are terminated.</p> <p>If you terminate multiple instances across multiple Availability Zones, and one or more of the specified instances are enabled for termination protection, the request fails with the following results:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The specified instances that are in the same Availability Zone as the protected instance are not terminated.</p> </li> <li> <p>The specified instances that are in different Availability Zones, where no other specified instances are protected, are successfully terminated.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For example, say you have the following instances:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Instance A: <code>us-east-1a</code>; Not protected</p> </li> <li> <p>Instance B: <code>us-east-1a</code>; Not protected</p> </li> <li> <p>Instance C: <code>us-east-1b</code>; Protected</p> </li> <li> <p>Instance D: <code>us-east-1b</code>; not protected</p> </li> </ul> <p>If you attempt to terminate all of these instances in the same request, the request reports failure with the following results:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Instance A and Instance B are successfully terminated because none of the specified instances in <code>us-east-1a</code> are enabled for termination protection.</p> </li> <li> <p>Instance C and Instance D fail to terminate because at least one of the specified instances in <code>us-east-1b</code> (Instance C) is enabled for termination protection.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Terminated instances remain visible after termination (for approximately one hour).</p> <p>By default, Amazon EC2 deletes all EBS volumes that were attached when the instance launched. Volumes attached after instance launch continue running.</p> <p>You can stop, start, and terminate EBS-backed instances. You can only terminate instance store-backed instances. What happens to an instance differs if you stop it or terminate it. For example, when you stop an instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, any attached EBS volumes with the <code>DeleteOnTermination</code> block device mapping parameter set to <code>true</code> are automatically deleted. For more information about the differences between stopping and terminating instances, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html">Instance lifecycle</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information about troubleshooting, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesShuttingDown.html">Troubleshooting terminating your instance</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p>
* `post_unassign_ipv6_addresses` - Unassigns one or more IPv6 addresses IPv4 Prefix Delegation prefixes from a network interface.
* `post_unassign_private_ip_addresses` - Unassigns one or more secondary private IP addresses, or IPv4 Prefix Delegation prefixes from a network interface.
* `post_unmonitor_instances` - Disables detailed monitoring for a running instance. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-cloudwatch.html">Monitoring your instances and volumes</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.
* `post_update_security_group_rule_descriptions_egress` - [VPC only] Updates the description of an egress (outbound) security group rule. You can replace an existing description, or add a description to a rule that did not have one previously. You can remove a description for a security group rule by omitting the description parameter in the request.
* `post_update_security_group_rule_descriptions_ingress` - Updates the description of an ingress (inbound) security group rule. You can replace an existing description, or add a description to a rule that did not have one previously. You can remove a description for a security group rule by omitting the description parameter in the request.
* `post_withdraw_byoip_cidr` - <p>Stops advertising an address range that is provisioned as an address pool.</p> <p>You can perform this operation at most once every 10 seconds, even if you specify different address ranges each time.</p> <p>It can take a few minutes before traffic to the specified addresses stops routing to Amazon Web Services because of BGP propagation delays.</p>
