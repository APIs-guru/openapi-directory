For more information on user permissions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/opsworks-security-users.html">Managing User Permissions</a>.</p>
* `assign_volume` - <p>Assigns one of the stack's registered Amazon EBS volumes to a specified instance. The volume must first be registered with the stack by calling <a>RegisterVolume</a>.
