### SDK SDK

* `AssignInstance` - <p>Assign a registered instance to a layer.</p> <ul> <li> <p>You can assign registered on-premises instances to any layer type.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can assign registered Amazon EC2 instances only to custom layers.</p> </li> <li> <p>You cannot use this action with instances that were created with AWS OpsWorks Stacks.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Required Permissions</b>: To use this action, an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user must have a Manage permissions level for the stack or an attached policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more information on user permissions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/opsworks-security-users.html">Managing User Permissions</a>.</p>
* `AssignVolume` - <p>Assigns one of the stack's registered Amazon EBS volumes to a specified instance. The volume must first be registered with the stack by calling <a>RegisterVolume</a>. After you register the volume, you must call <a>UpdateVolume</a> to specify a mount point before calling <code>AssignVolume</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/resources.html">Resource Management</a>.</p> <p> <b>Required Permissions</b>: To use this action, an IAM user must have a Manage permissions level for the stack, or an attached policy that explicitly grants permissions.

You should instead use the AWS CLI <code>register</code> command, which performs the entire registration operation. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/registered-instances-register.html"> Registering an Instance with an AWS OpsWorks Stacks Stack</a>.</p> </note> <p>Registered instances have the same requirements as instances that are created by using the <a>CreateInstance</a> API. For example, registered instances must be running a supported Linux-based operating system, and they must have a supported instance type. For more information about requirements for instances that you want to register, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/registered-instances-register-registering-preparer.html"> Preparing the Instance</a>.</p> <p> <b>Required Permissions</b>: To use this action, an IAM user must have a Manage permissions level for the stack or an attached policy that explicitly grants permissions.

Load-based auto scaling operates only on the instances from that set, so you must ensure that you have created enough instances to handle the maximum anticipated load.</p> </note> <p> <b>Required Permissions</b>: To use this action, an IAM user must have a Manage permissions level for the stack, or an attached policy that explicitly grants permissions.
