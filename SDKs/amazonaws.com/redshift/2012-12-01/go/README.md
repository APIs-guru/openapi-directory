## SDK Available Operations

### SDK SDK

* `GetAcceptReservedNodeExchange` - Exchanges a DC1 Reserved Node for a DC2 Reserved Node with no changes to the configuration (term, payment type, or number of nodes) and no additional costs. 
* `GetAddPartner` - Adds a partner integration to a cluster. This operation authorizes a partner to push status updates for the specified database. To complete the integration, you also set up the integration on the partner website.
* `GetAssociateDataShareConsumer` - From a datashare consumer account, associates a datashare with the account (AssociateEntireAccount) or the specified namespace (ConsumerArn). If you make this association, the consumer can consume the datashare.
* `GetAuthorizeClusterSecurityGroupIngress` - <p>Adds an inbound (ingress) rule to an Amazon Redshift security group. Depending on whether the application accessing your cluster is running on the Internet or an Amazon EC2 instance, you can authorize inbound access to either a Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)/Internet Protocol (IP) range or to an Amazon EC2 security group. You can add as many as 20 ingress rules to an Amazon Redshift security group.</p> <p>If you authorize access to an Amazon EC2 security group, specify <i>EC2SecurityGroupName</i> and <i>EC2SecurityGroupOwnerId</i>. The Amazon EC2 security group and Amazon Redshift cluster must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region. </p> <p>If you authorize access to a CIDR/IP address range, specify <i>CIDRIP</i>. For an overview of CIDR blocks, see the Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing">Classless Inter-Domain Routing</a>. </p> <p>You must also associate the security group with a cluster so that clients running on these IP addresses or the EC2 instance are authorized to connect to the cluster. For information about managing security groups, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-security-groups.html">Working with Security Groups</a> in the <i>Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetAuthorizeDataShare` - From a data producer account, authorizes the sharing of a datashare with one or more consumer accounts. To authorize a datashare for a data consumer, the producer account must have the correct access privileges.
* `GetAuthorizeEndpointAccess` - Grants access to a cluster.
* `GetAuthorizeSnapshotAccess` - <p>Authorizes the specified Amazon Web Services account to restore the specified snapshot.</p> <p> For more information about working with snapshots, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-snapshots.html">Amazon Redshift Snapshots</a> in the <i>Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetBatchModifyClusterSnapshots` - Modifies the settings for a set of cluster snapshots.
* `GetCancelResize` - Cancels a resize operation for a cluster.
* `GetCopyClusterSnapshot` - <p>Copies the specified automated cluster snapshot to a new manual cluster snapshot. The source must be an automated snapshot and it must be in the available state.</p> <p>When you delete a cluster, Amazon Redshift deletes any automated snapshots of the cluster. Also, when the retention period of the snapshot expires, Amazon Redshift automatically deletes it. If you want to keep an automated snapshot for a longer period, you can make a manual copy of the snapshot. Manual snapshots are retained until you delete them.</p> <p> For more information about working with snapshots, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-snapshots.html">Amazon Redshift Snapshots</a> in the <i>Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetCreateAuthenticationProfile` - Creates an authentication profile with the specified parameters.
* `GetCreateEndpointAccess` - Creates a Redshift-managed VPC endpoint.
* `GetDeauthorizeDataShare` - From the producer account, removes authorization from the specified datashare. 
* `GetDeleteAuthenticationProfile` - Deletes an authentication profile.
* `GetDeleteCluster` - <p>Deletes a previously provisioned cluster without its final snapshot being created. A successful response from the web service indicates that the request was received correctly. Use <a>DescribeClusters</a> to monitor the status of the deletion. The delete operation cannot be canceled or reverted once submitted. For more information about managing clusters, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html">Amazon Redshift Clusters</a> in the <i>Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide</i>.</p> <p>If you want to shut down the cluster and retain it for future use, set <i>SkipFinalClusterSnapshot</i> to <code>false</code> and specify a name for <i>FinalClusterSnapshotIdentifier</i>. You can later restore this snapshot to resume using the cluster. If a final cluster snapshot is requested, the status of the cluster will be "final-snapshot" while the snapshot is being taken, then it's "deleting" once Amazon Redshift begins deleting the cluster. </p> <p> For more information about managing clusters, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html">Amazon Redshift Clusters</a> in the <i>Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide</i>.</p>

* `GetRestoreFromClusterSnapshot` - <p>Creates a new cluster from a snapshot. By default, Amazon Redshift creates the resulting cluster with the same configuration as the original cluster from which the snapshot was created, except that the new cluster is created with the default cluster security and parameter groups. After Amazon Redshift creates the cluster, you can use the <a>ModifyCluster</a> API to associate a different security group and different parameter group with the restored cluster. If you are using a DS node type, you can also choose to change to another DS node type of the same size during restore.</p> <p>If you restore a cluster into a VPC, you must provide a cluster subnet group where you want the cluster restored.</p> <p> For more information about working with snapshots, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-snapshots.html">Amazon Redshift Snapshots</a> in the <i>Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetRestoreTableFromClusterSnapshot` - <p>Creates a new table from a table in an Amazon Redshift cluster snapshot. You must create the new table within the Amazon Redshift cluster that the snapshot was taken from.</p> <p>You cannot use <code>RestoreTableFromClusterSnapshot</code> to restore a table with the same name as an existing table in an Amazon Redshift cluster. That is, you cannot overwrite an existing table in a cluster with a restored table. If you want to replace your original table with a new, restored table, then rename or drop your original table before you call <code>RestoreTableFromClusterSnapshot</code>. When you have renamed your original table, then you can pass the original name of the table as the <code>NewTableName</code> parameter value in the call to <code>RestoreTableFromClusterSnapshot</code>. This way, you can replace the original table with the table created from the snapshot.</p>
* `GetResumeCluster` - Resumes a paused cluster.
* `GetRevokeClusterSecurityGroupIngress` - Revokes an ingress rule in an Amazon Redshift security group for a previously authorized IP range or Amazon EC2 security group. To add an ingress rule, see <a>AuthorizeClusterSecurityGroupIngress</a>. For information about managing security groups, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-security-groups.html">Amazon Redshift Cluster Security Groups</a> in the <i>Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide</i>.

* `PostCreateEndpointAccess` - Creates a Redshift-managed VPC endpoint.
* `PostCreateEventSubscription` - <p>Creates an Amazon Redshift event notification subscription. This action requires an ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of an Amazon SNS topic created by either the Amazon Redshift console, the Amazon SNS console, or the Amazon SNS API. To obtain an ARN with Amazon SNS, you must create a topic in Amazon SNS and subscribe to the topic. The ARN is displayed in the SNS console.</p> <p>You can specify the source type, and lists of Amazon Redshift source IDs, event categories, and event severities. Notifications will be sent for all events you want that match those criteria. For example, you can specify source type = cluster, source ID = my-cluster-1 and mycluster2, event categories = Availability, Backup, and severity = ERROR. The subscription will only send notifications for those ERROR events in the Availability and Backup categories for the specified clusters.</p> <p>If you specify both the source type and source IDs, such as source type = cluster and source identifier = my-cluster-1, notifications will be sent for all the cluster events for my-cluster-1. If you specify a source type but do not specify a source identifier, you will receive notice of the events for the objects of that type in your Amazon Web Services account. If you do not specify either the SourceType nor the SourceIdentifier, you will be notified of events generated from all Amazon Redshift sources belonging to your Amazon Web Services account.

For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/generating-user-credentials.html">Using IAM Authentication to Generate Database User Credentials</a> in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.</p> <p>The Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role that runs GetClusterCredentials must have an IAM policy attached that allows access to all necessary actions and resources. For more information about permissions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/redshift-iam-access-control-identity-based.html#redshift-policy-resources.getclustercredentials-resources">Resource Policies for GetClusterCredentials</a> in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.</p> <p>If the <code>DbGroups</code> parameter is specified, the IAM policy must allow the <code>redshift:JoinGroup</code> action with access to the listed <code>dbgroups</code>. </p> <p>In addition, if the <code>AutoCreate</code> parameter is set to <code>True</code>, then the policy must include the <code>redshift:CreateClusterUser</code> privilege.</p> <p>If the <code>DbName</code> parameter is specified, the IAM policy must allow access to the resource <code>dbname</code> for the specified database name. </p>
* `PostGetReservedNodeExchangeOfferings` - Returns an array of DC2 ReservedNodeOfferings that matches the payment type, term, and usage price of the given DC1 reserved node.
* `PostModifyAquaConfiguration` - Modifies whether a cluster can use AQUA (Advanced Query Accelerator). 
* `PostModifyAuthenticationProfile` - Modifies an authentication profile.
* `PostModifyCluster` - <p>Modifies the settings for a cluster.</p> <p>You can also change node type and the number of nodes to scale up or down the cluster. When resizing a cluster, you must specify both the number of nodes and the node type even if one of the parameters does not change.</p> <p>You can add another security or parameter group, or change the admin user password. Resetting a cluster password or modifying the security groups associated with a cluster do not need a reboot. However, modifying a parameter group requires a reboot for parameters to take effect. For more information about managing clusters, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html">Amazon Redshift Clusters</a> in the <i>Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostModifyClusterDbRevision` - Modifies the database revision of a cluster. The database revision is a unique revision of the database running in a cluster.

* `PostModifyClusterMaintenance` - Modifies the maintenance settings of a cluster.
* `PostModifyClusterParameterGroup` - <p>Modifies the parameters of a parameter group. For the parameters parameter, it can't contain ASCII characters.</p> <p> For more information about parameters and parameter groups, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-parameter-groups.html">Amazon Redshift Parameter Groups</a> in the <i>Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostModifyClusterSnapshot` - <p>Modifies the settings for a snapshot.</p> <p>This exanmple modifies the manual retention period setting for a cluster snapshot.</p>
* `PostModifyClusterSnapshotSchedule` - Modifies a snapshot schedule for a cluster.
* `PostModifyClusterSubnetGroup` - Modifies a cluster subnet group to include the specified list of VPC subnets. The operation replaces the existing list of subnets with the new list of subnets.
* `PostModifyEndpointAccess` - Modifies a Redshift-managed VPC endpoint.
* `PostModifyEventSubscription` - Modifies an existing Amazon Redshift event notification subscription.
* `PostModifyScheduledAction` - Modifies a scheduled action. 
* `PostModifySnapshotCopyRetentionPeriod` - Modifies the number of days to retain snapshots in the destination Amazon Web Services Region after they are copied from the source Amazon Web Services Region. By default, this operation only changes the retention period of copied automated snapshots. The retention periods for both new and existing copied automated snapshots are updated with the new retention period. You can set the manual option to change only the retention periods of copied manual snapshots. If you set this option, only newly copied manual snapshots have the new retention period. 
* `PostModifySnapshotSchedule` - Modifies a snapshot schedule. Any schedule associated with a cluster is modified asynchronously.
* `PostModifyUsageLimit` - Modifies a usage limit in a cluster. You can't modify the feature type or period of a usage limit.
* `PostPauseCluster` - Pauses a cluster.
* `PostPurchaseReservedNodeOffering` - <p>Allows you to purchase reserved nodes. Amazon Redshift offers a predefined set of reserved node offerings. You can purchase one or more of the offerings. You can call the <a>DescribeReservedNodeOfferings</a> API to obtain the available reserved node offerings. You can call this API by providing a specific reserved node offering and the number of nodes you want to reserve. </p> <p> For more information about reserved node offerings, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/purchase-reserved-node-instance.html">Purchasing Reserved Nodes</a> in the <i>Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostRebootCluster` - Reboots a cluster. This action is taken as soon as possible. It results in a momentary outage to the cluster, during which the cluster status is set to <code>rebooting</code>. A cluster event is created when the reboot is completed. Any pending cluster modifications (see <a>ModifyCluster</a>) are applied at this reboot. For more information about managing clusters, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html">Amazon Redshift Clusters</a> in the <i>Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide</i>. 
* `PostRejectDataShare` - From the consumer account, rejects the specified datashare.
* `PostResetClusterParameterGroup` - Sets one or more parameters of the specified parameter group to their default values and sets the source values of the parameters to "engine-default". To reset the entire parameter group specify the <i>ResetAllParameters</i> parameter. For parameter changes to take effect you must reboot any associated clusters. 
* `PostResizeCluster` - <p>Changes the size of the cluster. You can change the cluster's type, or change the number or type of nodes. The default behavior is to use the elastic resize method. With an elastic resize, your cluster is available for read and write operations more quickly than with the classic resize method. </p> <p>Elastic resize operations have the following restrictions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You can only resize clusters of the following types:</p> <ul> <li> <p>dc1.large (if your cluster is in a VPC)</p> </li> <li> <p>dc1.8xlarge (if your cluster is in a VPC)</p> </li> <li> <p>dc2.large</p> </li> <li> <p>dc2.8xlarge</p> </li> <li> <p>ds2.xlarge</p> </li> <li> <p>ds2.8xlarge</p> </li> <li> <p>ra3.xlplus</p> </li> <li> <p>ra3.4xlarge</p> </li> <li> <p>ra3.16xlarge</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The type of nodes that you add must match the node type for the cluster.</p> </li> </ul>
* `PostRestoreFromClusterSnapshot` - <p>Creates a new cluster from a snapshot. By default, Amazon Redshift creates the resulting cluster with the same configuration as the original cluster from which the snapshot was created, except that the new cluster is created with the default cluster security and parameter groups. After Amazon Redshift creates the cluster, you can use the <a>ModifyCluster</a> API to associate a different security group and different parameter group with the restored cluster. If you are using a DS node type, you can also choose to change to another DS node type of the same size during restore.</p> <p>If you restore a cluster into a VPC, you must provide a cluster subnet group where you want the cluster restored.</p> <p> For more information about working with snapshots, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-snapshots.html">Amazon Redshift Snapshots</a> in the <i>Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostRestoreTableFromClusterSnapshot` - <p>Creates a new table from a table in an Amazon Redshift cluster snapshot. You must create the new table within the Amazon Redshift cluster that the snapshot was taken from.</p> <p>You cannot use <code>RestoreTableFromClusterSnapshot</code> to restore a table with the same name as an existing table in an Amazon Redshift cluster. That is, you cannot overwrite an existing table in a cluster with a restored table. If you want to replace your original table with a new, restored table, then rename or drop your original table before you call <code>RestoreTableFromClusterSnapshot</code>. When you have renamed your original table, then you can pass the original name of the table as the <code>NewTableName</code> parameter value in the call to <code>RestoreTableFromClusterSnapshot</code>. This way, you can replace the original table with the table created from the snapshot.</p>
* `PostResumeCluster` - Resumes a paused cluster.
* `PostRevokeClusterSecurityGroupIngress` - Revokes an ingress rule in an Amazon Redshift security group for a previously authorized IP range or Amazon EC2 security group. To add an ingress rule, see <a>AuthorizeClusterSecurityGroupIngress</a>. For information about managing security groups, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-security-groups.html">Amazon Redshift Cluster Security Groups</a> in the <i>Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide</i>. 
* `PostRevokeEndpointAccess` - Revokes access to a cluster.
* `PostRevokeSnapshotAccess` - <p>Removes the ability of the specified Amazon Web Services account to restore the specified snapshot. If the account is currently restoring the snapshot, the restore will run to completion.</p> <p> For more information about working with snapshots, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-snapshots.html">Amazon Redshift Snapshots</a> in the <i>Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide</i>.</p>
