### SDK SDK

* `getAttachInstances` - <p>Attaches one or more EC2 instances to the specified Auto Scaling group.</p> <p>When you attach instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling increases the desired capacity of the group by the number of instances being attached. If the number of instances being attached plus the desired capacity of the group exceeds the maximum size of the group, the operation fails.</p> <p>If there is a Classic Load Balancer attached to your Auto Scaling group, the instances are also registered with the load balancer. If there are target groups attached to your Auto Scaling group, the instances are also registered with the target groups.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/attach-instance-asg.html">Attach EC2 instances to your Auto Scaling group</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide</i>.</p>
* `getAttachLoadBalancerTargetGroups` - <p>Attaches one or more target groups to the specified Auto Scaling group.</p> <p>This operation is used with the following load balancer types: </p> <ul> <li> <p> Application Load Balancer - Operates at the application layer (layer 7) and supports HTTP and HTTPS. </p> </li> <li> <p> Network Load Balancer - Operates at the transport layer (layer 4) and supports TCP, TLS, and UDP. </p> </li> <li> <p> Gateway Load Balancer - Operates at the network layer (layer 3).</p> </li> </ul> <p>To describe the target groups for an Auto Scaling group, call the <a>DescribeLoadBalancerTargetGroups</a> API. To detach the target group from the Auto Scaling group, call the <a>DetachLoadBalancerTargetGroups</a> API.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/autoscaling-load-balancer.html">Elastic Load Balancing and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide</i>. </p>
* `getAttachLoadBalancers` - <note> <p>To attach an Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, or Gateway Load Balancer, use the <a>AttachLoadBalancerTargetGroups</a> API operation instead.</p> </note> <p>Attaches one or more Classic Load Balancers to the specified Auto Scaling group. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling registers the running instances with these Classic Load Balancers.</p> <p>To describe the load balancers for an Auto Scaling group, call the <a>DescribeLoadBalancers</a> API. To detach the load balancer from the Auto Scaling group, call the <a>DetachLoadBalancers</a> API.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/autoscaling-load-balancer.html">Elastic Load Balancing and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide</i>. </p>
* `getBatchDeleteScheduledAction` - Deletes one or more scheduled actions for the specified Auto Scaling group.
* `getCancelInstanceRefresh` - <p>Cancels an instance refresh operation in progress. Cancellation does not roll back any replacements that have already been completed, but it prevents new replacements from being started. </p> <p>This operation is part of the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-refresh.html">instance refresh feature</a> in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, which helps you update instances in your Auto Scaling group after you make configuration changes.</p>
* `getCompleteLifecycleAction` - <p>Completes the lifecycle action for the specified token or instance with the specified result.</p> <p>This step is a part of the procedure for adding a lifecycle hook to an Auto Scaling group:</p> <ol> <li> <p>(Optional) Create a Lambda function and a rule that allows CloudWatch Events to invoke your Lambda function when Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches or terminates instances.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) Create a notification target and an IAM role. The target can be either an Amazon SQS queue or an Amazon SNS topic. The role allows Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to publish lifecycle notifications to the target.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create the lifecycle hook. Specify whether the hook is used when the instances launch or terminate.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you need more time, record the lifecycle action heartbeat to keep the instance in a pending state.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>If you finish before the timeout period ends, complete the lifecycle action.</b> </p> </li> </ol> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html">Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide</i>.</p>
* `getDeleteAutoScalingGroup` - <p>Deletes the specified Auto Scaling group.</p> <p>If the group has instances or scaling activities in progress, you must specify the option to force the deletion in order for it to succeed.</p> <p>If the group has policies, deleting the group deletes the policies, the underlying alarm actions, and any alarm that no longer has an associated action.</p> <p>To remove instances from the Auto Scaling group before deleting it, call the <a>DetachInstances</a> API with the list of instances and the option to decrement the desired capacity. This ensures that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling does not launch replacement instances.</p> <p>To terminate all instances before deleting the Auto Scaling group, call the <a>UpdateAutoScalingGroup</a> API and set the minimum size and desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group to zero.</p>
* `getDeleteLaunchConfiguration` - <p>Deletes the specified launch configuration.</p> <p>The launch configuration must not be attached to an Auto Scaling group. When this call completes, the launch configuration is no longer available for use.</p>

* `getDescribeLifecycleHooks` - Gets information about the lifecycle hooks for the specified Auto Scaling group.
* `getDescribeLoadBalancerTargetGroups` - <p>Gets information about the load balancer target groups for the specified Auto Scaling group.</p> <p>To determine the availability of registered instances, use the <code>State</code> element in the response. When you attach a target group to an Auto Scaling group, the initial <code>State</code> value is <code>Adding</code>. The state transitions to <code>Added</code> after all Auto Scaling instances are registered with the target group. If Elastic Load Balancing health checks are enabled for the Auto Scaling group, the state transitions to <code>InService</code> after at least one Auto Scaling instance passes the health check. When the target group is in the <code>InService</code> state, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can terminate and replace any instances that are reported as unhealthy. If no registered instances pass the health checks, the target group doesn't enter the <code>InService</code> state. </p> <p>Target groups also have an <code>InService</code> state if you attach them in the <a>CreateAutoScalingGroup</a> API call. If your target group state is <code>InService</code>, but it is not working properly, check the scaling activities by calling <a>DescribeScalingActivities</a> and take any corrective actions necessary.</p> <p>For help with failed health checks, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ts-as-healthchecks.html">Troubleshooting Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling: Health checks</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide</i>.

* `getGetPredictiveScalingForecast` - <p>Retrieves the forecast data for a predictive scaling policy.</p> <p>Load forecasts are predictions of the hourly load values using historical load data from CloudWatch and an analysis of historical trends. Capacity forecasts are represented as predicted values for the minimum capacity that is needed on an hourly basis, based on the hourly load forecast.</p> <p>A minimum of 24 hours of data is required to create the initial forecasts. However, having a full 14 days of historical data results in more accurate forecasts.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-predictive-scaling.html">Predictive scaling for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide</i>.</p>
* `getPutLifecycleHook` - <p>Creates or updates a lifecycle hook for the specified Auto Scaling group.</p> <p>A lifecycle hook tells Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to perform an action on an instance when the instance launches (before it is put into service) or as the instance terminates (before it is fully terminated).</p> <p>This step is a part of the procedure for adding a lifecycle hook to an Auto Scaling group:</p> <ol> <li> <p>(Optional) Create a Lambda function and a rule that allows CloudWatch Events to invoke your Lambda function when Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches or terminates instances.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) Create a notification target and an IAM role. The target can be either an Amazon SQS queue or an Amazon SNS topic. The role allows Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to publish lifecycle notifications to the target.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Create the lifecycle hook. Specify whether the hook is used when the instances launch or terminate.</b> </p> </li> <li> <p>If you need more time, record the lifecycle action heartbeat to keep the instance in a pending state using the <a>RecordLifecycleActionHeartbeat</a> API call.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you finish before the timeout period ends, complete the lifecycle action using the <a>CompleteLifecycleAction</a> API call.</p> </li> </ol> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html">Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide</i>.</p> <p>If you exceed your maximum limit of lifecycle hooks, which by default is 50 per Auto Scaling group, the call fails.</p> <p>You can view the lifecycle hooks for an Auto Scaling group using the <a>DescribeLifecycleHooks</a> API call. If you are no longer using a lifecycle hook, you can delete it by calling the <a>DeleteLifecycleHook</a> API.</p>
* `getPutNotificationConfiguration` - <p>Configures an Auto Scaling group to send notifications when specified events take place. Subscribers to the specified topic can have messages delivered to an endpoint such as a web server or an email address.</p> <p>This configuration overwrites any existing configuration.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ASGettingNotifications.html">Getting Amazon SNS notifications when your Auto Scaling group scales</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide</i>.</p> <p>If you exceed your maximum limit of SNS topics, which is 10 per Auto Scaling group, the call fails.</p>
* `getPutScheduledUpdateGroupAction` - <p>Creates or updates a scheduled scaling action for an Auto Scaling group.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/schedule_time.html">Scheduled scaling</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can view the scheduled actions for an Auto Scaling group using the <a>DescribeScheduledActions</a> API call. If you are no longer using a scheduled action, you can delete it by calling the <a>DeleteScheduledAction</a> API.</p>
* `getPutWarmPool` - <p>Creates or updates a warm pool for the specified Auto Scaling group. A warm pool is a pool of pre-initialized EC2 instances that sits alongside the Auto Scaling group. Whenever your application needs to scale out, the Auto Scaling group can draw on the warm pool to meet its new desired capacity. For more information and example configurations, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-warm-pools.html">Warm pools for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide</i>.</p> <p>This operation must be called from the Region in which the Auto Scaling group was created. This operation cannot be called on an Auto Scaling group that has a mixed instances policy or a launch template or launch configuration that requests Spot Instances.</p> <p>You can view the instances in the warm pool using the <a>DescribeWarmPool</a> API call. If you are no longer using a warm pool, you can delete it by calling the <a>DeleteWarmPool</a> API.</p>
* `getRecordLifecycleActionHeartbeat` - <p>Records a heartbeat for the lifecycle action associated with the specified token or instance. This extends the timeout by the length of time defined using the <a>PutLifecycleHook</a> API call.</p> <p>This step is a part of the procedure for adding a lifecycle hook to an Auto Scaling group:</p> <ol> <li> <p>(Optional) Create a Lambda function and a rule that allows CloudWatch Events to invoke your Lambda function when Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches or terminates instances.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) Create a notification target and an IAM role. The target can be either an Amazon SQS queue or an Amazon SNS topic. The role allows Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to publish lifecycle notifications to the target.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create the lifecycle hook. Specify whether the hook is used when the instances launch or terminate.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>If you need more time, record the lifecycle action heartbeat to keep the instance in a pending state.</b> </p> </li> <li> <p>If you finish before the timeout period ends, complete the lifecycle action.</p> </li> </ol> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html">Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide</i>.</p>

* `getSetInstanceProtection` - <p>Updates the instance protection settings of the specified instances. This operation cannot be called on instances in a warm pool.</p> <p>For more information about preventing instances that are part of an Auto Scaling group from terminating on scale in, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-instance-termination.html#instance-protection">Instance scale-in protection</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide</i>.</p> <p>If you exceed your maximum limit of instance IDs, which is 50 per Auto Scaling group, the call fails.</p>
* `getSuspendProcesses` - <p>Suspends the specified auto scaling processes, or all processes, for the specified Auto Scaling group.</p> <p>If you suspend either the <code>Launch</code> or <code>Terminate</code> process types, it can prevent other process types from functioning properly. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-suspend-resume-processes.html">Suspending and resuming scaling processes</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide</i>.</p> <p>To resume processes that have been suspended, call the <a>ResumeProcesses</a> API.</p>
* `getTerminateInstanceInAutoScalingGroup` - <p>Terminates the specified instance and optionally adjusts the desired group size. This operation cannot be called on instances in a warm pool.</p> <p>This call simply makes a termination request. The instance is not terminated immediately. When an instance is terminated, the instance status changes to <code>terminated</code>. You can't connect to or start an instance after you've terminated it.</p> <p>If you do not specify the option to decrement the desired capacity, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches instances to replace the ones that are terminated. </p> <p>By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling balances instances across all Availability Zones. If you decrement the desired capacity, your Auto Scaling group can become unbalanced between Availability Zones. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling tries to rebalance the group, and rebalancing might terminate instances in other zones. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/auto-scaling-benefits.html#AutoScalingBehavior.InstanceUsage">Rebalancing activities</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide</i>.</p>
* `postAttachInstances` - <p>Attaches one or more EC2 instances to the specified Auto Scaling group.</p> <p>When you attach instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling increases the desired capacity of the group by the number of instances being attached. If the number of instances being attached plus the desired capacity of the group exceeds the maximum size of the group, the operation fails.</p> <p>If there is a Classic Load Balancer attached to your Auto Scaling group, the instances are also registered with the load balancer.

This operation cannot be called on instances in a warm pool.</p> <p>For more information about preventing instances that are part of an Auto Scaling group from terminating on scale in, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-instance-termination.html#instance-protection">Instance scale-in protection</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide</i>.</p> <p>If you exceed your maximum limit of instance IDs, which is 50 per Auto Scaling group, the call fails.</p>
* `postStartInstanceRefresh` - <p>Starts a new instance refresh operation. An instance refresh performs a rolling replacement of all or some instances in an Auto Scaling group. Each instance is terminated first and then replaced, which temporarily reduces the capacity available within your Auto Scaling group.</p> <p>This operation is part of the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-refresh.html">instance refresh feature</a> in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, which helps you update instances in your Auto Scaling group. This feature is helpful, for example, when you have a new AMI or a new user data script. You just need to create a new launch template that specifies the new AMI or user data script. Then start an instance refresh to immediately begin the process of updating instances in the group. </p> <p>If the call succeeds, it creates a new instance refresh request with a unique ID that you can use to track its progress. To query its status, call the <a>DescribeInstanceRefreshes</a> API. To describe the instance refreshes that have already run, call the <a>DescribeInstanceRefreshes</a> API. To cancel an instance refresh operation in progress, use the <a>CancelInstanceRefresh</a> API. </p>
* `postSuspendProcesses` - <p>Suspends the specified auto scaling processes, or all processes, for the specified Auto Scaling group.</p> <p>If you suspend either the <code>Launch</code> or <code>Terminate</code> process types, it can prevent other process types from functioning properly. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-suspend-resume-processes.html">Suspending and resuming scaling processes</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide</i>.</p> <p>To resume processes that have been suspended, call the <a>ResumeProcesses</a> API.</p>
* `postTerminateInstanceInAutoScalingGroup` - <p>Terminates the specified instance and optionally adjusts the desired group size. This operation cannot be called on instances in a warm pool.</p> <p>This call simply makes a termination request. The instance is not terminated immediately. When an instance is terminated, the instance status changes to <code>terminated</code>. You can't connect to or start an instance after you've terminated it.</p> <p>If you do not specify the option to decrement the desired capacity, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches instances to replace the ones that are terminated. </p> <p>By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling balances instances across all Availability Zones. If you decrement the desired capacity, your Auto Scaling group can become unbalanced between Availability Zones. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling tries to rebalance the group, and rebalancing might terminate instances in other zones. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/auto-scaling-benefits.html#AutoScalingBehavior.InstanceUsage">Rebalancing activities</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide</i>.</p>
* `postUpdateAutoScalingGroup` - <p> <b>We strongly recommend that all Auto Scaling groups use launch templates to ensure full functionality for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and Amazon EC2.</b> </p> <p>Updates the configuration for the specified Auto Scaling group.</p> <p>To update an Auto Scaling group, specify the name of the group and the parameter that you want to change. Any parameters that you don't specify are not changed by this update request. The new settings take effect on any scaling activities after this call returns. </p> <p>If you associate a new launch configuration or template with an Auto Scaling group, all new instances will get the updated configuration. Existing instances continue to run with the configuration that they were originally launched with. When you update a group to specify a mixed instances policy instead of a launch configuration or template, existing instances may be replaced to match the new purchasing options that you specified in the policy. For example, if the group currently has 100% On-Demand capacity and the policy specifies 50% Spot capacity, this means that half of your instances will be gradually terminated and relaunched as Spot Instances. When replacing instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches new instances before terminating the old ones, so that updating your group does not compromise the performance or availability of your application.</p> <p>Note the following about changing <code>DesiredCapacity</code>, <code>MaxSize</code>, or <code>MinSize</code>:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If a scale-in activity occurs as a result of a new <code>DesiredCapacity</code> value that is lower than the current size of the group, the Auto Scaling group uses its termination policy to determine which instances to terminate.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you specify a new value for <code>MinSize</code> without specifying a value for <code>DesiredCapacity</code>, and the new <code>MinSize</code> is larger than the current size of the group, this sets the group's <code>DesiredCapacity</code> to the new <code>MinSize</code> value.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you specify a new value for <code>MaxSize</code> without specifying a value for <code>DesiredCapacity</code>, and the new <code>MaxSize</code> is smaller than the current size of the group, this sets the group's <code>DesiredCapacity</code> to the new <code>MaxSize</code> value.</p> </li> </ul> <p>To see which parameters have been set, call the <a>DescribeAutoScalingGroups</a> API. To view the scaling policies for an Auto Scaling group, call the <a>DescribePolicies</a> API. If the group has scaling policies, you can update them by calling the <a>PutScalingPolicy</a> API.</p>
