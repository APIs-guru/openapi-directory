// StepAdjustment
/** 
 * <p>Describes information used to create a step adjustment for a step scaling policy.</p> <p>For the following examples, suppose that you have an alarm with a breach threshold of 50:</p> <ul> <li> <p>To trigger the adjustment when the metric is greater than or equal to 50 and less than 60, specify a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of 10.</p> </li> <li> <p>To trigger the adjustment when the metric is greater than 40 and less than or equal to 50, specify a lower bound of -10 and an upper bound of 0.</p> </li> </ul> <p>There are a few rules for the step adjustments for your step policy:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The ranges of your step adjustments can't overlap or have a gap.</p> </li> <li> <p>At most, one step adjustment can have a null lower bound. If one step adjustment has a negative lower bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null lower bound.</p> </li> <li> <p>At most, one step adjustment can have a null upper bound. If one step adjustment has a positive upper bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null upper bound.</p> </li> <li> <p>The upper and lower bound can't be null in the same step adjustment.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scaling-simple-step.html#as-scaling-steps">Step adjustments</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide</i>.</p>
