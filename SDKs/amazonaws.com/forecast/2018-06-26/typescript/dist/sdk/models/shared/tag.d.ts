 * <p>The optional metadata that you apply to a resource to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.</p> <p>The following basic restrictions apply to tags:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.</p> </li> <li> <p>For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.</p> </li> <li> <p>Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.</p> </li> <li> <p>Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.</p> </li> <li> <p>If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tag keys and values are case sensitive.</p> </li> <li> <p>Do not use <code>aws:</code>, <code>AWS:</code>, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has <code>aws</code> as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of <code>aws</code> do not count against your tags per resource limit.</p> </li> </ul>
