## SDK Available Operations

### SDK SDK

* `GetAddClientIDToOpenIDConnectProvider` - <p>Adds a new client ID (also known as audience) to the list of client IDs already registered for the specified IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider resource.</p> <p>This operation is idempotent; it does not fail or return an error if you add an existing client ID to the provider.</p>
* `GetAddRoleToInstanceProfile` - <p>Adds the specified IAM role to the specified instance profile. An instance profile can contain only one role, and this quota cannot be increased. You can remove the existing role and then add a different role to an instance profile. You must then wait for the change to appear across all of Amazon Web Services because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">eventual consistency</a>. To force the change, you must <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DisassociateIamInstanceProfile.html">disassociate the instance profile</a> and then <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_AssociateIamInstanceProfile.html">associate the instance profile</a>, or you can stop your instance and then restart it.</p> <note> <p>The caller of this operation must be granted the <code>PassRole</code> permission on the IAM role by a permissions policy.</p> </note> <p>For more information about roles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithRoles.html">Working with roles</a>. For more information about instance profiles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/AboutInstanceProfiles.html">About instance profiles</a>.</p>
* `GetAddUserToGroup` - Adds the specified user to the specified group.
* `GetAttachGroupPolicy` - <p>Attaches the specified managed policy to the specified IAM group.</p> <p>You use this operation to attach a managed policy to a group. To embed an inline policy in a group, use <a>PutGroupPolicy</a>.</p> <p>As a best practice, you can validate your IAM policies. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_policy-validator.html">Validating IAM policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information about policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed policies and inline policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetAttachRolePolicy` - <p>Attaches the specified managed policy to the specified IAM role. When you attach a managed policy to a role, the managed policy becomes part of the role's permission (access) policy.</p> <note> <p>You cannot use a managed policy as the role's trust policy. The role's trust policy is created at the same time as the role, using <a>CreateRole</a>. You can update a role's trust policy using <a>UpdateAssumeRolePolicy</a>.</p> </note> <p>Use this operation to attach a <i>managed</i> policy to a role. To embed an inline policy in a role, use <a>PutRolePolicy</a>. For more information about policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed policies and inline policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>As a best practice, you can validate your IAM policies. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_policy-validator.html">Validating IAM policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetAttachUserPolicy` - <p>Attaches the specified managed policy to the specified user.</p> <p>You use this operation to attach a <i>managed</i> policy to a user. To embed an inline policy in a user, use <a>PutUserPolicy</a>.</p> <p>As a best practice, you can validate your IAM policies. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_policy-validator.html">Validating IAM policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information about policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed policies and inline policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetChangePassword` - <p>Changes the password of the IAM user who is calling this operation. This operation can be performed using the CLI, the Amazon Web Services API, or the <b>My Security Credentials</b> page in the Management Console. The account root user password is not affected by this operation.</p> <p>Use <a>UpdateLoginProfile</a> to use the CLI, the Amazon Web Services API, or the <b>Users</b> page in the IAM console to change the password for any IAM user. For more information about modifying passwords, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_ManagingLogins.html">Managing passwords</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetCreateAccessKey` - <p> Creates a new Amazon Web Services secret access key and corresponding Amazon Web Services access key ID for the specified user. The default status for new keys is <code>Active</code>.</p> <p>If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID signing the request. This operation works for access keys under the account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage account root user credentials. This is true even if the account has no associated users.</p> <p> For information about quotas on the number of keys you can create, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html">IAM and STS quotas</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <important> <p>To ensure the security of your account, the secret access key is accessible only during key and user creation. You must save the key (for example, in a text file) if you want to be able to access it again. If a secret key is lost, you can delete the access keys for the associated user and then create new keys.</p> </important>
* `GetCreateAccountAlias` - Creates an alias for your account. For information about using an account alias, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/AccountAlias.html">Using an alias for your account ID</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
* `GetCreateGroup` - <p>Creates a new group.</p> <p> For information about the number of groups you can create, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html">IAM and STS quotas</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetCreateLoginProfile` - <p>Creates a password for the specified IAM user. A password allows an IAM user to access Amazon Web Services services through the Management Console.</p> <p>You can use the CLI, the Amazon Web Services API, or the <b>Users</b> page in the IAM console to create a password for any IAM user. Use <a>ChangePassword</a> to update your own existing password in the <b>My Security Credentials</b> page in the Management Console.</p> <p>For more information about managing passwords, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_ManagingLogins.html">Managing passwords</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetCreatePolicyVersion` - <p>Creates a new version of the specified managed policy. To update a managed policy, you create a new policy version. A managed policy can have up to five versions. If the policy has five versions, you must delete an existing version using <a>DeletePolicyVersion</a> before you create a new version.</p> <p>Optionally, you can set the new version as the policy's default version. The default version is the version that is in effect for the IAM users, groups, and roles to which the policy is attached.</p> <p>For more information about managed policy versions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-versions.html">Versioning for managed policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetCreateServiceLinkedRole` - <p>Creates an IAM role that is linked to a specific Amazon Web Services service. The service controls the attached policies and when the role can be deleted. This helps ensure that the service is not broken by an unexpectedly changed or deleted role, which could put your Amazon Web Services resources into an unknown state. Allowing the service to control the role helps improve service stability and proper cleanup when a service and its role are no longer needed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html">Using service-linked roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p>To attach a policy to this service-linked role, you must make the request using the Amazon Web Services service that depends on this role.</p>
* `GetCreateServiceSpecificCredential` - <p>Generates a set of credentials consisting of a user name and password that can be used to access the service specified in the request. These credentials are generated by IAM, and can be used only for the specified service. </p> <p>You can have a maximum of two sets of service-specific credentials for each supported service per user.</p> <p>You can create service-specific credentials for CodeCommit and Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra).</p> <p>You can reset the password to a new service-generated value by calling <a>ResetServiceSpecificCredential</a>.</p> <p>For more information about service-specific credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_ssh-keys.html">Using IAM with CodeCommit: Git credentials, SSH keys, and Amazon Web Services access keys</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetDeactivateMfaDevice` - <p>Deactivates the specified MFA device and removes it from association with the user name for which it was originally enabled.</p> <p>For more information about creating and working with virtual MFA devices, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_VirtualMFA.html">Enabling a virtual multi-factor authentication (MFA) device</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetDeleteAccessKey` - <p>Deletes the access key pair associated with the specified IAM user.</p> <p>If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID signing the request. This operation works for access keys under the account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage account root user credentials even if the account has no associated users.</p>
* `GetDeleteAccountAlias` -  Deletes the specified account alias. For information about using an Amazon Web Services account alias, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/AccountAlias.html">Using an alias for your account ID</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
* `GetDeleteAccountPasswordPolicy` - Deletes the password policy for the account. There are no parameters.
* `GetDeleteGroup` - Deletes the specified IAM group. The group must not contain any users or have any attached policies.
* `GetDeleteGroupPolicy` - <p>Deletes the specified inline policy that is embedded in the specified IAM group.</p> <p>A group can also have managed policies attached to it. To detach a managed policy from a group, use <a>DetachGroupPolicy</a>. For more information about policies, refer to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed policies and inline policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetDeleteInstanceProfile` - <p>Deletes the specified instance profile. The instance profile must not have an associated role.</p> <important> <p>Make sure that you do not have any Amazon EC2 instances running with the instance profile you are about to delete. Deleting a role or instance profile that is associated with a running instance will break any applications running on the instance.</p> </important> <p>For more information about instance profiles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/AboutInstanceProfiles.html">About instance profiles</a>.</p>
* `GetDeleteLoginProfile` - <p>Deletes the password for the specified IAM user, which terminates the user's ability to access Amazon Web Services services through the Management Console.</p> <p>You can use the CLI, the Amazon Web Services API, or the <b>Users</b> page in the IAM console to delete a password for any IAM user. You can use <a>ChangePassword</a> to update, but not delete, your own password in the <b>My Security Credentials</b> page in the Management Console.</p> <important> <p> Deleting a user's password does not prevent a user from accessing Amazon Web Services through the command line interface or the API. To prevent all user access, you must also either make any access keys inactive or delete them. For more information about making keys inactive or deleting them, see <a>UpdateAccessKey</a> and <a>DeleteAccessKey</a>. </p> </important>
* `GetDeleteOpenIDConnectProvider` - <p>Deletes an OpenID Connect identity provider (IdP) resource object in IAM.</p> <p>Deleting an IAM OIDC provider resource does not update any roles that reference the provider as a principal in their trust policies. Any attempt to assume a role that references a deleted provider fails.</p> <p>This operation is idempotent; it does not fail or return an error if you call the operation for a provider that does not exist.</p>
* `GetDeletePolicy` - <p>Deletes the specified managed policy.</p> <p>Before you can delete a managed policy, you must first detach the policy from all users, groups, and roles that it is attached to. In addition, you must delete all the policy's versions. The following steps describe the process for deleting a managed policy:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Detach the policy from all users, groups, and roles that the policy is attached to, using <a>DetachUserPolicy</a>, <a>DetachGroupPolicy</a>, or <a>DetachRolePolicy</a>. To list all the users, groups, and roles that a policy is attached to, use <a>ListEntitiesForPolicy</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Delete all versions of the policy using <a>DeletePolicyVersion</a>. To list the policy's versions, use <a>ListPolicyVersions</a>. You cannot use <a>DeletePolicyVersion</a> to delete the version that is marked as the default version. You delete the policy's default version in the next step of the process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Delete the policy (this automatically deletes the policy's default version) using this operation.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For information about managed policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed policies and inline policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetDeletePolicyVersion` - <p>Deletes the specified version from the specified managed policy.</p> <p>You cannot delete the default version from a policy using this operation. To delete the default version from a policy, use <a>DeletePolicy</a>. To find out which version of a policy is marked as the default version, use <a>ListPolicyVersions</a>.</p> <p>For information about versions for managed policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-versions.html">Versioning for managed policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetDeleteRole` - <p>Deletes the specified role. The role must not have any policies attached. For more information about roles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithRoles.html">Working with roles</a>.</p> <important> <p>Make sure that you do not have any Amazon EC2 instances running with the role you are about to delete. Deleting a role or instance profile that is associated with a running instance will break any applications running on the instance.</p> </important>
* `GetDeleteRolePermissionsBoundary` - <p>Deletes the permissions boundary for the specified IAM role. </p> <important> <p>Deleting the permissions boundary for a role might increase its permissions. For example, it might allow anyone who assumes the role to perform all the actions granted in its permissions policies. </p> </important>
* `GetDeleteRolePolicy` - <p>Deletes the specified inline policy that is embedded in the specified IAM role.</p> <p>A role can also have managed policies attached to it. To detach a managed policy from a role, use <a>DetachRolePolicy</a>. For more information about policies, refer to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed policies and inline policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetDeleteSamlProvider` - <p>Deletes a SAML provider resource in IAM.</p> <p>Deleting the provider resource from IAM does not update any roles that reference the SAML provider resource's ARN as a principal in their trust policies. Any attempt to assume a role that references a non-existent provider resource ARN fails.</p> <note> <p> This operation requires <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4</a>.</p> </note>
* `GetDeleteSSHPublicKey` - <p>Deletes the specified SSH public key.</p> <p>The SSH public key deleted by this operation is used only for authenticating the associated IAM user to an CodeCommit repository. For more information about using SSH keys to authenticate to an CodeCommit repository, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-credentials-ssh.html">Set up CodeCommit for SSH connections</a> in the <i>CodeCommit User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetDeleteServerCertificate` - <p>Deletes the specified server certificate.</p> <p>For more information about working with server certificates, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html">Working with server certificates</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. This topic also includes a list of Amazon Web Services services that can use the server certificates that you manage with IAM.</p> <important> <p> If you are using a server certificate with Elastic Load Balancing, deleting the certificate could have implications for your application. If Elastic Load Balancing doesn't detect the deletion of bound certificates, it may continue to use the certificates. This could cause Elastic Load Balancing to stop accepting traffic. We recommend that you remove the reference to the certificate from Elastic Load Balancing before using this command to delete the certificate. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteLoadBalancerListeners.html">DeleteLoadBalancerListeners</a> in the <i>Elastic Load Balancing API Reference</i>.</p> </important>
* `GetDeleteServiceLinkedRole` - <p>Submits a service-linked role deletion request and returns a <code>DeletionTaskId</code>, which you can use to check the status of the deletion. Before you call this operation, confirm that the role has no active sessions and that any resources used by the role in the linked service are deleted. If you call this operation more than once for the same service-linked role and an earlier deletion task is not complete, then the <code>DeletionTaskId</code> of the earlier request is returned.</p> <p>If you submit a deletion request for a service-linked role whose linked service is still accessing a resource, then the deletion task fails. If it fails, the <a>GetServiceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus</a> operation returns the reason for the failure, usually including the resources that must be deleted. To delete the service-linked role, you must first remove those resources from the linked service and then submit the deletion request again. Resources are specific to the service that is linked to the role. For more information about removing resources from a service, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services documentation</a> for your service.</p> <p>For more information about service-linked roles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role">Roles terms and concepts: Amazon Web Services service-linked role</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetDeleteServiceSpecificCredential` - Deletes the specified service-specific credential.
* `GetDeleteSigningCertificate` - <p>Deletes a signing certificate associated with the specified IAM user.</p> <p>If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID signing the request. This operation works for access keys under the account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage account root user credentials even if the account has no associated IAM users.</p>
* `GetDeleteUser` - <p>Deletes the specified IAM user. Unlike the Management Console, when you delete a user programmatically, you must delete the items attached to the user manually, or the deletion fails. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_manage.html#id_users_deleting_cli">Deleting an IAM user</a>. Before attempting to delete a user, remove the following items:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Password (<a>DeleteLoginProfile</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>Access keys (<a>DeleteAccessKey</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>Signing certificate (<a>DeleteSigningCertificate</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>SSH public key (<a>DeleteSSHPublicKey</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>Git credentials (<a>DeleteServiceSpecificCredential</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) device (<a>DeactivateMFADevice</a>, <a>DeleteVirtualMFADevice</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>Inline policies (<a>DeleteUserPolicy</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>Attached managed policies (<a>DetachUserPolicy</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>Group memberships (<a>RemoveUserFromGroup</a>)</p> </li> </ul>
* `GetDeleteUserPermissionsBoundary` - <p>Deletes the permissions boundary for the specified IAM user.</p> <important> <p>Deleting the permissions boundary for a user might increase its permissions by allowing the user to perform all the actions granted in its permissions policies. </p> </important>
* `GetDeleteUserPolicy` - <p>Deletes the specified inline policy that is embedded in the specified IAM user.</p> <p>A user can also have managed policies attached to it. To detach a managed policy from a user, use <a>DetachUserPolicy</a>. For more information about policies, refer to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed policies and inline policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetDeleteVirtualMfaDevice` - <p>Deletes a virtual MFA device.</p> <note> <p> You must deactivate a user's virtual MFA device before you can delete it. For information about deactivating MFA devices, see <a>DeactivateMFADevice</a>. </p> </note>
* `GetDetachGroupPolicy` - <p>Removes the specified managed policy from the specified IAM group.</p> <p>A group can also have inline policies embedded with it. To delete an inline policy, use <a>DeleteGroupPolicy</a>. For information about policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed policies and inline policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetDetachRolePolicy` - <p>Removes the specified managed policy from the specified role.</p> <p>A role can also have inline policies embedded with it. To delete an inline policy, use <a>DeleteRolePolicy</a>. For information about policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed policies and inline policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

To delete an inline policy, use <a>DeleteUserPolicy</a>. For information about policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed policies and inline policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetEnableMfaDevice` - Enables the specified MFA device and associates it with the specified IAM user. When enabled, the MFA device is required for every subsequent login by the IAM user associated with the device.
* `GetGenerateCredentialReport` -  Generates a credential report for the account. For more information about the credential report, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/credential-reports.html">Getting credential reports</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
* `GetGenerateOrganizationsAccessReport` - <p>Generates a report for service last accessed data for Organizations. You can generate a report for any entities (organization root, organizational unit, or account) or policies in your organization.</p> <p>To call this operation, you must be signed in using your Organizations management account credentials. You can use your long-term IAM user or root user credentials, or temporary credentials from assuming an IAM role. SCPs must be enabled for your organization root. You must have the required IAM and Organizations permissions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html">Refining permissions using service last accessed data</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can generate a service last accessed data report for entities by specifying only the entity's path. This data includes a list of services that are allowed by any service control policies (SCPs) that apply to the entity.</p> <p>You can generate a service last accessed data report for a policy by specifying an entity's path and an optional Organizations policy ID. This data includes a list of services that are allowed by the specified SCP.</p> <p>For each service in both report types, the data includes the most recent account activity that the policy allows to account principals in the entity or the entity's children. For important information about the data, reporting period, permissions required, troubleshooting, and supported Regions see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html">Reducing permissions using service last accessed data</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <important> <p>The data includes all attempts to access Amazon Web Services, not just the successful ones. This includes all attempts that were made using the Management Console, the Amazon Web Services API through any of the SDKs, or any of the command line tools. An unexpected entry in the service last accessed data does not mean that an account has been compromised, because the request might have been denied. Refer to your CloudTrail logs as the authoritative source for information about all API calls and whether they were successful or denied access. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/cloudtrail-integration.html">Logging IAM events with CloudTrail</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> </important> <p>This operation returns a <code>JobId</code>. Use this parameter in the <code> <a>GetOrganizationsAccessReport</a> </code> operation to check the status of the report generation. To check the status of this request, use the <code>JobId</code> parameter in the <code> <a>GetOrganizationsAccessReport</a> </code> operation and test the <code>JobStatus</code> response parameter. When the job is complete, you can retrieve the report.</p> <p>To generate a service last accessed data report for entities, specify an entity path without specifying the optional Organizations policy ID. The type of entity that you specify determines the data returned in the report.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Root</b> – When you specify the organizations root as the entity, the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are attached to your root. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in your organization except the management account, because the management account is not limited by SCPs.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>OU</b> – When you specify an organizational unit (OU) as the entity, the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are attached to the OU and its parents. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in the OU or its children. This data excludes the management account, because the management account is not limited by SCPs.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>management account</b> – When you specify the management account, the resulting report lists all Amazon Web Services services, because the management account is not limited by SCPs. For each service, the report includes data for only the management account.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Account</b> – When you specify another account as the entity, the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are attached to the account and its parents.

* `GetGenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails` - <p>Generates a report that includes details about when an IAM resource (user, group, role, or policy) was last used in an attempt to access Amazon Web Services services. Recent activity usually appears within four hours. IAM reports activity for the last 365 days, or less if your Region began supporting this feature within the last year. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#access-advisor_tracking-period">Regions where data is tracked</a>.</p> <important> <p>The service last accessed data includes all attempts to access an Amazon Web Services API, not just the successful ones. This includes all attempts that were made using the Management Console, the Amazon Web Services API through any of the SDKs, or any of the command line tools. An unexpected entry in the service last accessed data does not mean that your account has been compromised, because the request might have been denied. Refer to your CloudTrail logs as the authoritative source for information about all API calls and whether they were successful or denied access.

* `GetSetSecurityTokenServicePreferences` - <p>Sets the specified version of the global endpoint token as the token version used for the account.</p> <p>By default, Security Token Service (STS) is available as a global service, and all STS requests go to a single endpoint at <code>https://sts.amazonaws.com</code>. Amazon Web Services recommends using Regional STS endpoints to reduce latency, build in redundancy, and increase session token availability. For information about Regional endpoints for STS, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sts.html">Security Token Service endpoints and quotas</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> <p>If you make an STS call to the global endpoint, the resulting session tokens might be valid in some Regions but not others. It depends on the version that is set in this operation. Version 1 tokens are valid only in Regions that are available by default. These tokens do not work in manually enabled Regions, such as Asia Pacific (Hong Kong). Version 2 tokens are valid in all Regions. However, version 2 tokens are longer and might affect systems where you temporarily store tokens. For information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html">Activating and deactivating STS in an Region</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>To view the current session token version, see the <code>GlobalEndpointTokenVersion</code> entry in the response of the <a>GetAccountSummary</a> operation.</p>

* `GetUpdateAccountPasswordPolicy` - <p>Updates the password policy settings for the account.</p> <note> <ul> <li> <p>This operation does not support partial updates. No parameters are required, but if you do not specify a parameter, that parameter's value reverts to its default value. See the <b>Request Parameters</b> section for each parameter's default value. Also note that some parameters do not allow the default parameter to be explicitly set. Instead, to invoke the default value, do not include that parameter when you invoke the operation.</p> </li> </ul> </note> <p> For more information about using a password policy, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_ManagingPasswordPolicies.html">Managing an IAM password policy</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetUpdateAssumeRolePolicy` - Updates the policy that grants an IAM entity permission to assume a role. This is typically referred to as the "role trust policy". For more information about roles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-toplevel.html">Using roles to delegate permissions and federate identities</a>.
* `GetUpdateGroup` - <p>Updates the name and/or the path of the specified IAM group.</p> <important> <p> You should understand the implications of changing a group's path or name. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_WorkingWithGroupsAndUsers.html">Renaming users and groups</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> </important> <note> <p>The person making the request (the principal), must have permission to change the role group with the old name and the new name. For example, to change the group named <code>Managers</code> to <code>MGRs</code>, the principal must have a policy that allows them to update both groups. If the principal has permission to update the <code>Managers</code> group, but not the <code>MGRs</code> group, then the update fails. For more information about permissions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html">Access management</a>. </p> </note>
* `GetUpdateLoginProfile` - <p>Changes the password for the specified IAM user. You can use the CLI, the Amazon Web Services API, or the <b>Users</b> page in the IAM console to change the password for any IAM user. Use <a>ChangePassword</a> to change your own password in the <b>My Security Credentials</b> page in the Management Console.</p> <p>For more information about modifying passwords, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_ManagingLogins.html">Managing passwords</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetUpdateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint` - <p>Replaces the existing list of server certificate thumbprints associated with an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider resource object with a new list of thumbprints.</p> <p>The list that you pass with this operation completely replaces the existing list of thumbprints. (The lists are not merged.)</p> <p>Typically, you need to update a thumbprint only when the identity provider certificate changes, which occurs rarely. However, if the provider's certificate <i>does</i> change, any attempt to assume an IAM role that specifies the OIDC provider as a principal fails until the certificate thumbprint is updated.</p> <note> <p>Amazon Web Services secures communication with some OIDC identity providers (IdPs) through our library of trusted certificate authorities (CAs) instead of using a certificate thumbprint to verify your IdP server certificate. These OIDC IdPs include Google, and those that use an Amazon S3 bucket to host a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint. In these cases, your legacy thumbprint remains in your configuration, but is no longer used for validation.</p> </note> <note> <p>Trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the provider certificate and is validated by the thumbprint. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the <code>UpdateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint</code> operation to highly privileged users.</p> </note>
* `GetUpdateRole` - Updates the description or maximum session duration setting of a role.
* `GetUpdateRoleDescription` - <p>Use <a>UpdateRole</a> instead.</p> <p>Modifies only the description of a role. This operation performs the same function as the <code>Description</code> parameter in the <code>UpdateRole</code> operation.</p>
* `GetUpdateSamlProvider` - <p>Updates the metadata document for an existing SAML provider resource object.</p> <note> <p>This operation requires <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4</a>.</p> </note>
* `GetUpdateSSHPublicKey` - <p>Sets the status of an IAM user's SSH public key to active or inactive. SSH public keys that are inactive cannot be used for authentication. This operation can be used to disable a user's SSH public key as part of a key rotation work flow.</p> <p>The SSH public key affected by this operation is used only for authenticating the associated IAM user to an CodeCommit repository. For more information about using SSH keys to authenticate to an CodeCommit repository, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-credentials-ssh.html">Set up CodeCommit for SSH connections</a> in the <i>CodeCommit User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetUpdateServerCertificate` - <p>Updates the name and/or the path of the specified server certificate stored in IAM.</p> <p>For more information about working with server certificates, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html">Working with server certificates</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. This topic also includes a list of Amazon Web Services services that can use the server certificates that you manage with IAM.</p> <important> <p>You should understand the implications of changing a server certificate's path or name. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs_manage.html#RenamingServerCerts">Renaming a server certificate</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> </important> <note> <p>The person making the request (the principal), must have permission to change the server certificate with the old name and the new name. For example, to change the certificate named <code>ProductionCert</code> to <code>ProdCert</code>, the principal must have a policy that allows them to update both certificates. If the principal has permission to update the <code>ProductionCert</code> group, but not the <code>ProdCert</code> certificate, then the update fails. For more information about permissions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html">Access management</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> </note>
* `GetUpdateServiceSpecificCredential` - Sets the status of a service-specific credential to <code>Active</code> or <code>Inactive</code>. Service-specific credentials that are inactive cannot be used for authentication to the service. This operation can be used to disable a user's service-specific credential as part of a credential rotation work flow.
* `GetUpdateSigningCertificate` - <p>Changes the status of the specified user signing certificate from active to disabled, or vice versa. This operation can be used to disable an IAM user's signing certificate as part of a certificate rotation work flow.</p> <p>If the <code>UserName</code> field is not specified, the user name is determined implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID used to sign the request. This operation works for access keys under the account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage account root user credentials even if the account has no associated users.</p>
* `GetUpdateUser` - <p>Updates the name and/or the path of the specified IAM user.</p> <important> <p> You should understand the implications of changing an IAM user's path or name. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_manage.html#id_users_renaming">Renaming an IAM user</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups_manage_rename.html">Renaming an IAM group</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> </important> <note> <p> To change a user name, the requester must have appropriate permissions on both the source object and the target object. For example, to change Bob to Robert, the entity making the request must have permission on Bob and Robert, or must have permission on all (*). For more information about permissions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/PermissionsAndPolicies.html">Permissions and policies</a>. </p> </note>
* `GetUploadSSHPublicKey` - <p>Uploads an SSH public key and associates it with the specified IAM user.</p> <p>The SSH public key uploaded by this operation can be used only for authenticating the associated IAM user to an CodeCommit repository. For more information about using SSH keys to authenticate to an CodeCommit repository, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-credentials-ssh.html">Set up CodeCommit for SSH connections</a> in the <i>CodeCommit User Guide</i>.</p>
* `GetUploadSigningCertificate` - <p>Uploads an X.509 signing certificate and associates it with the specified IAM user. Some Amazon Web Services services require you to use certificates to validate requests that are signed with a corresponding private key. When you upload the certificate, its default status is <code>Active</code>.</p> <p>For information about when you would use an X.509 signing certificate, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html">Managing server certificates in IAM</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>If the <code>UserName</code> is not specified, the IAM user name is determined implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID used to sign the request. This operation works for access keys under the account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage account root user credentials even if the account has no associated users.</p> <note> <p>Because the body of an X.509 certificate can be large, you should use POST rather than GET when calling <code>UploadSigningCertificate</code>. For information about setting up signatures and authorization through the API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html">Signing Amazon Web Services API requests</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.

* `PostAddClientIDToOpenIDConnectProvider` - <p>Adds a new client ID (also known as audience) to the list of client IDs already registered for the specified IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider resource.</p> <p>This operation is idempotent; it does not fail or return an error if you add an existing client ID to the provider.</p>
* `PostAddRoleToInstanceProfile` - <p>Adds the specified IAM role to the specified instance profile. An instance profile can contain only one role, and this quota cannot be increased. You can remove the existing role and then add a different role to an instance profile. You must then wait for the change to appear across all of Amazon Web Services because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">eventual consistency</a>. To force the change, you must <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DisassociateIamInstanceProfile.html">disassociate the instance profile</a> and then <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_AssociateIamInstanceProfile.html">associate the instance profile</a>, or you can stop your instance and then restart it.</p> <note> <p>The caller of this operation must be granted the <code>PassRole</code> permission on the IAM role by a permissions policy.</p> </note> <p>For more information about roles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithRoles.html">Working with roles</a>. For more information about instance profiles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/AboutInstanceProfiles.html">About instance profiles</a>.</p>
* `PostAddUserToGroup` - Adds the specified user to the specified group.
* `PostAttachGroupPolicy` - <p>Attaches the specified managed policy to the specified IAM group.</p> <p>You use this operation to attach a managed policy to a group. To embed an inline policy in a group, use <a>PutGroupPolicy</a>.</p> <p>As a best practice, you can validate your IAM policies. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_policy-validator.html">Validating IAM policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information about policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed policies and inline policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostAttachRolePolicy` - <p>Attaches the specified managed policy to the specified IAM role. When you attach a managed policy to a role, the managed policy becomes part of the role's permission (access) policy.</p> <note> <p>You cannot use a managed policy as the role's trust policy. The role's trust policy is created at the same time as the role, using <a>CreateRole</a>. You can update a role's trust policy using <a>UpdateAssumeRolePolicy</a>.</p> </note> <p>Use this operation to attach a <i>managed</i> policy to a role. To embed an inline policy in a role, use <a>PutRolePolicy</a>. For more information about policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed policies and inline policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>As a best practice, you can validate your IAM policies. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_policy-validator.html">Validating IAM policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostAttachUserPolicy` - <p>Attaches the specified managed policy to the specified user.</p> <p>You use this operation to attach a <i>managed</i> policy to a user. To embed an inline policy in a user, use <a>PutUserPolicy</a>.</p> <p>As a best practice, you can validate your IAM policies. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_policy-validator.html">Validating IAM policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information about policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed policies and inline policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostChangePassword` - <p>Changes the password of the IAM user who is calling this operation. This operation can be performed using the CLI, the Amazon Web Services API, or the <b>My Security Credentials</b> page in the Management Console. The account root user password is not affected by this operation.</p> <p>Use <a>UpdateLoginProfile</a> to use the CLI, the Amazon Web Services API, or the <b>Users</b> page in the IAM console to change the password for any IAM user. For more information about modifying passwords, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_ManagingLogins.html">Managing passwords</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostCreateAccessKey` - <p> Creates a new Amazon Web Services secret access key and corresponding Amazon Web Services access key ID for the specified user. The default status for new keys is <code>Active</code>.</p> <p>If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID signing the request. This operation works for access keys under the account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage account root user credentials. This is true even if the account has no associated users.</p> <p> For information about quotas on the number of keys you can create, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html">IAM and STS quotas</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <important> <p>To ensure the security of your account, the secret access key is accessible only during key and user creation. You must save the key (for example, in a text file) if you want to be able to access it again. If a secret key is lost, you can delete the access keys for the associated user and then create new keys.</p> </important>
* `PostCreateAccountAlias` - Creates an alias for your account. For information about using an account alias, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/AccountAlias.html">Using an alias for your account ID</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
* `PostCreateGroup` - <p>Creates a new group.</p> <p> For information about the number of groups you can create, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html">IAM and STS quotas</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostCreateInstanceProfile` - <p> Creates a new instance profile. For information about instance profiles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html">Using roles for applications on Amazon EC2</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html#ec2-instance-profile">Instance profiles</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p> <p> For information about the number of instance profiles you can create, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html">IAM object quotas</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostCreateLoginProfile` - <p>Creates a password for the specified IAM user. A password allows an IAM user to access Amazon Web Services services through the Management Console.</p> <p>You can use the CLI, the Amazon Web Services API, or the <b>Users</b> page in the IAM console to create a password for any IAM user. Use <a>ChangePassword</a> to update your own existing password in the <b>My Security Credentials</b> page in the Management Console.</p> <p>For more information about managing passwords, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_ManagingLogins.html">Managing passwords</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostCreateOpenIDConnectProvider` - <p>Creates an IAM entity to describe an identity provider (IdP) that supports <a href="http://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect (OIDC)</a>.</p> <p>The OIDC provider that you create with this operation can be used as a principal in a role's trust policy. Such a policy establishes a trust relationship between Amazon Web Services and the OIDC provider.</p> <p>If you are using an OIDC identity provider from Google, Facebook, or Amazon Cognito, you don't need to create a separate IAM identity provider. These OIDC identity providers are already built-in to Amazon Web Services and are available for your use. Instead, you can move directly to creating new roles using your identity provider. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html">Creating a role for web identity or OpenID connect federation</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>When you create the IAM OIDC provider, you specify the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The URL of the OIDC identity provider (IdP) to trust</p> </li> <li> <p>A list of client IDs (also known as audiences) that identify the application or applications allowed to authenticate using the OIDC provider</p> </li> <li> <p>A list of thumbprints of one or more server certificates that the IdP uses</p> </li> </ul> <p>You get all of this information from the OIDC IdP that you want to use to access Amazon Web Services.</p> <note> <p>Amazon Web Services secures communication with some OIDC identity providers (IdPs) through our library of trusted certificate authorities (CAs) instead of using a certificate thumbprint to verify your IdP server certificate. These OIDC IdPs include Google, and those that use an Amazon S3 bucket to host a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint. In these cases, your legacy thumbprint remains in your configuration, but is no longer used for validation.</p> </note> <note> <p>The trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the IAM provider that this operation creates. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the <a>CreateOpenIDConnectProvider</a> operation to highly privileged users.</p> </note>
* `PostCreatePolicy` - <p>Creates a new managed policy for your account.</p> <p>This operation creates a policy version with a version identifier of <code>v1</code> and sets v1 as the policy's default version. For more information about policy versions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-versions.html">Versioning for managed policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>As a best practice, you can validate your IAM policies. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_policy-validator.html">Validating IAM policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For more information about managed policies in general, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed policies and inline policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostCreatePolicyVersion` - <p>Creates a new version of the specified managed policy. To update a managed policy, you create a new policy version. A managed policy can have up to five versions. If the policy has five versions, you must delete an existing version using <a>DeletePolicyVersion</a> before you create a new version.</p> <p>Optionally, you can set the new version as the policy's default version. The default version is the version that is in effect for the IAM users, groups, and roles to which the policy is attached.</p> <p>For more information about managed policy versions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-versions.html">Versioning for managed policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostCreateRole` - Creates a new role for your account. For more information about roles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithRoles.html">IAM roles</a>. For information about quotas for role names and the number of roles you can create, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html">IAM and STS quotas</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
* `PostCreateSamlProvider` - <p>Creates an IAM resource that describes an identity provider (IdP) that supports SAML 2.0.</p> <p>The SAML provider resource that you create with this operation can be used as a principal in an IAM role's trust policy. Such a policy can enable federated users who sign in using the SAML IdP to assume the role. You can create an IAM role that supports Web-based single sign-on (SSO) to the Management Console or one that supports API access to Amazon Web Services.</p> <p>When you create the SAML provider resource, you upload a SAML metadata document that you get from your IdP. That document includes the issuer's name, expiration information, and keys that can be used to validate the SAML authentication response (assertions) that the IdP sends. You must generate the metadata document using the identity management software that is used as your organization's IdP.</p> <note> <p> This operation requires <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4</a>.</p> </note> <p> For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-saml.html">Enabling SAML 2.0 federated users to access the Management Console</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml.html">About SAML 2.0-based federation</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostCreateServiceLinkedRole` - <p>Creates an IAM role that is linked to a specific Amazon Web Services service. The service controls the attached policies and when the role can be deleted. This helps ensure that the service is not broken by an unexpectedly changed or deleted role, which could put your Amazon Web Services resources into an unknown state. Allowing the service to control the role helps improve service stability and proper cleanup when a service and its role are no longer needed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html">Using service-linked roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p>To attach a policy to this service-linked role, you must make the request using the Amazon Web Services service that depends on this role.</p>
* `PostCreateServiceSpecificCredential` - <p>Generates a set of credentials consisting of a user name and password that can be used to access the service specified in the request. These credentials are generated by IAM, and can be used only for the specified service. </p> <p>You can have a maximum of two sets of service-specific credentials for each supported service per user.</p> <p>You can create service-specific credentials for CodeCommit and Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra).</p> <p>You can reset the password to a new service-generated value by calling <a>ResetServiceSpecificCredential</a>.</p> <p>For more information about service-specific credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_ssh-keys.html">Using IAM with CodeCommit: Git credentials, SSH keys, and Amazon Web Services access keys</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostCreateUser` - <p>Creates a new IAM user for your account.</p> <p> For information about quotas for the number of IAM users you can create, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html">IAM and STS quotas</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostCreateVirtualMfaDevice` - <p>Creates a new virtual MFA device for the account. After creating the virtual MFA, use <a>EnableMFADevice</a> to attach the MFA device to an IAM user. For more information about creating and working with virtual MFA devices, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_VirtualMFA.html">Using a virtual MFA device</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For information about the maximum number of MFA devices you can create, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html">IAM and STS quotas</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <important> <p>The seed information contained in the QR code and the Base32 string should be treated like any other secret access information. In other words, protect the seed information as you would your Amazon Web Services access keys or your passwords. After you provision your virtual device, you should ensure that the information is destroyed following secure procedures.</p> </important>
* `PostDeactivateMfaDevice` - <p>Deactivates the specified MFA device and removes it from association with the user name for which it was originally enabled.</p> <p>For more information about creating and working with virtual MFA devices, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_VirtualMFA.html">Enabling a virtual multi-factor authentication (MFA) device</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostDeleteAccessKey` - <p>Deletes the access key pair associated with the specified IAM user.</p> <p>If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID signing the request. This operation works for access keys under the account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage account root user credentials even if the account has no associated users.</p>
* `PostDeleteAccountAlias` -  Deletes the specified account alias. For information about using an Amazon Web Services account alias, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/AccountAlias.html">Using an alias for your account ID</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
* `PostDeleteAccountPasswordPolicy` - Deletes the password policy for the account. There are no parameters.
* `PostDeleteGroup` - Deletes the specified IAM group. The group must not contain any users or have any attached policies.
* `PostDeleteGroupPolicy` - <p>Deletes the specified inline policy that is embedded in the specified IAM group.</p> <p>A group can also have managed policies attached to it. To detach a managed policy from a group, use <a>DetachGroupPolicy</a>. For more information about policies, refer to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed policies and inline policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostDeleteInstanceProfile` - <p>Deletes the specified instance profile. The instance profile must not have an associated role.</p> <important> <p>Make sure that you do not have any Amazon EC2 instances running with the instance profile you are about to delete. Deleting a role or instance profile that is associated with a running instance will break any applications running on the instance.</p> </important> <p>For more information about instance profiles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/AboutInstanceProfiles.html">About instance profiles</a>.</p>
* `PostDeleteLoginProfile` - <p>Deletes the password for the specified IAM user, which terminates the user's ability to access Amazon Web Services services through the Management Console.</p> <p>You can use the CLI, the Amazon Web Services API, or the <b>Users</b> page in the IAM console to delete a password for any IAM user. You can use <a>ChangePassword</a> to update, but not delete, your own password in the <b>My Security Credentials</b> page in the Management Console.</p> <important> <p> Deleting a user's password does not prevent a user from accessing Amazon Web Services through the command line interface or the API. To prevent all user access, you must also either make any access keys inactive or delete them. For more information about making keys inactive or deleting them, see <a>UpdateAccessKey</a> and <a>DeleteAccessKey</a>. </p> </important>
* `PostDeleteOpenIDConnectProvider` - <p>Deletes an OpenID Connect identity provider (IdP) resource object in IAM.</p> <p>Deleting an IAM OIDC provider resource does not update any roles that reference the provider as a principal in their trust policies. Any attempt to assume a role that references a deleted provider fails.</p> <p>This operation is idempotent; it does not fail or return an error if you call the operation for a provider that does not exist.</p>
* `PostDeletePolicy` - <p>Deletes the specified managed policy.</p> <p>Before you can delete a managed policy, you must first detach the policy from all users, groups, and roles that it is attached to. In addition, you must delete all the policy's versions. The following steps describe the process for deleting a managed policy:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Detach the policy from all users, groups, and roles that the policy is attached to, using <a>DetachUserPolicy</a>, <a>DetachGroupPolicy</a>, or <a>DetachRolePolicy</a>. To list all the users, groups, and roles that a policy is attached to, use <a>ListEntitiesForPolicy</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Delete all versions of the policy using <a>DeletePolicyVersion</a>. To list the policy's versions, use <a>ListPolicyVersions</a>. You cannot use <a>DeletePolicyVersion</a> to delete the version that is marked as the default version. You delete the policy's default version in the next step of the process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Delete the policy (this automatically deletes the policy's default version) using this operation.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For information about managed policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed policies and inline policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostDeletePolicyVersion` - <p>Deletes the specified version from the specified managed policy.</p> <p>You cannot delete the default version from a policy using this operation. To delete the default version from a policy, use <a>DeletePolicy</a>. To find out which version of a policy is marked as the default version, use <a>ListPolicyVersions</a>.</p> <p>For information about versions for managed policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-versions.html">Versioning for managed policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostDeleteRole` - <p>Deletes the specified role. The role must not have any policies attached. For more information about roles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithRoles.html">Working with roles</a>.</p> <important> <p>Make sure that you do not have any Amazon EC2 instances running with the role you are about to delete. Deleting a role or instance profile that is associated with a running instance will break any applications running on the instance.</p> </important>
* `PostDeleteRolePermissionsBoundary` - <p>Deletes the permissions boundary for the specified IAM role. </p> <important> <p>Deleting the permissions boundary for a role might increase its permissions. For example, it might allow anyone who assumes the role to perform all the actions granted in its permissions policies. </p> </important>
* `PostDeleteRolePolicy` - <p>Deletes the specified inline policy that is embedded in the specified IAM role.</p> <p>A role can also have managed policies attached to it. To detach a managed policy from a role, use <a>DetachRolePolicy</a>. For more information about policies, refer to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed policies and inline policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostDeleteSamlProvider` - <p>Deletes a SAML provider resource in IAM.</p> <p>Deleting the provider resource from IAM does not update any roles that reference the SAML provider resource's ARN as a principal in their trust policies. Any attempt to assume a role that references a non-existent provider resource ARN fails.</p> <note> <p> This operation requires <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4</a>.</p> </note>
* `PostDeleteSSHPublicKey` - <p>Deletes the specified SSH public key.</p> <p>The SSH public key deleted by this operation is used only for authenticating the associated IAM user to an CodeCommit repository. For more information about using SSH keys to authenticate to an CodeCommit repository, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-credentials-ssh.html">Set up CodeCommit for SSH connections</a> in the <i>CodeCommit User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostDeleteServerCertificate` - <p>Deletes the specified server certificate.</p> <p>For more information about working with server certificates, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html">Working with server certificates</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. This topic also includes a list of Amazon Web Services services that can use the server certificates that you manage with IAM.</p> <important> <p> If you are using a server certificate with Elastic Load Balancing, deleting the certificate could have implications for your application. If Elastic Load Balancing doesn't detect the deletion of bound certificates, it may continue to use the certificates. This could cause Elastic Load Balancing to stop accepting traffic. We recommend that you remove the reference to the certificate from Elastic Load Balancing before using this command to delete the certificate.

* `PostDeleteServiceLinkedRole` - <p>Submits a service-linked role deletion request and returns a <code>DeletionTaskId</code>, which you can use to check the status of the deletion. Before you call this operation, confirm that the role has no active sessions and that any resources used by the role in the linked service are deleted. If you call this operation more than once for the same service-linked role and an earlier deletion task is not complete, then the <code>DeletionTaskId</code> of the earlier request is returned.</p> <p>If you submit a deletion request for a service-linked role whose linked service is still accessing a resource, then the deletion task fails. If it fails, the <a>GetServiceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus</a> operation returns the reason for the failure, usually including the resources that must be deleted. To delete the service-linked role, you must first remove those resources from the linked service and then submit the deletion request again. Resources are specific to the service that is linked to the role. For more information about removing resources from a service, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services documentation</a> for your service.</p> <p>For more information about service-linked roles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role">Roles terms and concepts: Amazon Web Services service-linked role</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostDeleteServiceSpecificCredential` - Deletes the specified service-specific credential.
* `PostDeleteSigningCertificate` - <p>Deletes a signing certificate associated with the specified IAM user.</p> <p>If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID signing the request. This operation works for access keys under the account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage account root user credentials even if the account has no associated IAM users.</p>
* `PostDeleteUser` - <p>Deletes the specified IAM user. Unlike the Management Console, when you delete a user programmatically, you must delete the items attached to the user manually, or the deletion fails. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_manage.html#id_users_deleting_cli">Deleting an IAM user</a>.

* `PostResyncMfaDevice` - <p>Synchronizes the specified MFA device with its IAM resource object on the Amazon Web Services servers.</p> <p>For more information about creating and working with virtual MFA devices, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_VirtualMFA.html">Using a virtual MFA device</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostSetDefaultPolicyVersion` - <p>Sets the specified version of the specified policy as the policy's default (operative) version.</p> <p>This operation affects all users, groups, and roles that the policy is attached to. To list the users, groups, and roles that the policy is attached to, use <a>ListEntitiesForPolicy</a>.</p> <p>For information about managed policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed policies and inline policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostSetSecurityTokenServicePreferences` - <p>Sets the specified version of the global endpoint token as the token version used for the account.</p> <p>By default, Security Token Service (STS) is available as a global service, and all STS requests go to a single endpoint at <code>https://sts.amazonaws.com</code>. Amazon Web Services recommends using Regional STS endpoints to reduce latency, build in redundancy, and increase session token availability. For information about Regional endpoints for STS, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sts.html">Security Token Service endpoints and quotas</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> <p>If you make an STS call to the global endpoint, the resulting session tokens might be valid in some Regions but not others. It depends on the version that is set in this operation. Version 1 tokens are valid only in Regions that are available by default. These tokens do not work in manually enabled Regions, such as Asia Pacific (Hong Kong). Version 2 tokens are valid in all Regions. However, version 2 tokens are longer and might affect systems where you temporarily store tokens. For information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html">Activating and deactivating STS in an Region</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>To view the current session token version, see the <code>GlobalEndpointTokenVersion</code> entry in the response of the <a>GetAccountSummary</a> operation.</p>
* `PostSimulateCustomPolicy` - <p>Simulate how a set of IAM policies and optionally a resource-based policy works with a list of API operations and Amazon Web Services resources to determine the policies' effective permissions. The policies are provided as strings.</p> <p>The simulation does not perform the API operations; it only checks the authorization to determine if the simulated policies allow or deny the operations. You can simulate resources that don't exist in your account.</p> <p>If you want to simulate existing policies that are attached to an IAM user, group, or role, use <a>SimulatePrincipalPolicy</a> instead.</p> <p>Context keys are variables that are maintained by Amazon Web Services and its services and which provide details about the context of an API query request. You can use the <code>Condition</code> element of an IAM policy to evaluate context keys. To get the list of context keys that the policies require for correct simulation, use <a>GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy</a>.</p> <p>If the output is long, you can use <code>MaxItems</code> and <code>Marker</code> parameters to paginate the results.</p> <p>For more information about using the policy simulator, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_testing-policies.html">Testing IAM policies with the IAM policy simulator </a>in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostSimulatePrincipalPolicy` - <p>Simulate how a set of IAM policies attached to an IAM entity works with a list of API operations and Amazon Web Services resources to determine the policies' effective permissions. The entity can be an IAM user, group, or role. If you specify a user, then the simulation also includes all of the policies that are attached to groups that the user belongs to. You can simulate resources that don't exist in your account.</p> <p>You can optionally include a list of one or more additional policies specified as strings to include in the simulation. If you want to simulate only policies specified as strings, use <a>SimulateCustomPolicy</a> instead.</p> <p>You can also optionally include one resource-based policy to be evaluated with each of the resources included in the simulation.</p> <p>The simulation does not perform the API operations; it only checks the authorization to determine if the simulated policies allow or deny the operations.</p> <p> <b>Note:</b> This operation discloses information about the permissions granted to other users. If you do not want users to see other user's permissions, then consider allowing them to use <a>SimulateCustomPolicy</a> instead.</p> <p>Context keys are variables maintained by Amazon Web Services and its services that provide details about the context of an API query request. You can use the <code>Condition</code> element of an IAM policy to evaluate context keys. To get the list of context keys that the policies require for correct simulation, use <a>GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy</a>.</p> <p>If the output is long, you can use the <code>MaxItems</code> and <code>Marker</code> parameters to paginate the results.</p> <p>For more information about using the policy simulator, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_testing-policies.html">Testing IAM policies with the IAM policy simulator </a>in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

No parameters are required, but if you do not specify a parameter, that parameter's value reverts to its default value. See the <b>Request Parameters</b> section for each parameter's default value. Also note that some parameters do not allow the default parameter to be explicitly set. Instead, to invoke the default value, do not include that parameter when you invoke the operation.</p> </li> </ul> </note> <p> For more information about using a password policy, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_ManagingPasswordPolicies.html">Managing an IAM password policy</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostUpdateAssumeRolePolicy` - Updates the policy that grants an IAM entity permission to assume a role. This is typically referred to as the "role trust policy". For more information about roles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-toplevel.html">Using roles to delegate permissions and federate identities</a>.
* `PostUpdateGroup` - <p>Updates the name and/or the path of the specified IAM group.</p> <important> <p> You should understand the implications of changing a group's path or name. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_WorkingWithGroupsAndUsers.html">Renaming users and groups</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> </important> <note> <p>The person making the request (the principal), must have permission to change the role group with the old name and the new name. For example, to change the group named <code>Managers</code> to <code>MGRs</code>, the principal must have a policy that allows them to update both groups. If the principal has permission to update the <code>Managers</code> group, but not the <code>MGRs</code> group, then the update fails. For more information about permissions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html">Access management</a>. </p> </note>
* `PostUpdateLoginProfile` - <p>Changes the password for the specified IAM user. You can use the CLI, the Amazon Web Services API, or the <b>Users</b> page in the IAM console to change the password for any IAM user. Use <a>ChangePassword</a> to change your own password in the <b>My Security Credentials</b> page in the Management Console.</p> <p>For more information about modifying passwords, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_ManagingLogins.html">Managing passwords</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostUpdateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint` - <p>Replaces the existing list of server certificate thumbprints associated with an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider resource object with a new list of thumbprints.</p> <p>The list that you pass with this operation completely replaces the existing list of thumbprints. (The lists are not merged.)</p> <p>Typically, you need to update a thumbprint only when the identity provider certificate changes, which occurs rarely. However, if the provider's certificate <i>does</i> change, any attempt to assume an IAM role that specifies the OIDC provider as a principal fails until the certificate thumbprint is updated.</p> <note> <p>Amazon Web Services secures communication with some OIDC identity providers (IdPs) through our library of trusted certificate authorities (CAs) instead of using a certificate thumbprint to verify your IdP server certificate. These OIDC IdPs include Google, and those that use an Amazon S3 bucket to host a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint. In these cases, your legacy thumbprint remains in your configuration, but is no longer used for validation.</p> </note> <note> <p>Trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the provider certificate and is validated by the thumbprint. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the <code>UpdateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint</code> operation to highly privileged users.</p> </note>
* `PostUpdateRole` - Updates the description or maximum session duration setting of a role.
* `PostUpdateRoleDescription` - <p>Use <a>UpdateRole</a> instead.</p> <p>Modifies only the description of a role. This operation performs the same function as the <code>Description</code> parameter in the <code>UpdateRole</code> operation.</p>
* `PostUpdateSamlProvider` - <p>Updates the metadata document for an existing SAML provider resource object.</p> <note> <p>This operation requires <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4</a>.</p> </note>
* `PostUpdateSSHPublicKey` - <p>Sets the status of an IAM user's SSH public key to active or inactive. SSH public keys that are inactive cannot be used for authentication. This operation can be used to disable a user's SSH public key as part of a key rotation work flow.</p> <p>The SSH public key affected by this operation is used only for authenticating the associated IAM user to an CodeCommit repository. For more information about using SSH keys to authenticate to an CodeCommit repository, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-credentials-ssh.html">Set up CodeCommit for SSH connections</a> in the <i>CodeCommit User Guide</i>.</p>

For example, to change the certificate named <code>ProductionCert</code> to <code>ProdCert</code>, the principal must have a policy that allows them to update both certificates. If the principal has permission to update the <code>ProductionCert</code> group, but not the <code>ProdCert</code> certificate, then the update fails. For more information about permissions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html">Access management</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> </note>
* `PostUpdateServiceSpecificCredential` - Sets the status of a service-specific credential to <code>Active</code> or <code>Inactive</code>. Service-specific credentials that are inactive cannot be used for authentication to the service. This operation can be used to disable a user's service-specific credential as part of a credential rotation work flow.
* `PostUpdateSigningCertificate` - <p>Changes the status of the specified user signing certificate from active to disabled, or vice versa. This operation can be used to disable an IAM user's signing certificate as part of a certificate rotation work flow.</p> <p>If the <code>UserName</code> field is not specified, the user name is determined implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID used to sign the request. This operation works for access keys under the account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage account root user credentials even if the account has no associated users.</p>
* `PostUpdateUser` - <p>Updates the name and/or the path of the specified IAM user.</p> <important> <p> You should understand the implications of changing an IAM user's path or name. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_manage.html#id_users_renaming">Renaming an IAM user</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups_manage_rename.html">Renaming an IAM group</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> </important> <note> <p> To change a user name, the requester must have appropriate permissions on both the source object and the target object. For example, to change Bob to Robert, the entity making the request must have permission on Bob and Robert, or must have permission on all (*). For more information about permissions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/PermissionsAndPolicies.html">Permissions and policies</a>. </p> </note>
* `PostUploadSSHPublicKey` - <p>Uploads an SSH public key and associates it with the specified IAM user.</p> <p>The SSH public key uploaded by this operation can be used only for authenticating the associated IAM user to an CodeCommit repository. For more information about using SSH keys to authenticate to an CodeCommit repository, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-credentials-ssh.html">Set up CodeCommit for SSH connections</a> in the <i>CodeCommit User Guide</i>.</p>
* `PostUploadServerCertificate` - <p>Uploads a server certificate entity for the account. The server certificate entity includes a public key certificate, a private key, and an optional certificate chain, which should all be PEM-encoded.</p> <p>We recommend that you use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/">Certificate Manager</a> to provision, manage, and deploy your server certificates. With ACM you can request a certificate, deploy it to Amazon Web Services resources, and let ACM handle certificate renewals for you. Certificates provided by ACM are free. For more information about using ACM, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/">Certificate Manager User Guide</a>.</p> <p>For more information about working with server certificates, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html">Working with server certificates</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. This topic includes a list of Amazon Web Services services that can use the server certificates that you manage with IAM.</p> <p>For information about the number of server certificates you can upload, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html">IAM and STS quotas</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>Because the body of the public key certificate, private key, and the certificate chain can be large, you should use POST rather than GET when calling <code>UploadServerCertificate</code>. For information about setting up signatures and authorization through the API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html">Signing Amazon Web Services API requests</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>. For general information about using the Query API with IAM, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/programming.html">Calling the API by making HTTP query requests</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> </note>
* `PostUploadSigningCertificate` - <p>Uploads an X.509 signing certificate and associates it with the specified IAM user. Some Amazon Web Services services require you to use certificates to validate requests that are signed with a corresponding private key. When you upload the certificate, its default status is <code>Active</code>.</p> <p>For information about when you would use an X.509 signing certificate, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html">Managing server certificates in IAM</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>If the <code>UserName</code> is not specified, the IAM user name is determined implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID used to sign the request. This operation works for access keys under the account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage account root user credentials even if the account has no associated users.</p> <note> <p>Because the body of an X.509 certificate can be large, you should use POST rather than GET when calling <code>UploadSigningCertificate</code>.
