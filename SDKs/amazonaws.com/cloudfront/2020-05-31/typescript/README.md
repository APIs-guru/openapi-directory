## SDK Available Operations

### SDK SDK

* `associateAlias20200531` - <p>Associates an alias (also known as a CNAME or an alternate domain name) with a CloudFront distribution.</p> <p>With this operation you can move an alias that’s already in use on a CloudFront distribution to a different distribution in one step. This prevents the downtime that could occur if you first remove the alias from one distribution and then separately add the alias to another distribution.</p> <p>To use this operation to associate an alias with a distribution, you provide the alias and the ID of the target distribution for the alias. For more information, including how to set up the target distribution, prerequisites that you must complete, and other restrictions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html#alternate-domain-names-move">Moving an alternate domain name to a different distribution</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide</i>.</p>
* `createCachePolicy20200531` - <p>Creates a cache policy.</p> <p>After you create a cache policy, you can attach it to one or more cache behaviors. When it’s attached to a cache behavior, the cache policy determines the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The values that CloudFront includes in the <i>cache key</i>. These values can include HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings. CloudFront uses the cache key to find an object in its cache that it can return to the viewer.</p> </li> <li> <p>The default, minimum, and maximum time to live (TTL) values that you want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The headers, cookies, and query strings that are included in the cache key are automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. CloudFront sends a request when it can’t find an object in its cache that matches the request’s cache key. If you want to send values to the origin but <i>not</i> include them in the cache key, use <code>OriginRequestPolicy</code>.</p> <p>For more information about cache policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html">Controlling the cache key</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide</i>.</p>
* `createCloudFrontOriginAccessIdentity20200531` - Creates a new origin access identity. If you're using Amazon S3 for your origin, you can use an origin access identity to require users to access your content using a CloudFront URL instead of the Amazon S3 URL. For more information about how to use origin access identities, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html">Serving Private Content through CloudFront</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide</i>.
* `createDistribution20200531` - <p>Creates a new web distribution. You create a CloudFront distribution to tell CloudFront where you want content to be delivered from, and the details about how to track and manage content delivery. Send a <code>POST</code> request to the <code>/<i>CloudFront API version</i>/distribution</code>/<code>distribution ID</code> resource.</p> <important> <p>When you update a distribution, there are more required fields than when you create a distribution. When you update your distribution by using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDistribution.html">UpdateDistribution</a>, follow the steps included in the documentation to get the current configuration and then make your updates. This helps to make sure that you include all of the required fields. To view a summary, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-overview-required-fields.html">Required Fields for Create Distribution and Update Distribution</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide</i>.</p> </important>
* `createDistributionWithTags20200531` - Create a new distribution with tags.
* `createFieldLevelEncryptionConfig20200531` - Create a new field-level encryption configuration.
* `createFieldLevelEncryptionProfile20200531` - Create a field-level encryption profile.
* `createFunction20200531` - <p>Creates a CloudFront function.</p> <p>To create a function, you provide the function code and some configuration information about the function. The response contains an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the function.</p> <p>When you create a function, it’s in the <code>DEVELOPMENT</code> stage. In this stage, you can test the function with <code>TestFunction</code>, and update it with <code>UpdateFunction</code>.</p> <p>When you’re ready to use your function with a CloudFront distribution, use <code>PublishFunction</code> to copy the function from the <code>DEVELOPMENT</code> stage to <code>LIVE</code>. When it’s live, you can attach the function to a distribution’s cache behavior, using the function’s ARN.</p>
* `createInvalidation20200531` - Create a new invalidation. 
* `createKeyGroup20200531` - <p>Creates a key group that you can use with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html">CloudFront signed URLs and signed cookies</a>.</p> <p>To create a key group, you must specify at least one public key for the key group. After you create a key group, you can reference it from one or more cache behaviors. When you reference a key group in a cache behavior, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html">Serving private content</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide</i>.</p>
* `createMonitoringSubscription20200531` - <p>Enables additional CloudWatch metrics for the specified CloudFront distribution. The additional metrics incur an additional cost.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/viewing-cloudfront-metrics.html#monitoring-console.distributions-additional">Viewing additional CloudFront distribution metrics</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide</i>.</p>
* `createOriginRequestPolicy20200531` - <p>Creates an origin request policy.</p> <p>After you create an origin request policy, you can attach it to one or more cache behaviors. When it’s attached to a cache behavior, the origin request policy determines the values that CloudFront includes in requests that it sends to the origin. Each request that CloudFront sends to the origin includes the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The request body and the URL path (without the domain name) from the viewer request.</p> </li> <li> <p>The headers that CloudFront automatically includes in every origin request, including <code>Host</code>, <code>User-Agent</code>, and <code>X-Amz-Cf-Id</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>All HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings that are specified in the cache policy or the origin request policy. These can include items from the viewer request and, in the case of headers, additional ones that are added by CloudFront.</p> </li> </ul> <p>CloudFront sends a request when it can’t find a valid object in its cache that matches the request. If you want to send values to the origin and also include them in the cache key, use <code>CachePolicy</code>.</p> <p>For more information about origin request policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html">Controlling origin requests</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide</i>.</p>
* `createPublicKey20200531` - Uploads a public key to CloudFront that you can use with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html">signed URLs and signed cookies</a>, or with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/field-level-encryption.html">field-level encryption</a>.
* `createRealtimeLogConfig20200531` - <p>Creates a real-time log configuration.</p> <p>After you create a real-time log configuration, you can attach it to one or more cache behaviors to send real-time log data to the specified Amazon Kinesis data stream.</p> <p>For more information about real-time log configurations, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/real-time-logs.html">Real-time logs</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide</i>.</p>
