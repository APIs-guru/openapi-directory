The <code>Signer</code> element also includes the IDs of any active CloudFront key pairs that are associated with the trusted signer's AWS account. If no <code>KeyPairId</code> element appears for a <code>Signer</code>, that signer can't create signed URLs. </p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html\">Serving Private Content through CloudFront</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide</i>.</p>
