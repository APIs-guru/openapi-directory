 * <p>Use this structure to allow <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations">cryptographic operations</a> in the grant only when the operation request includes the specified <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context">encryption context</a>. </p> <p>KMS applies the grant constraints only to cryptographic operations that support an encryption context, that is, all cryptographic operations with a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symm-asymm-concepts.html#symmetric-cmks">symmetric KMS key</a>. Grant constraints are not applied to operations that do not support an encryption context, such as cryptographic operations with asymmetric KMS keys and management operations, such as <a>DescribeKey</a> or <a>RetireGrant</a>.</p> <important> <p>In a cryptographic operation, the encryption context in the decryption operation must be an exact, case-sensitive match for the keys and values in the encryption context of the encryption operation. Only the order of the pairs can vary.</p> <p>However, in a grant constraint, the key in each key-value pair is not case sensitive, but the value is case sensitive.</p> <p>To avoid confusion, do not use multiple encryption context pairs that differ only by case. To require a fully case-sensitive encryption context, use the <code>kms:EncryptionContext:</code> and <code>kms:EncryptionContextKeys</code> conditions in an IAM or key policy. For details, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/policy-conditions.html#conditions-kms-encryption-context">kms:EncryptionContext:</a> in the <i> <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i> </i>.</p> </important>
