/**
 * <p>An object that defines the tags associated with an application. A <i>tag</i> is a label that you optionally define and associate with an application. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.</p> <p>Each tag consists of a required <i>tag key</i> and an associated <i>tag value</i>, both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Tag keys and values are case sensitive.</p> </li> <li> <p>For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only one value.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>aws:</code> prefix is reserved for use by AWS; you canâ€™t use it in any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can't edit or remove tag keys or values that use this prefix. </p> </li> </ul>
