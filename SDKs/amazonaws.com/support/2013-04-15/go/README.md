### SDK SDK

* `AddAttachmentsToSet` - <p>Adds one or more attachments to an attachment set. </p> <p>An attachment set is a temporary container for attachments that you add to a case or case communication. The set is available for 1 hour after it's created. The <code>expiryTime</code> returned in the response is when the set expires. </p> <note> <ul> <li> <p>You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support API. </p> </li> <li> <p>If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, the <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS Support</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </note>
* `AddCommunicationToCase` - <p>Adds additional customer communication to an AWS Support case. Use the <code>caseId</code> parameter to identify the case to which to add communication. You can list a set of email addresses to copy on the communication by using the <code>ccEmailAddresses</code> parameter. The <code>communicationBody</code> value contains the text of the communication.</p> <note> <ul> <li> <p>You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support API. </p> </li> <li> <p>If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, the <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS Support</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </note>
* `CreateCase` - <p>Creates a case in the AWS Support Center. This operation is similar to how you create a case in the AWS Support Center <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create">Create Case</a> page.</p> <p>The AWS Support API doesn't support requesting service limit increases. You can submit a service limit increase in the following ways: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Submit a request from the AWS Support Center <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create">Create Case</a> page.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the Service Quotas <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/2019-06-24/apireference/API_RequestServiceQuotaIncrease.html">RequestServiceQuotaIncrease</a> operation.</p> </li> </ul> <p>A successful <code>CreateCase</code> request returns an AWS Support case number. You can use the <a>DescribeCases</a> operation and specify the case number to get existing AWS Support cases. After you create a case, use the <a>AddCommunicationToCase</a> operation to add additional communication or attachments to an existing case.</p> <p>The <code>caseId</code> is separate from the <code>displayId</code> that appears in the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support">AWS Support Center</a>. Use the <a>DescribeCases</a> operation to get the <code>displayId</code>.</p> <note> <ul> <li> <p>You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support API. </p> </li> <li> <p>If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, the <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS Support</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </note>
* `DescribeAttachment` - <p>Returns the attachment that has the specified ID. Attachments can include screenshots, error logs, or other files that describe your issue. Attachment IDs are generated by the case management system when you add an attachment to a case or case communication. Attachment IDs are returned in the <a>AttachmentDetails</a> objects that are returned by the <a>DescribeCommunications</a> operation.</p> <note> <ul> <li> <p>You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support API. </p> </li> <li> <p>If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, the <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS Support</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </note>
* `DescribeCases` - <p>Returns a list of cases that you specify by passing one or more case IDs. You can use the <code>afterTime</code> and <code>beforeTime</code> parameters to filter the cases by date. You can set values for the <code>includeResolvedCases</code> and <code>includeCommunications</code> parameters to specify how much information to return.</p> <p>The response returns the following in JSON format:</p> <ul> <li> <p>One or more <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/APIReference/API_CaseDetails.html">CaseDetails</a> data types.</p> </li> <li> <p>One or more <code>nextToken</code> values, which specify where to paginate the returned records represented by the <code>CaseDetails</code> objects.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Case data is available for 12 months after creation. If a case was created more than 12 months ago, a request might return an error.</p> <note> <ul> <li> <p>You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support API. </p> </li> <li> <p>If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, the <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS Support</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </note>
* `DescribeCommunications` - <p>Returns communications and attachments for one or more support cases. Use the <code>afterTime</code> and <code>beforeTime</code> parameters to filter by date. You can use the <code>caseId</code> parameter to restrict the results to a specific case.</p> <p>Case data is available for 12 months after creation. If a case was created more than 12 months ago, a request for data might cause an error.</p> <p>You can use the <code>maxResults</code> and <code>nextToken</code> parameters to control the pagination of the results. Set <code>maxResults</code> to the number of cases that you want to display on each page, and use <code>nextToken</code> to specify the resumption of pagination.</p> <note> <ul> <li> <p>You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support API. </p> </li> <li> <p>If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, the <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS Support</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </note>
* `DescribeServices` - <p>Returns the current list of AWS services and a list of service categories for each service. You then use service names and categories in your <a>CreateCase</a> requests. Each AWS service has its own set of categories.</p> <p>The service codes and category codes correspond to the values that appear in the <b>Service</b> and <b>Category</b> lists on the AWS Support Center <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create">Create Case</a> page. The values in those fields don't necessarily match the service codes and categories returned by the <code>DescribeServices</code> operation. Always use the service codes and categories that the <code>DescribeServices</code> operation returns, so that you have the most recent set of service and category codes.</p> <note> <ul> <li> <p>You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support API. </p> </li> <li> <p>If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, the <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS Support</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </note>
* `DescribeSeverityLevels` - <p>Returns the list of severity levels that you can assign to a support case. The severity level for a case is also a field in the <a>CaseDetails</a> data type that you include for a <a>CreateCase</a> request.</p> <note> <ul> <li> <p>You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support API. </p> </li> <li> <p>If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, the <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS Support</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </note>
* `DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses` - <p>Returns the refresh status of the AWS Trusted Advisor checks that have the specified check IDs.
