### SDK SDK

* `get_routing_control_state` - <p>Get the state for a routing control. A routing control is a simple on/off switch that you can use to route traffic to cells. When the state is On, traffic flows to a cell. When it's off, traffic does not flow. </p> <p>Before you can create a routing control, you first must create a cluster to host the control. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/recovery-cluster/latest/api/cluster.html">CreateCluster</a>. Access one of the endpoints for the cluster to get or update the routing control state to redirect traffic.</p> <p>For more information about working with routing controls, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.html">Routing control</a> in the Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.</p>
* `update_routing_control_state` - <p>Set the state of the routing control to reroute traffic. You can set the value to be On or Off. When the state is On, traffic flows to a cell. When it's off, traffic does not flow.</p> <p>For more information about working with routing controls, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.html">Routing control</a> in the Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.</p>
* `update_routing_control_states` - <p>Set multiple routing control states. You can set the value for each state to be On or Off. When the state is On, traffic flows to a cell. When it's off, traffic does not flow.</p> <p>For more information about working with routing controls, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.html">Routing control</a> in the Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.</p>
