     * getSchedulesScheduleE -
     * Schedule E covers the line item expenditures for independent expenditures. For example, if a super PAC
     * bought ads on TV to oppose a federal candidate, each ad purchase would be recorded here with
     * the expenditure amount, name and id of the candidate, and whether the ad supported or opposed the candidate.
     *
     * An independent expenditure is an expenditure for a communication "expressly advocating the election or
     * defeat of a clearly identified candidate that is not made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with,
     * or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidateâ€™s authorized committee, or their agents, or
     * a political party or its agents."
     *
     * Aggregates by candidate do not include 24 and 48 hour reports. This ensures we don't double count expenditures
     * and the totals are more accurate. You can still find the information from 24 and 48 hour reports in
     * `/schedule/schedule_e/`.
     *
     * Due to the large quantity of Schedule E filings, this endpoint is not paginated by
     * page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in
     * the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For
     * example, when sorting by `expenditure_amount`, you might receive a page of
     * results with the following pagination information:
     *
     * ```
     *  "pagination": {
     *     "count": 152623,
     *     "last_indexes": {
     *       "last_index": "3023037",
     *       "last_expenditure_amount": -17348.5
     *     },
     *     "per_page": 20,
     *     "pages": 7632
     *   }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=3023037` and
     * `last_expenditure_amount=` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through
     * these results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date,
     * e.g. `last_disbursement_date`), otherwise some resources may be unintentionally
     * filtered out.  This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance
     * and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset.
     *
     * Note: because the Schedule E data includes many records, counts for
     * large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.
     *
