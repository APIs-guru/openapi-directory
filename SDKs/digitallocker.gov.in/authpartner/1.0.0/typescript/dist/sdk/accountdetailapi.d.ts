     * Client applications can call this API to get the DigiLocker Id, name, date of birth and gender of the account holder. An access token is required to call this API. The API will return the user details of the account with which the access token is linked. It is strongly recommended that the API can be called by client application only once after acquiring the access token. Since the user details do not change, the client application may store the values and use them when necessary than calling this API repeatedly.
