     * The client device calls the DigiLocker API to get the device code by providing the client_id issued to the device OEM and either the username or the mobile number of the user. DigiLocker responds with a device code and then sends an OTP on the mobile number and email address associated with the userâ€™s account. The masked mobile number and email address is also sent in response. The device should use these values to notify the users about the mobile and email address on which the OTP has been sent.
