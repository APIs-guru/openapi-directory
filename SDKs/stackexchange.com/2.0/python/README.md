### SDK SDK

* `get_access_tokens_access_tokens_` - Reads the properties for a set of access tokens.
 
{accessTokens} can contain up to 20 access tokens. These are obtained by authenticating a user using OAuth 2.0.
 
This method returns a list of access_tokens.

* `get_access_tokens_access_tokens_invalidate` - Immediately expires the access tokens passed. This method is meant to allow an application to discard any active access tokens it no longer needs.
 
{accessTokens} can contain up to 20 access tokens. These are obtained by authenticating a user using OAuth 2.0.
 
This method returns a list of access_tokens.

* `get_answers` - Returns all the undeleted answers in the system.
 
The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the answer object:
 - activity - last_activity_date
 - creation - creation_date
 - votes - score
  activity is the default sort.
 
 It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.

 
This method returns a list of answers.

* `get_answers_ids_` - Gets the set of answers identified by ids.
 
This is meant for batch fetcing of questions. A useful trick to poll for updates is to sort by activity, with a minimum date of the last time you polled.
 
{ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for answer_id on answer objects.
 
The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the answer object:
 - activity - last_activity_date
 - creation - creation_date
 - votes - score
  activity is the default sort.
 
 It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.

 
This method returns a list of answers.

* `get_answers_ids_comments` - Gets the comments on a set of answers.
 
If you know that you have an answer id and need the comments, use this method. If you know you have a question id, use /questions/{id}/comments. If you are unsure, use /posts/{id}/comments.
 
{ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for answer_id on answer objects.
 
The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the comment object:
 - creation - creation_date
 - votes - score
  creation is the default sort.
 
 It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.

 
This method returns a list of comments.

* `get_apps_access_tokens_de_authenticate` - Passing valid access_tokens to this method causes the application that created them to be de-authorized by the user associated with each access_token. This will remove the application from their apps tab, and cause all other existing access_tokens to be destroyed.
 
This method is meant for uninstalling applications, recovering from access_token leaks, or simply as a stronger form of /access-tokens/{accessTokens}/invalidate.
 
Nothing prevents a user from re-authenticate to an application that has de-authenticated itself, the user will be prompted to approve the application again however.
 
{accessTokens} can contain up to 20 access tokens. These are obtained by authenticating a user using OAuth 2.0.
 
This method returns a list of access_tokens.

* `get_badges` - Returns all the badges in the system.
 
Badge sorts are a tad complicated. For the purposes of sorting (and min/max) tag_based is considered to be greater than named.
 
This means that you can get a list of all tag based badges by passing min=tag_based, and conversely all the named badges by passing max=named, with sort=type.
 
For ranks, bronze is greater than silver which is greater than gold. Along with sort=rank, set max=gold for just gold badges, max=silver&min=silver for just silver, and min=bronze for just bronze.
 
rank is the default sort.
 
This method returns a list of badges.

* `get_badges_ids_` - Gets the badges identified in id.
 
Note that badge ids are not constant across sites, and thus should be looked up via the /badges method. A badge id on a single site is, however, guaranteed to be stable.
 
Badge sorts are a tad complicated. For the purposes of sorting (and min/max) tag_based is considered to be greater than named.
 
This means that you can get a list of all tag based badges by passing min=tag_based, and conversely all the named badges by passing max=named, with sort=type.
 
For ranks, bronze is greater than silver which is greater than gold. Along with sort=rank, set max=gold for just gold badges, max=silver&min=silver for just silver, and min=bronze for just bronze.
 
rank is the default sort.
 
{ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for badge_id on badge objects.
 
This method returns a list of badges.

* `get_badges_ids_recipients` - Returns recently awarded badges in the system, constrained to a certain set of badges.
 
As these badges have been awarded, they will have the badge.user property set.

This method returns a list of badges.

* `get_badges_name` - Gets all explicitly named badges in the system.
 
A named badged stands in opposition to a tag-based badge. These are referred to as general badges on the sites themselves.
 
For the rank sort, bronze is greater than silver which is greater than gold. Along with sort=rank, set max=gold for just gold badges, max=silver&min=silver for just silver, and min=bronze for just bronze.
 
rank is the default sort.
 
This method returns a list of badges.

* `get_badges_recipients` - Returns recently awarded badges in the system.
 
As these badges have been awarded, they will have the badge.user property set.

For the rank sort, bronze is greater than silver which is greater than gold. Along with sort=rank, set max=gold for just gold badges, max=silver&min=silver for just silver, and min=bronze for just bronze.
 
rank is the default sort.
 
This method returns a list of badges.

* `get_comments` - Gets all the comments on the site.
 
If you're filtering for interesting comments (by score, creation date, etc.) make use of the sort paramter with appropriate min and max values.
 
If you're looking to query conversations between users, instead use the /users/{ids}/mentioned and /users/{ids}/comments/{toid} methods.
 
The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the comment object:
 - creation - creation_date
 - votes - score
  creation is the default sort.
 
 It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.

 
This method returns a list of comments.

* `get_comments_ids_` - Gets the comments identified in id.
 
This method is most useful if you have a cache of comment ids obtained through other means (such as /questions/{id}/comments) but suspect the data may be stale.
 
{ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for comment_id on comment objects.
 
The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the comment object:
 - creation - creation_date
 - votes - score
  creation is the default sort.
 
 It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.

 
This method returns a list of comments.

* `get_errors` - Returns the various error codes that can be produced by the API.
 
This method is provided for discovery, documentation, and testing purposes, it is not expected many applications will consume it during normal operation.
 
For testing purposes, look into the /errors/{id} method which simulates errors given a code.
 
This method returns a list of errors.

* `get_errors_id_` - This method allows you to generate an error.
 
This method is only intended for use when testing an application or library. Unlike other methods in the API, its contract is not frozen, and new error codes may be added at any time.
 
This method results in an error, which will be expressed with a 400 HTTP status code and setting the error* properties on the wrapper object.

* `get_events` - Returns a stream of events that have occurred on the site.
 
The API considers the following "events":
 - posting a question
 - posting an answer
 - posting a comment
 - editing a post
 - creating a user

  

 
Events are only accessible for 15 minutes after they occurred, and by default only events in the last 5 minutes are returned. You can specify the age of the oldest event returned by setting the since parameter.
 
It is advised that developers batch events by ids and make as few subsequent requests to other methods as possible.
 
This method returns a list of events.

* `get_filters_create` - Creates a new filter given a list of includes, excludes, a base filter, and whether or not this filter should be "unsafe".
 
Filter "safety" is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
 
If no base filter is specified, the default filter is assumed. When building a filter from scratch, the none built-in filter is useful.
 
When the size of the parameters being sent to this method grows to large, problems can occur. This method will accept POST requests to mitigate this.
 
It is not expected that many applications will call this method at runtime, filters should be pre-calculated and "baked in" in the common cases. Furthermore, there are a number of built-in filters which cover common use cases.
 
This method returns a single filter.

* `get_filters_filters_` - Returns the fields included by the given filters, and the "safeness" of those filters.
 
It is not expected that this method will be consumed by many applications at runtime, it is provided to aid in debugging.

This is most useful when confirming that an account_id is in fact "new" to an application.
 
Account merges can happen for a wide range of reasons, applications should not make assumptions that merges have particular causes.
 
Note that accounts are managed at a network level, users on a site may be merged due to an account level merge but there is no guarantee that a merge has an effect on any particular site.

* `get_posts` - Fetches all posts (questions and answers) on the site.
 
In many ways this method is the union of /questions and /answers, returning both sets of data albeit only the common fields.
 
Most applications should use the question or answer specific methods, but /posts is available for those rare cases where any activity is of intereset. Examples of such queries would be: "all posts on Jan. 1st 2011" or "top 10 posts by score of all time".
 
The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the post object:
 - activity - last_activity_date
 - creation - creation_date

* `get_questions_ids_related` - Returns questions that the site considers related to those identified in {ids}.
 
The algorithm for determining if questions are related is not documented, and subject to change at any time. Futhermore, these values are very heavily cached, and may not update immediately after a question has been editted. It is also not guaranteed that a question will be considered related to any number (even non-zero) of questions, and a consumer should be able to handle a variable number of returned questions.

* `get_search` - Searches a site for any questions which fit the given criteria.
 
This method is intentionally quite limited. For more general searching, you should use a proper internet search engine restricted to the domain of the site in question.
 
At least one of tagged or intitle must be set on this method. nottagged is only used if tagged is also set, for performance reasons.
 
tagged and nottagged are semi-colon delimited list of tags. At least 1 tag in tagged will be on each returned question if it is passed, making it the OR equivalent of the AND version of tagged on /questions.
