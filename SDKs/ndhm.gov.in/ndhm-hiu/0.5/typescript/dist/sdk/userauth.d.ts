     *       2. AADHAAR_OTP - auth initiated with Aadhaar with OTP. Mediated.

     *       4. DIRECT - for authentication directly with the patient. e.g. Mobile App, SMS. In this case, the HIP/HIU is not expected to call subsequent /auth/confirm call. CM will do direct authentication with the User (e.g. Mobile App, SMS etc) and will notify requester
     *   2. **meta.expiry** conveys the expiry time of the token and the authentication session
