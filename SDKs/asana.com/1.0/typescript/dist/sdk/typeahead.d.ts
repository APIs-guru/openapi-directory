     * typeaheadForWorkspace - Get objects via typeahead
     *
     * Retrieves objects in the workspace based via an auto-completion/typeahead
     * search algorithm. This feature is meant to provide results quickly, so do
     * not rely on this API to provide extremely accurate search results. The
     * result set is limited to a single page of results with a maximum size, so
     * you wonâ€™t be able to fetch large numbers of results.
     *
     * The typeahead search API provides search for objects from a single
     * workspace. This endpoint should be used to query for objects when
     * creating an auto-completion/typeahead search feature. This API is meant
     * to provide results quickly and should not be relied upon for accurate or
     * exhaustive search results. The results sets are limited in size and
     * cannot be paginated.
     *
     * Queries return a compact representation of each object which is typically
     * the gid and name fields. Interested in a specific set of fields or all of
     * the fields?! Of course you are. Use field selectors to manipulate what
     * data is included in a response.
     *
     * Resources with type `user` are returned in order of most contacted to
     * least contacted. This is determined by task assignments, adding the user
     * to projects, and adding the user as a follower to tasks, messages,
     * etc.
     *
     * Resources with type `project` are returned in order of recency. This is
     * determined when the user visits the project, is added to the project, and
     * completes tasks in the project.
     *
     * Resources with type `task` are returned with priority placed on tasks
     * the user is following, but no guarantee on the order of those tasks.
     *
     * Leaving the `query` string empty or omitted will give you results, still
     * following the resource ordering above. This could be used to list users or
     * projects that are relevant for the requesting user's api token.
