  /**
   * typeaheadForWorkspace - Get objects via typeahead
   *
   * Retrieves objects in the workspace based via an auto-completion/typeahead
   * search algorithm. This feature is meant to provide results quickly, so do
   * not rely on this API to provide extremely accurate search results. The
   * result set is limited to a single page of results with a maximum size, so
   * you wonâ€™t be able to fetch large numbers of results.
   * 
   * The typeahead search API provides search for objects from a single
   * workspace. This endpoint should be used to query for objects when
   * creating an auto-completion/typeahead search feature. This API is meant
   * to provide results quickly and should not be relied upon for accurate or
   * exhaustive search results. The results sets are limited in size and
   * cannot be paginated.
   * 
   * Queries return a compact representation of each object which is typically
   * the gid and name fields. Interested in a specific set of fields or all of
   * the fields?! Of course you are. Use field selectors to manipulate what
   * data is included in a response.
   * 
   * Resources with type `user` are returned in order of most contacted to
   * least contacted. This is determined by task assignments, adding the user
   * to projects, and adding the user as a follower to tasks, messages,
   * etc.
   * 
   * Resources with type `project` are returned in order of recency. This is
   * determined when the user visits the project, is added to the project, and
   * completes tasks in the project.
   * 
   * Resources with type `task` are returned with priority placed on tasks
   * the user is following, but no guarantee on the order of those tasks.
   * 
   * Leaving the `query` string empty or omitted will give you results, still
   * following the resource ordering above. This could be used to list users or
   * projects that are relevant for the requesting user's api token.
