Call createShippingQuote to retrieve a set of live shipping rates. When you create a shipment, eBay generates a shipping label that you can download and use to ship your package. In a createFromShippingQuote request, sellers can include a list of shipping options they want to add to the base service quoted in the selected rate. The list of available shipping options is specific to each quoted rate and if available, the options are listed in the rate container of the of the shipping quote.

Use the URL returned in labelDownloadUrl field, or call downloadLabelFile with the shipmentId value from the response, to download a shipping label for your package. Important! Sellers must set up their payment method with eBay before they can use this method to create a shipment and the associated shipping label.

Rates have a time window in which they are &quot;live,&quot; and rates expire when their purchase window ends. If offered by the carrier, rates can include shipping options (and their associated prices), and users can add any offered shipping option to the base service should they desire. Also, depending on the services required, rates can also include pickup and delivery windows. Each rate is for a single package and is based on the following information: The shipping origin The shipping destination The package size (weight and dimensions) Rates are identified by a unique eBay-assigned rateId and rates are based on price points, pickup and delivery time frames, and other user requirements. Because each rate offered must be compliant with the eBay shipping program, all rates reflect eBay-negotiated prices. The various rates returned in a shipping quote offer the user a choice from which they can choose a shipping service that best fits their needs. Select the rate for your shipment and using the associated rateId, call cerateFromShippingQuote to create a shipment and generate a shipping label that you can use to ship the package.
