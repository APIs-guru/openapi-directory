     * gsiDispatch - Dispatch (Green Energy Distribution Schedule)
     *
     * Dispatch of green energy has two aspects to consider:
     *   - Availability of gerneration facility (depends on weather and installed capacity)
     *   - Demand of energy
     * Using the green power index (Gr√ºnstromIndex) we have received a tool to automate distribution of energy in order to prevent redispatch situations. Doing this alows to opimize resource usage (tactical) and leverage data for investment planning (strategic).
